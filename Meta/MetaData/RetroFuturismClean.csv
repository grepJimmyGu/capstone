It's been a long time since I've been back, but more than any other attraction Horizons had a huge influence on little Cermo.  It was basically a guided tour of the future, and not the far future but the stuff that was just around the corner.  You sat in a sideways-moving car that sat 2-3 people and moved through awesomely detailed environments populated by animatronics, representing future life on Earth, deep in the ocean, and in space.

I re-discovered my love for it a few years ago when I realized that there were a lot of people coming together online to discuss and toast the memory of the relatively short-lived ride (1983-1999).

I didn't see anything much come up in a search about EPCOT or Horizons, so I'm hoping I'm not exclusively preaching to the choir.  For those who aren't familiar with what I'm talking about, here are some links:

[Horizons1 tribute site](http://www.horizons1.com/). (turn down your speakers)

[Mesa Verde Times](http://mesaverdetimes.blogspot.com).  The blog of a couple of guys named Hoot and Chief who did what so many of us dreamed of doing when we were kids... they jumped out of their ride cars and climbed all through the Horizons environments, videotaping and photographing everything along the way.

[Horizons Resurrected](http://horizonsresurrected.com/).  This guy has been working hard to re-create Horizons, inside and outside, in the Unity engine.  It's come a long way, and his works-in-progress are available to explore.  My computer chokes on it, but my computer can barely play Minecraft.  Most people probably won't have issues.

And while you're waiting for that to get finished, here's the [next best thing.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr9IJzRvmwg)"	t5_2repb	True
