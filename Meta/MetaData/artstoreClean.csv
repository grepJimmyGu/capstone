1355946107.0	154h9v	I'm an artist, and I need to make money. Doing commissions for cheap, $10-$40.	jarwastudios	79	15	34	"This has become a very rough holiday season, financially. I don't want to get into the details publicly, but things got ugly and my wife and I had to return the Christmas gifts we bought for everyone just to make our bills. The upcoming month doesn't look like it's going to be any easier, and I'd like to offset that by getting some freelance work in to supplement my income.

So, if you'd like to see a sampling of my work, or a bunch of it, go to jarettwalen.com and there's tons there. I'll do simple pencil drawings for $10, more complex goes up, it's really going to be dependent on the subject, but I'm charging beans so you can have some art, and I can have some money. I can do full color too, but that does take a bunch of time and will cost more.

If you're interested, I can do my best to do it this weekend and put it in the mail on Monday."	t5_2scrf	True

1315960964.0	kethx	A word about commissions...	Metal-Phoenix	50	13	39	"I've noticed a lot more people of late asking for or offering art (for sale or on commission).

This is awesome.

What's not awesome about it is the prices discussed. Every time, I see paintings and drawings discussed that I wouldn't accept less than $400 for and people are talking *maybe* $80.

What. The. Fuck. Is. *Wrong*. with you people? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Are we so conditioned to accept the ""starving artist"" role that we not only are ready and willing to accept an insulting price for a piece but we're *happy* to accept it?

And you people offering less than 3 digits for a painting.... what the hell are you thinking? Paints, canvases, thinners, etc are expensive. Not only that but if it were easy, you'd be painting it yourself and you're happy to insult an artist for all the time, love, and frustration they've put into learning their trade? 

I'm a still an art student and I would never neither accept nor offer anything less that $100 for any piece even if it were 3 inches square. I have pieces hanging on my wall right now that are 40 inches on the short side that people keep wanting to buy. Every time someone new comes over, they offer to buy it. They withdraw the offer when I tell them what I'd sell it for. 

Why do I set such high prices and why am I ranting now?

Pride. 

Be proud of what you can do. Don't let someone tell you that it's worth less than it is. If you're offering what you think is a reasonable price, double it and it will then be reasonable to the artist (usually).

I spent almost 40 years of my life desperately wishing I could do what I do now. And now that I can, I'll be damned if I sell myself short just to make a couple bucks. Be proud of your art. Be proud of the artist you admire. Pay and be paid what it's worth, what the artist is worth.

Not everyone likes the same things in art as everyone else. Downvoting art that you perceive as ""Bad"" just robs someone who *would* like it the opportunity to find what they're looking for.

Okay, I have....48 hours to make a cool $50. I have to pay my rent and I also hope, somehow, to buy some freaking food. Yes, I am the arch-typical ""starving artist"" in every way and I'm sure it's annoying. But, I draw like lightening and I'm hardheaded enough to hope I can rock out 10  drawings before the 14th.

Shit sucks, so. $5 shaded pin ups. Ladies, men, animals. Single characters. You will get them within 2 hours (after I respond to you) . You'd be helping me out a lot. :)

Comment if interested and yes...you can pay me AFTER you receive the art if you don't trust me. I probably wont be doing revisions to the piece when you receive them though, because I will be working lightening fast and need all the time I can manage. 

Dont be shocked if you see this x-posted in some places. I'm going all out.

Hot chicks?
Super heroes?
Famous people?
Fashion drawings?
Boobies?
Did I mention boobies?
Because I will draw some serious boobies.

[Etsy Store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/walterberman)

My 91 year old grandfather has recently has [re]started a hobby that he had once left behind years and years ago.

He was a engineer for his entire career and used his mathematical and planning skills to turn into art. He makes these AMAZING wire arts and ink arts. 

The ink art are drawn onto a thick 4-ply foam board (""mat board"") with a white ink. He is also starting to do white boards with blank ink.

The wire art are wound tightly through a plank of wood that has been drilled, and has burlap stretched over it tightly. He uses a combination of copper, brass, and stainless steel wires (depending on the color/shade needed)

Please check them out and enjoy. We are going to be establishing him an Etsy store soon, and I have made him a reddit account he will be using for this.

I am so proud of how awesome these really are! Both styles are breathtaking, but I have to admit the wire is where its at, though a large one can take him roughly 100 hours to make. Ink can take a few days of time.

I think the discussion is valid. Right now, we have only sellers and artists in this subreddit and no interested redditors looking to buy art. How can we remedy this?

One thing I saw recently was [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/artstore/comments/g12zw/untitled_original_painting_16x12in_ink_on_wood/)- where the individual piece of art was displayed and a recommended price given. I think that's a valid way to do this. Maybe we're going about it all wrong linking to gallaries and etsy shops. Maybe we need to use this subreddit to list individual pieces of art and the price in the title. Something like this format:

&gt; ""Piece name"" artist/medium/size/price+shipping

so for example:

&gt; **""The Sistine Chapel"" by Michaelangelo, fresco on a cathedral ceiling, 12,000 square feet, asking $99,000,000,000 OBO + $35,000,000 shipping**

What are your thoughts? Also, any ideas on how we can generate interest in the subreddit from people looking to buy art? Perhaps this title format change might actually help things move in that direction."	t5_2scrf	True

She is an amazing artist and would like to make extra cash on the side.. 

i am posting here some stuff she has done for my family, we have it hanging around our house and get compliments when we have people over.. these works are on paper as opposed to canvas but are done in paint.. Other examples of her work available as well..

I dont know much about art but i think she is pretty talented. 
Post a link of what you would like, and how much you would want to spend.. just a reference i paid her 30 bucks for that painting of Notorious BIG (off the biggie duets album cover, she did it in two days)

Backstory: I am currently unemployed due to being let go from my previous job because I had to leave to tend to my sick two year old son. That was 2 months ago, since then I've been applying to jobs on a regular basis but I haven't had any luck. So far I have gotten away with making minimum payments on my bills and scrapping by for rent but with this short of a notice I'm not sure what other options I have.
As for commissions, pricing really depends on what you want. I can make just about anything you can think of. If you're interested, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM and we can discuss the details.

A buddy and I are kicking the idea around and it would be awesome if a few redditors could give us any feedback about the idea. The website is [canvasmatch](http://canvasmatch.com) Thanks in advance. 

PS - I hope this doesn't violate any terms/conditions. I really don't mean to spam anything here and this is the last I will ever post about it.

**edit** thank you everyone for the advice/feedback. You have no idea how helpful it has been. You are awesome. We have taken all of it into consideration for our beta version that is coming out soon. We've also built the site on a responsive framework now so it will adapt to any device that the user is browsing on.

1368245684.0	1e42p9	Traditional Illustrator/Artist - Struggling to pay rent therefore commissions are open! (x-post from r/forhire)	ThatAwkwardGinger	13	4	0	"Hello, [r/artstore](http://www.reddit.com/r/artstore/)!  
  
Here is a little bit about myself to get things started.  
  
Come September, I will be entering my first year as an Illustration student at one of the most recognized colleges for art programs in Canada. It's taken me three tries but I've finally lived up to the standards of this school and I want to take advantage of my artistic skills to not only pay my rent but to satisfy anyone with artistic needs. I have done several commissions in the past ranging from realistic portraits to creating original characters to fanart and more. In between looking for jobs, I would love to provide my services for anyone interested!  
  
Aside from my history of art commissions there is my issue with rent and the constant struggles of trying to find a job. Currently I'm two months late and owe $1000; once I pay this off I will have given all my rent money and be free of all financial stress (for now). Now, don't expect my commissions to be outrageously priced, infact, I'm open to doing a larger abundance of work for much cheaper than usual! After completing my first year of college (a portfolio building program) and learning new skills as well as improving what I already know my work ethic also improved greatly (in other words, I'm confident I can take on a large workload and am very excited to do so!).  
  
Now, I'm offering to create a wide range of things in a variety of different medias as well as styles. I'm also open to any suggestions, requests, or any other inquiries you have. You don't have to limit yourself to what is listed below. If you have special requests, don't be afraid to ask! (I'm always interested in creating new and exciting things.)

  I also must emphasize that all commissions will be digitally scanned unless specifically requested to be mailed out unlike the examples given here (which will cost more due to shipping but that can be discussed in private). I had to take pictures of these examples because I was temporarily without a scanner at the time but that problem is now solved.   
  
I hope I've peaked someone's interest and as always thank you sooo much for checking out my work (even if you're not interested in purchasing anything, the support is always appreciated)! Comments, criticism, publicity, and anything else you can think of is always encouraged but not necessary!

for reference, i've done commissions ranging from $125 to $250, whereas my regular work costs between $700-$1500 depending on [size and complexity](http://woodstainedglass.tumblr.com/post/10351412219/this-is-really-exciting-i-had-a-show-open-up-at)  
as opposed to [simpler designs](http://woodstainedglass.tumblr.com/post/8514011847/a-commission-im-working-on-at-the-moment-31)  

  
recently i had a solo show, and am selling two pieces on installment plans. one guy is putting down $300, and will pay $100 per month for 6 months, while another customer is going to pay $70 per month for 10 months. i'm ecstatic to be getting good prices for the work, regardless of how long it takes them to pay, so as a 'thank you' gesture, i'm going to build custom frames for each piece.  
  
[here](http://www.christopherrini.com) is my site with some bio info, and [this is my tumblr](http://www.woodstainedglass.tumblr.com) which i update more regularly with info about pieces i'm working on currently  
  
if you're interested in learning more about Wood Stained Glass, which is the style / medium i work in, or about the pieces that are available for sale, drop me a line.  
 
and, i still do any and all custom commission work for modest prices  
  
thanks :)

But because I've never done it professionally before, and due to my day job, I have no interest in taking on a paid gig with strict deadlines and other limitations. 

What I'm looking for is someone who has a script already, or who would like to write one, or knows of a place to get one, that I could then draw/ink/colour (the whole shebang). I'm not looking to make a cent off of it (unless of course afterwards it somehow got published), I'm just mainly looking for something for fun and that I could use in a portfolio to get a real gig at some point in time.

In terms of my style, I'd say I lean towards something like the Year One Batman Scarecrow stuff (something like [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_li9xfjWvOx1qc7r93o1_500.jpg)), but I'm open to suggestion.

I use a variety of media so the things to be printed would range from digital art to watercolor to ink linearts, both black and white and color. I read through [this](http://www.etsy.com/teams/7718/site-help/discuss/1481/page/1) thread and some other sites but am still a bit lost. Hoping you guys - whether you're a seller or a buyer - can lend some insight.

1) What are my printing options? I see the word gicleé thrown around a lot, what is that and is it better than others? What types of papers are best?

2) Any printing company recommendations? Either online or in the NYC or Boston area. Am I better off with an art-specific printing company or would Kinko's do the trick?

3) How should I be saving files of my art to be printed? 300 dpi, etc?

4) Recommendations for places to sell online? Etsy seems to dominate, which I'm totally fine with - just wondering if I should use anything else too.

5) What's the usual procedure for sending prints to a buyer? Do I hand-sign prints, are they expected to be in sleeves, etc...?

TL;DR Halp I'm clueless."	t5_2scrf	True

Immediately a number of reddit artists jumped onboard. During our six month alpha test, we delivered over $2,000 straight into the pockets of reddit starving artists. Yes, there was a project involving cats. Most importantly, we were able to prove the project does what it is supposed to: allow artists to make money doing what they love. 

Today we released our beta version after taking all their advice and ideas into consideration. Redditors were absolutely crucial to this and we never could have done this without them. Seriously.

And to any redditors looking for original, commissioned artwork I encourage you to check it out. A large portion of the artists on the site are from reddit and they are truly amazing artists. And to other reddit artists, we would love to have you. Keep making awesome art.

Title: Flights of Fantasy I

Author: Thomas Joseph Kenney

Also, I'm new to reddit posting (long time lurker), so be patient please!


What I'm looking for:

In short my book is about a little boy who plays too many video games, and begins parodying them in his own style. For the image I have envisioned, the boy (and his sister) are riding on a dragon over a modern-day townscape (kinda like the end of The Neverending Story come to think about it). The style I'm after is a comic strip style (not superhero comic). I don't mind the characters being a little on the chibi side, but definitely not super-deformed. I'm not looking for detail, I could care less about fabric folds or lighting and textures; what I want is expressions. I want the face of the boy to seem like he's viewing the greatest thing he ever saw (until five minutes later in which the cycle repeats), and his sister to want nothing more than to get off the dragon and go home.


Specifics:

Boy: 12 yrs old. Brown hair, blue eyes wearing modern clothes. Very excitable, always ready for adventure and if there is none, he'll make it.

Girl: Appearance wise, same as her brother. Medium-length simple hairstyle. As for her expression, she would prefer to have nothing to do with her brother, and wonders why there's a dragon in the first place.

Dragon: Western European fire-breathing dragon of the princess kidnapping type. Not the eastern snake-like variety.

Town: Generic suburban track homes that a typical middle class family in the western US would inhabit.

Framing: I'd like the top third or so to be sky which is where the title will go. The main action across the center third with the kids and dragon, and the bottom third is just mostly town where the author's name will be. This is open to suggestions, as if I had any design skills, I wouldn't be contracting out.

While I'm not super keen on opening a new print store on each site there is in this category, I'm curious as to how people like their stores. 

I'd like to start a discussion among people who operate their own stores (even better from people who operate/manage more than one), and hear about what you like/dislike about each. Have you ever compared products, prints, t-shirts side by side? Maybe that doesn't matter and it's the site design that you prefer, or the way they handle payments or their community team and customer service. 

I run a few print stores myself, and I'll leave info about that in the comments. What do you think?"	t5_2scrf	True

I was finally able to find a printing solution and just launched my site a few weeks ago.  The site is called http://www.indeprinted.com  

The name is a play on independent artists selling their own prints.  The way it works is anyone (in the US for the time being) can submit their high resolution images or artwork and set how much profit they want to make on each sale of that print.  Then, when someone buys it they make the profit they chose.

I would like a medium sized painting and it would need to be finished and shipped by very early May (his birthday is May 17th). We live in the US.

I would like the painting to be as close as possible to the picture, so realism is wanted.

If anyone is interested could you message me with an estimate (including shipping) and a time frame and possibly other paintings you have done? 

If this is the wrong subreddit for this I am sorry.

EDIT: It is hard for me to check this at home without him knowing, so I can only check this account while I am at work, so if anyone writes me, and I dont write back right away, you know why.

Im looking to commision some art work for my girlfriend. Its meant as a present but to be honest im pretty lost as to what I should get her commissioned. Rather than contacting people directly I figured I would post roughly what I was looking for here and see who had good ideas and the time to create it! I have a decent budget so hit me with your best ideas.

About my girlfriend: she likes pandas and unicorns and shes italian. I was thinking maybe a portrait of her and me? or just a portrait of her? Or additionally just something insane... like her riding a unicorn? I found some links of artists that she likes/has bought work from as a point of reference for the type of style I know she likes.

[I also do fine ballpoint pen drawings](http://i.imgur.com/V18SC.jpg). These, however, are so time-consuming that prices must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

I don't think I'm great but occasionally I make something cool that I'm pretty proud of. But even if I sucked, I'd still do it, because I love it. However, People (friends, co-workers, etc) are always telling me that I could sell my artwork and people would buy it (of course none of them ever offers to buy it, but that's probably typical). I usually just shrug it off, but I confess there is a voice in the back of my mind that wonders if maybe they are right.

I suppose it's more of a graphic design/typography kind of project but reddit is pretty creative so any form of media is welcome.  I don't need it to be Doctor Who themed, but if it had some subtle Doctor Who aspects to it that'd be cool. I have some dollars I can use to pay for this but it's not a huge amount.

I moved in June, flew to pick up my daughter for the summer at the beginning of July, and had my car's alternater die last week, and I still haven't even really fully recovered from the expenses of moving.  This is all hardly ideal, except that I've fallen a little behind on the rent for my studio.  I'd really hate to have to give up my studio because it's not only a place for me to get away to create without the distractions of the outside world, but it's very much like Pooh's Thoughful Spot for me (also, I store all the ""contraband"" possessions of mine that my girlfriend simply will not tolerate me bringing into our home...).

Luckily, I only need to raise a few hundred to get back on track, so I'm cutting the prices on my original drawings (some as much as 50%), to help get me back on schedule.  The print sales are nice too, but I only make a fraction of the print cost from my print store and it takes at least 30 days before those funds are available to me (the return policy).  

I'll be running this sale this week, so if you've had your eye on anything that I've made, this would be the time to snag it.

Hi there, 
My names Emily. I'm wondering if any of you wonderful redditors have any use or desire for some fine art. I'm working on supplementing my current job's income with paintings and drawings. I was injured on the job and have been on temporary worker's compensation since Valentines Day, and the compensation unfortunately hasn't been quite enough for me to keep up with my bills. My husband and I are moving into a house with some roommates, and the rent will be quite a bit cheaper, but I still have this mountain of debt that I need to tackle, and without my serving job, I can't see when that is going to happen.   

So my request for assistance is that if anyone needs any gifts for family members, girlfriends, friends or themselves, you might think of me and see if there is anything that I can do for you. If you've been really wanting your favorite TV personality glorified on your wall, perhaps a painting would do just the trick. If you've wanted to find a really cool birthday gift for your mom and you wanted a portrait of you and your siblings done, I can do that for you. Whatever you want. I'll do nsfw stuff (here's me working on a [nsfw](http://imgur.com/CJUGR) drawing). Really. Whatever you want.   

I have prints available of a lot of my art [here](http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/emily-jones.html) and there is a large variety of prices. 

I've made fan art of Lady Gaga for a friend [Lady Gaga](http://imgur.com/8BxWv) I'm hoping to get into painting a few other portraits. A few portraits from the Big Lebowski are currently on my easel.   

Here's my favorite [pooch](http://imgur.com/IjH15) in painting form. My buddy had me paint this from a photo I took of his pup.   
I've also done a few drawings for my friends. This is my buddy's [dog](http://imgur.com/7gM7A) and this is my bestie's huge [cat](http://imgur.com/jhEAJ).  

I've had some really amazing people on reddit commission work from me and it's helped me out tremendously, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart.   

 [SoggyBarSoap](http://www.reddit.com/user/SoggyBarSoap)was the first wonderful redditor to commission work from me. About two months ago, he had me do a drawing of him and his girlfriend for his girlfriends birthday present. This is the [drawing](http://imgur.com/mnv9C) that I did for him.
That's just one style that I do, but I can have it look however you want.   

[lockestockbarrel](http://www.reddit.com/user/lockestockbarrel) and [bsteinfeld](http://www.reddit.com/user/bsteinfeld)  both commissioned portraits of their pooches from me. This is bsteinfeld's gorgeous dog Cici that he had me do based on some really wonderful photography that he does. Here's [Cici](http://imgur.com/IY6oN).  There's a little tardis easter egg in the top left corner. 

lockestockbarrel had me do two portraits of his dogs. Here is his cutie [Mudpie](http://imgur.com/XE2Kg) and his other cutie [Frida](http://imgur.com/KcwiL). I just got those pups shipped out today, and I'm so excited to see what he thinks when they arrive.   

It would really help me out if there was anything I could do for anyone. If you're interested, here is my [etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop/Emilyblythe?ref=pr_shop_more) account and I have the majority of my portfolio and more information about myself and my art on [my website](http://www.emilybjones.com) PM me, email me or etsy convo me if you have any questions or would like to discuss any particular ideas, prices, or anything at all.   






TL;DR: You buying art from me will help me pay my rent and bills, which would be really awesome. Find my art and contact me through my [website.](http://www.emilybjones.com)  

Thank you so very much for your time everyone! I hope I'll hear from anyone soon!

We deal with paintings, sculptures, drawings, jewelry, clothing, and supplies. Most of the work we sell is currently from independent local artists.

Please send me a PM if you are interested in working with us or have any questions. All of the artwork we sell is on consignment. 

Thank you!

Make three prints and *delete the original source file*. Keep one print for yourself, one as a backup, and one for the client.

Of course, the number three is pretty arbitrary. The idea is to work in the tradition of the ""Lost Wax"" bronze sculpture method, where they destroy the mold after producing a limited run of casts.

I'm not a student of art, just to clarify! I draw in my spare time and have been doing so since I was young (I'm 19). I specialise in simple, cute and cartoony drawings (good for caricatures of family members, friends and pets) and anime-style figures. I also can do realistic style digital paintings and drawings, but these obviously take more time!

I've also done logo work in the past, and have been known to draw My Little Pony fanart for the bronies of reddit.

I want to encourage her by commissioning an artist for her to collaborate with on cover art.	the_nil	7	2	25	"I have read the first 19 pages, which admittedly will need to be revised, but want to encourage her as much as possible.  I feel that having her communicate with an artist about the book cover would nurture her goal of completing the novel.

The book opens with a lush green garden with a stone water fountain.  A thirteen year old boy carries a small girl dressed in white towards the fountain.  The girl will have a ribbon in her hair. 

As far as style goes I was thinking of enlisting an artist who is capable of multiple.  It is my intention for her to ultimately pick the style but am thinking of two kinds myself.

A dark oil on canvas in the realm of [this](http://www.burnside.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/images/Margaret_Slape-Phillips__Siamese_Morning__Oil_on_Canvas.jpg) and a fleeting in time/whimsical vector based similar to [this](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2244/2433661945_00baff447b.jpg).

Budget: $50-$60 (negotiable)

I plan on being the contact for payment and her the contact for style.  Ideally I would find someone with a website to show off their works and then I'm not just handing her an email address.

Ideas for how to better arrange this are also appreciated.  I am aware of canvasmatch and will explore that option if [/r/artstore](/r/artstore) does not work out.  I would prefer to help fellow redditors if possible.


EDIT:  I have contacted an artist to do this project but have not received a response yet.  If I do not I will go down the list my sister sent.

On a more personal note, I used to browse other user's shops and think to myself that getting 15 bucks for the smallest print was a pretty sweet deal.

Sort of a story behind this one.

On my blog a while back, I started posting pictures of people who had talents that really weren't that impressive (guy who wore a hat, man who kept squids on his shoulder).  An old friend of mine started commenting on each drawing and provided a humorous biography for each ""Entertainer"".  We kept going for quite some time and came up with quite a collection!

Most of the collection still exists on the internets [at my flickr, here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tenfiftyfour/sets/72157603972973327/)

Eventually I decided they should all be together and so I collated them all and put them into a book.

I drew 5 'special' Entertainers ( None of these five have appeared on the internet, they are book exclusives! ), and unleashed it unto the world!

I'm currently selling the book via blurb ( mainly because it's easier to get it out to the whole world that way ), check it out if you are interested!

[You can buy a copy of the book here http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1493021](http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1493021)

tl;dr : I made a book.  It is [here](http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1493021).  You can see some of the illustrations and read the bios [at my flickr, here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tenfiftyfour/sets/72157603972973327/)."	t5_2scrf	True

1370943228.0	1g40q5	"Looking to commission a stretched canvas painting of Bioshock Infinite [Desired dimensions: 20"" (tall) x 60"" (wide) (three 20x20s as a set)]"	H278	5	0	13	"**Desired dimensions:** 20"" (tall) x 60"" (wide) (three 20x20s as a set) [possibly larger]

**Inspiration:** http://imgur.com/YonO85e, http://imgur.com/DoF2WOq

**I'm a big fan of:** Stretched canvas (strongly preferred), heavy texture (not required)

I really enjoyed this scene from the game. Preferably, the ideal artist will have played a game to have some respect for the vastness of the setting.

Just in general: this scene; the infinite lighthouses and stars. No characters. If some of the water could be included, then great.

I'm looking for a one of a kind piece of art; no reproductions should ever be made (print or by hand).

Please post or PM relevant examples of experience, your thoughts, and whether or not you've played the game (it's a huge bonus!).

Thanks!

I can work with practically any medium, although Oil is my least proficient, and Watercolor is my most. I've a lot of experience with mixed-mediums as well. I'm capable of any style, and my interests vary greatly.

Here is my new imgur gallery with a handful of pieces I've done for people in the past. Please excuse the few shoddy iPhone snaps!

http://mrparafino.imgur.com/all/

I won a National silver medal at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards  for the piece titled ""3.jpg"" in 2010.

The image of the plantains is a piece I'm working on currently for a customer's living room. This watercolor is 24.75"" x 40"". It is one of three pieces they're having me do.

If you have any interest at all, __*please*__ shoot me a PM!

**TL;DR:** I'm saving to fund an apprenticeship I'm looking for, will work for what you see fit.

I can also paint pretty much anything you want painted, as long as its from a picture, but this may adjust the price depending upon detail or if you want a different size or want it on a different medium. 

The reason i am doing this is because i have nothing to do at the moment and im happiest when i am working on something so it really sucks when i run out of ideas and things to paint... and also hoping i can make a bit of money doing what i love of course!

OK, I just verified my email as I want to make sure this is at least semi-reliable. I am about to be a father. I have a part-time job I work under the table. I also do work as an illustrator. My first daughter will come in about two weeks. The only way I can make money right now in any meaningful way is AS an illustrator.
I just received a foreclosure notice a few days ago and I don't know what to do about it. I have a check coming but it won't be out til the 21st. I also have an over $300 electric bill, and a $200 bill for the internet (which isn't a necessity, but is for my work as I need to send out files)
I thought I would be getting my check for a new gig sooner, and I didn't expect my wife to have to go on leave as soon as she did (The stress of her job was too much and she had been put on bedrest.) I don't really want to ask for a handout because it's not in me. However, if you have anyone who is looking for any kind of art commission, I can only ask that you direct them to me. Illustration and art is one of the few things I can do well. I am also self-taught. I really only do this because it's one of the few things that makes me happy, putting out a nice finished piece. However that happiness is eclipsed by the idea that my daughter might grow up without unnecessary struggle.
I don't want sympathy, I don't want charity, but if you know anyone who has wanted a personal piece of artwork done who can pay in the next week, please recommend me. I can do things for as low as $35 and I am willing to work with clients.

I'm currently working on a commission for a new company, and had some questions. Here are the details..

* first freelance job. A student at an art college. 
* was requested for this job through the college's job site.
* the company is starting out, new, and is run by two people. Met with only one of them at the information meeting last week. 
* have to design two logos, and have it done by the end of the week. The sooner, the better. 
* the person I met with said I can name my own price. 
* was given simple guidelines of the 'feel' of the logos, but have artistic freedom (the person loves my illustration style)
* they said that others in their field may need logos or designs in the future, and they would give me a good word. 
* the two logos can be all that I do, and if I want to do more, they'll give me more design tasks for the company.
* they said they will credit me on their website, however, their website isn't up yet from what I can see.

So, with that information, my question was: what should my price for them be? Is this opportunity legitimate, or does it seem fishy? I'm still a fledgeling when it comes to pricing and if the company is legit, so hopefully you guys can help."	t5_2scrf	True

I have 2 very young kids, if someone is imaginative enough i would love it if you would paint or even draw them as young adults hanging with me and the wife at a hookah place or a restaurant or something.

thsi will be hard cause the kids are so young, but i'm sure someone could do it. even if it is a bit cartoony. 

I think my wife would love the hell out of it. 

Let me know. PM  if you are shy. no worries.


EDIT: if there is a better place i can post this, let me know too. 

EDIT: i've thought pf another idea.
would like a painting of my dad and me together in a professional setting. he is no longer with us, but i have pics. i would like him as a younger man just chillen with me in a professional setting. 

this would be cool, and pics with my brothers would be super cool too. so if you are good and can do either
1- family, even if cartoony pics contact me
or 
2- professional, pics of me and pops, pops younger than the pic i send you. then contact me. there is money in it for you 

these pics are for a home or an office. so PG13.

prints."	MrMoxie	8	2	6	"So, a bit of explanation is in order here. Been a creative individual most my life and only recently have decided to start persuing a career using my creativity as a basis. 

[This is](http://MrMoxie.imagekind.com/) a link to the gallery itself, there are only a few pieces now, mostly because I haven't taken myself seriously up until recently.

About the prints: All of the pieces (excepted for Mynd Games) were designed from the ground up using Adobe Illustrator at a measurement of 16x20 inches. Thats right, these babies are done in vector. They were also designed with 8x10 photo glossy prints in mind so those are going to net you the best results. Because of this, the image you see on screen is not going to be as rich in color or have as much depth, as pixels on a screen are much different from a photo print.

What I am I expecting this? Not much, if anything at all. I'm certainly not looking to become rich, or an overnight sensation or anything of that nature. Not only do I know those are unreasonable goals, but I really don't think I could deal with them that well either. All I want is to get my art out into the world and perhaps make a few dollars on the side.

What would this money would go towards? All proceeds will go to furthering my career as an artist. Mainly, since these are done digitally, most will go towards upgrading my computer so I can do bigger and better vector designs.

Do I expect to sell anything? No, not really, but thats not the point. As long as some people out there enjoy my work than thats all that matters to me."	t5_2scrf	True

Before he passed his goal was to get a store online for all the up and coming artists to list their wares on and when his sister took over, I came on board to write the store for her. Our primary goal for the store is not to actually turn a profit (truth be told this has actually cost both of us a great deal of money) but to expose these amazing artists and get them some sales! Because I have a mild addiction to Reddit (PHP/Android/Starcraft ;)) I thought it would be a good idea to list her store on here for the holiday season.

I like the simplicity of it, the fact that it's for the Firefly series, but it's understated enough it doesn't scream ""scifi geek"" to the uninitiated, and I think it would go well with a little texture (thinking oil painting?), rather than a Kinko's poster print.

I'm thinking 24""x36"".  Bonus points if it's someone local to Southern California I could meet.

Any pointers/ideas?

It's going on my left wrist.  I've been a Type 1 diabetic for almost 4 years now, and I'm not much of a jewelry type, so the various bracelets and necklaces just don't do it for me.  So I'm looking to do a tattoo instead.  I'm male, have normal wrists I suppose and am looking for the following:

- Integrate the [Rod of Asclepius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius) (I like this [star of life image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_of_life2.svg))
- The words ""Type 1 Diabetic"" in bold helvetica so it's nice and clean and easily legible if there ever is a medical emergency.
- Colors: Black/Blue/Red (not all, but a mix of those)
- Not too large, enough to be noticeable but it doesn't need to be obnoxious.
- Possibly copy the [Medic Alert logo](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_g5ttqiwQ0lA/StQwon_YPQI/AAAAAAAAATc/ujm1Z3c7HpI/s400/medic+alert+necklace-s.jpg).  See [this Medic Alert tattoo](http://i997.photobucket.com/albums/af93/SpeedyKelly/600_medic_alert1_101114.jpg) for reference.

I really like [this diabetes tat](http://api.ning.com/files/Ie6JaY7X1m8a*uLtyUo-ShSg5xX7QlfC*ckTYAm*qSPI4FYtdr775ExeGgUAx1XVUdYKzQQ26Lyg-Q1y*l6BSOlkn56bKyBe/P5020122.JPG), but I don't like the type face used or the black shading.  The symbol is a [Caduceus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus) which, according to Wikipedia anyway, is often misused in medicine.

Feel free to hit me up with any questions.  Feel free to watermark or whatever you need to do, if the art is awesome and the price is right, I'll gladly pay and provide some awesome photos of the completed tat.

1307735981.0	hwn5q	Looking to inquire about/commission a wedding invitation movie poster (army of Darkness / Fallout hybrid)		5	1	2	"Hello, 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to do this, but i'm i'm in the wrong spot, just point me in the right direction.

I'm getting married next spring and I had an idea for the e-vites / invites based off of another invite posted on reddit. 

I'd like to create a movie poster themed invitation based off of the Army of darkness movie poster (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KGAzcZ_s1hs/TcJGnqr-C0I/AAAAAAAADQM/t0FhWzej8Ts/s1600/army_of_darkness_poster_04.jpg), but also with a Fallout style to it.

Of course there will be some major differences from the movie poster ... overall I'd just like to see similar poses replacing me and my fiancee in tattered version of our wedding attire with a similar art style. 

Instead of just having her clutching at my legs I'd like to see her crouched firing off a Chicago style Tommy Gun at a hoarde of zombies rather than the skeleton armies shown

We're getting married in Vegas, so we'd like the setting to represent a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas (would like to include a tattered version of the welcome sign somewhere in the design).

Commission rates tbd via negotiation with the artist. I have no idea how much something like this should cost, so comments with estimates based on the description above would be appreciated. I would also need to see a portfolio of similar styled works the artist has done before committing to the endeavor.

Referrals are appreciated as well."	t5_2scrf	True

1307020308.0	hpw43	"Need help in designing what's to be my ""wedding gift"" tattoo"	fivegears	6	2	9	"So, here's the lowdown on this: I recently found myself married, but, the whole business of the actual wedding was too far away from most of my friends, so, they're throwing me a belated party of sorts. In this case, it's getting me a tattoo, with events afterwards being unknown (we thought it best to get the tattoo done BEFORE any celebration).

So, I asked each of the people involved to come up with something iconic to add to the tattoo, representing their part in all of this. After being surprised that I don't have a list containing 5 dicks, this is what they came up with.

    Bowling Pin
    Dodecahedron
    Cassette Tape
    Whoopie Cap (Jughead's hat)
    Defibrilator Paddles

I wanted to put these elements together in a fashion that looked like some kind of emblem, logo or somesuch, but what I ended up photoshopping together from google image searches that looks like a bowling-pin monster. That might also work, but, hey.

If there's anyone that feels like tackling something like this, lemme know. Thanks in advance!

She is a HUGE Disney fan (huge in regards to her love to all things Disney, not her weight). Anywho, I thought she would love it if I got one of our wedding photos, shall we say, Disney-fied.

Think taking a picture and making it into a cartoon in the style of Disney, specifically old school Disney i.e. Cinderella, Snow White.

Problem is I can't draw, unless you include Venn diagrams and Flow Charts, so I'm hoping some of the wonderful people of Reddit art can offer some help.

I'm open to the medium (pen and ink, charcoal, watercolor, oil, digital, etc.) and am willing to pay in Reddit Gold or US $. However, I do have some disclaimers;

*  I am interested in something done in the style of Classic Disney. Not anime, abstract, Cyanide &amp; Happiness, Picasso's Blue Period, Andy Warhol, Eighteen Century Chinese Pottery or any other style.

*   I have a picture to go off of, but would like to have a few additions and subtractions made to it. So if you're all into super realism and think you can't add my dog because she wasn't actually there and it will disturb the space-time continuum chill out.

*   I do have a firm deadline for this (I need it in my possession by Aug. 31st, 2013). So if you're someone that will do it ""when I get to it"" no thanks.

*   No giving my wife oversized Marvel superhero tits. Her tits are fine as is.

Anyone capable, willing, interested let me know.

THANKS!

I don't really have any concept of what something like this would cost, but I would love to support any local artists and reddit users in general. I don't know how large a ""large"" project is for an artist, but I was thinking of something like a ~~6'x4'~~ **4' wide x 3' tall** painting on canvas, the real deal, it would simply be an amazing addition this this lonely house.

The idea I've had rolling around in my head for a few months, is something like an epic spread of a large ship rolling on the crashing waves, something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Xxn0ymA.jpg).
