1368319942.0	1e5q3p	Buy restaurant-grade stuff for your kitchen (x-post)	KappaDerby	529	106	168	"I saw something on r/LifeProTips [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1e55eg/lpt_buy_restaurantgrade_stuff_it_lasts/), and checked here to see if anyone had mentioned it, and was surprised to find that there wasn't anything of the sort. I'm not the OP, but I can summarize why a restaurant-grade purchase will always be BIFL.

* Anything mechanical/electric will be designed to run for hours a day for *years*. This is a lifetime in a home kitchen.

* Generally anything at all will be designed to be used dozens of times a day, at least five days weekly. Again, a lifetime in a home kitchen.

* Chain restaurants demand their design (cups/plates/bowls, etc) stay in production for extremely long times. This means if you break a few of your glasses, you don't have to go out and buy a new set to have enough matching items- you just go get however many you need, and they're still in stock because you've got commercial restaurants generating enough demand that company still makes them.

* Disposable items come in much higher quantities at much lower prices per unit. Someone linked 2000ft of plastic wrap at $30USD. That's stupid cheap compared to what you'll find at the grocery.

I could go on, but I won't. I'll just copy/paste what I wrote as to my experience with it; you can also find it in the thread linked at the beginning of this post. 

**x-posted text follows**

There are actually a few places to buy this stuff online, in case you don't live in/near a large city.

[webstaurantstore.com](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/) is where my girlfriend and I bought our entire cast iron pan collection, a wire cheese slicer, steel mixing bowls, stovetop griddle (also cast iron), HUGE cutting board (the white plastic polymer kind, something like 1.5cm thick), and a whole slew of utensils like measuring cups, etc., for cheaper than any retail outlet, either online or brick &amp; mortar, could offer. Had to order it all at once due to the way they handle shipping costs, but we were able to plan the purchase out over a couple weeks to make sure we got everything our kitchen needed.

Their stuff is all what I'd call restaurant quality as well. I have parents lucky and hard working enough to have become wealthy, with a mom who loves to cook. I haven't told her yet,but I have a nicer set of pans than what she bought for (easily) 20% more than what we paid.

**edit**
Some folks are saying ""hey don't go buy a huge commercial grade oven/dishwasher/thorium reactor from commercial outlets, you'll burn your house down/go broke/suffocate."" 

I didn't think to include a disclaimer about the massive stuff, as most people would have to remodel their entire kitchen to even consider accommodating the space for a commercial oven, much less ventilate the thing. Take it with my best intentions, rather than the assumption I'm a multimillionaire with a kitchen to make Gordon Ramsay jealous.

You dont have to spend a lot of money to get started.  Talk to the people in the shaving subreddit.  They have lots of good suggestions and we take our shaving very seriously.  Gourmet shaving!  =)

Is there such a subreddit already? In case there isn't would you guys at BIFL be interested?

Also, is there a subreddit to ask if a subreddit exists?

UPDATE: in response to such a fantastic feedback in support of my humble idea, I created /r/WhatToLookForInA 
Right now it is in private mode since I have absolutely 0 experience in moderating and am looking for someone with experience in that and maybe later for someone with some CSS skills. I am in the process of inviting all those who have been supportive of my idea in this post. Please PM me if you have any useful skills and/or experiences or if you just would like to suggest tips and resources.

The coat has a detachable hood, which is attached with buttons. I wore the coat all of two times before one of those buttons fell off. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary in the coat. I walked around for a little bit. I wasn't all that happy but I figured, it's okay, I'll just use one of the extra buttons they provided with the coat (I saved the buttons for times like this). They didn't provide any extra buttons for the hood. So I e-mailed customer service hoping they could send me a replacement button. Apparently they don't do that, even though it's a coat that they still sell. I was polite, but expressed that I wasn't happy that my coat was falling apart so quickly. They said that if I ordered it from them, they'd help. If I didn't, I was out of luck, even though they manufacture the product. Needless to say I didn't buy it from their Web site. Now I have a $200 coat with a hood that's falling off and no button that matches it, so it doesn't really function as a raincoat. Wonderful!

There should be a subreddit called /r/bestunder or something for things under a certain amount.  Most of these requests aren't asking for something that is of the quality to be a lifetime purchase.  

When I think of buying headphones or briefcase that will be of sufficient quality to last many many years (if taken care of), I'm not thinking of anything under $300.  I'm not looking anything like that right now, but if I were, I would certainly want the absolute best to buy....for life.  

I don't even think everything you buy is necessarily going to a be a buy for life situation.  You might be starting out in a new career and need a briefcase, you'll probably get one that suits you now but won't be the one you'll be carrying once you're that high level exec.  However, if you want to buy that one that will carry you from starting out to the high level exec, then I feel like that is the true use of BIFL.  Sorry, just felt like ranting.

 This reddit is created to showcase high quality, durable, and practical products that can be bought once and used for life. I was inspired to create this reddit from [r/ShutUpandTakeMyMoney](http://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandtakemymoney). I noticed that sometimes there are high-quality useful products there that I'm interested in buying. Unfortunately I also noticed a lot of gimmicks cheaply made products there too.  Nevertheless this is a great reddit and I would like this reddit to be a companion to SUTMM.
  
BI4L is intended to fill a niche for only high quality and durable products. I plan on being a firm but fair moderator to ensure more signal to noise. Posts should be simple and to the point. Include the link to a place where the product can be bought. Begin the link with [BI4L] to indicate its a product that is from this subreddit. 

Link to websites where there are reputable reviews. I think Amazon is the best place because it is relatively easy to purchase from there and the reviews are somewhat more trustworthy (although there are still fake reviews there too, buyer beware). 
  
A secondary consideration is for products that are high-quality, durable and portable. Some users will have transient lifestyles and reducing weight, along with waste and resources is also a laudable goal.
 
 
If you have any questions, reply in this thread or send a message to the mods. Feel free to use the 'report' button on links that do not meet the criteria of BI4L. However, explain in the comments of the OP why you think this is not right for BI4L Happy shopping!

Second, the [Olukai Hiapo Teak](http://www.amazon.com/OluKai-Hiapo-Sandal-Black-Mens/dp/B001JYKGJ6/ref=sr_1_12?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368051179&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=olukai). I've had these for about a year and a half. They show extremely minimal wear on the bottom and, were you not to look at the bottom, they could pass for brand new. They don't have a whole hell of a lot of cushion, but they are very comfortable for regular activity.

Olukai is not very BIFL with their non leather sandals, though. The [Ohana](http://www.amazon.com/Olukai-Ohana-Sandal-Charcoal-Shadow/dp/B00B5TBVIK/ref=sr_1_9?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368051438&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=olukai+ohana) is very comfortable and has very good grip, for about 3 months. The sandals are still in one piece, but the neoprene lining wears off at the ball of the foot quite quickly. 

You wouldn't think the color would matter in a sandal, but with [Rainbows](http://www.amazon.com/Rainbow-Sandals-Premier-Expresso-9-5-10-5/dp/B000IE20UG/ref=sr_1_3?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368051562&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=rainbow+sandals), it does. These sandals, I must admit, have shown to be the pinnacle of BIFL. Both the black ones and the light tan ones have many miles behind them. However, if you buy the black ones, and you're a pasty white guy, they will leave black marks on your feet. This doesn't seem to be a thing that goes away, as my 4 year old black ones still can only be worn when it's not hot enough out to make my feet sweat. They offer substantial cushion for hard landings, but score dead last in the grip category. Seriously, if it's wet outside, walk slow.

Finally, we have the [Spenco Yumi](http://store.spenco.com/c/footwear_spenco-total-support-yumi-sandals_mens-carbon-pewter) sandals. My personal pair arrived today. I know people who have had them for many years with minimal wear. My initial impression is that they are of quality construction. They have the best grip of the flip flops and are neck and neck with the Keens. They're quite comfortable. Note: The fit is EXACT. If you're a 12 pushing 13, order a 13.

We kicked some ideas around but I've finally decided to try and compile all of the threads I've seen into one helpful resource. Let's get started!

(Disclaimer: I will try to link to the original thread and give credit to OP when possible)

**The Kitchen:**

***Devices that require power***:

1. [Coffee Maker](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/pdx98/bifl_request_coffee_machine/) - The general consensus seems just to buy a French Press, grinder, and kettle. For espresso, get a moka pot. If you want something electric, the thread has various debates. Also, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lv54v/my_mom_bought_one_ten_years_ago_after_seeing_one/) thread sings the merits of Bunn Coffee Makers. Seems like [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lv54v/my_mom_bought_one_ten_years_ago_after_seeing_one/c2vw3uf) by the OP [Joebobson](http://www.reddit.com/user/JoeBobson) is the most useful. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k7vpm/bi4l_request_french_press/) is a thread specifically discussing French Presses.

2.  [Toaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/pg4jh/bifl_request_toaster/) - Buying a toaster oven seems to be the route one should take. As [noshoesnoshirt](http://www.reddit.com/user/noshoesnoshirt) points out, you can cook plenty more things using a toaster oven than a conventional toaster. That said, toasters peaked in design decades ago so getting an old toaster at a thrift store should be BI4L. Here is a thread talking about the praises of [Dualit toasters](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jvij1/dualit_toaster/).
3.  [Popcorn popper](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/p1e70/bi4l_request_quality_popcorn_popper/) - Consensus: Just use a pot on the stove or a brown paperbag in the microwave, moneybags. 
4.  [Crock pot/slow cooker](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/oayfl/bifl_request_a_crock_pot_slowcooker/) - Seems like you want to go for the ""Crock Pot"" brand slow cookers. Allows you to get things cooking while you're at work or school, etc, without worrying about burning your residence down.
5.  [Food processor](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/orx70/bifl_food_processor_my_mother_has_used_one_of/) - No consensus that I see.

6.  [Microwave](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lrfqh/bi4l_request_countertop_microwave/) - Microwaves don't seem very BI4L, unfortunately.
7. [Waffle Iron](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/l17hj/bi4l_request_waffle_iron/) - Top suggestion by Waffle_House_of_Pain (heh heh) doesn't seem in production anymore.
8.  [Juicer](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jvlho/bifl_champion_commercial_juicer_the_toughest/) - shopcat suggests the [Champion Juicer](http://www.championjuicer.com/product_info.php?cPath=3&amp;products_id=13) and most seem to agree.

***Things that go in a drawer:***

1. [Can opener](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/oqsi6/the_swingaway_can_opener/) - OP suggests the [Swing-A-Way](http://www.amazon.com/Amco-Swing-407WH-Portable-Opener/dp/B0000505IZ) can opener which is currently made in China. If you have issues with that the thread has other great options. [Other](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/mjgx9/bifl_request_can_opener/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k9axh/bi4l_request_best_can_opener_either_manual_or/).

2.  [Cheese Grater](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/p877u/chosigt_cheese_grater_499_actually_you_all/) - OP suggests an Ikea grater which was quickly shot down. [This](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Box-Grater/dp/B0007VO0CQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328232212&amp;sr=8-1) by OXO seems to be the highest rated alternative.
3.  [Kitchen Knives](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k3xe8/bifl_request_kitchen_knives/) - lordjeebus' top comment seems to say it all.
4.  [Bottle Opener](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/npurm/bi4l_request_wine_opener/) - petrus_and_coke suggests a ""waiter's friend"" corkscrew with [this](http://www.amazon.com/Pulltex-Pulltaps-Double-Hinged-Corkscrew-Original/dp/B0055OGPWS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324791190&amp;sr=8-2) as an example.
5. [Pizza Cutter](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/uedrr/bifl_request_pizza_cutter_i_eat_pizza_5x_a_week/) - Phonda points out that you may be cutting your pizza on metal or stone which will dull your pizza cutter after only a few uses. Suggested getting a large, polythylene/plastic cutting board. If you need a pizza cutter it has been suggested that you use a [pizza chopper](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1CHPS_enUS461US461&amp;q=pizza+chopper&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=809&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=9493134017875605927&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ic_HT_frKKP20gHpkanmDw&amp;ved=0CJYBEPICMAE) instead.

***Things that you cook with:***

1. [Cast Iron Pans](http://www.richsoil.com/cast-iron.jsp) - As [paulwheaton](http://www.reddit.com/user/paulwheaton) points out, a good and properly seasoned cast-iron will be nonstick and pass down to your (to quote Captain James Hook) children's children's children. [KingJulien](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jus88/only_pan_you_really_need/) suggests [Lodge Cast Iron](http://www.lodgemfg.com/Logic-skillets.asp).

2.  [Bakewear](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/n35qz/bakeware/) - cykloid suggests the brand Le Creuset and there are suggestions on where to get them (or similar products) inexpensively.

3.  [Baking sheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/ohxqc/bifl_request_looking_for_a_baking_sheet_every/) - Most seem fine but they discuss the merits of silicon baking pads in the thread.

4. [Pots and Such](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lh3ck/bi4l_request_pots_pans/) - More cast iron suggestions to the top but has many other useful suggestions. [lordjeebus' comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lh3ck/bi4l_request_pots_pans/c2soyvr) again seems to be one of the more useful.

***Misc:***

1. [Cutting Board](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jw79w/boardsmith_endgrain_butcher_blocks/) - lordjeebus strikes again! This guy is everywhere.
2.  [The](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jvda9/rubbermaid_premier_food_containers_microwave/) [various](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/ktcmb/bi4l_request_storage_containers/) [container](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k2sf2/bi4l_request_nonplastic_nonstaining_food_storage/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lxws5/bifl_request_food_storage_containersnot_plastic/).

1367418378.0	1dhdap	Making it more [BIFL], an Ikea step stool.	vacuous_comment	262	69	39	"The Ikea [BEKVÄM](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60178887/) step stool is beech wood and only 14.99 USD at my local Ikea.  The wood is really nice and solid but to get the nice wood look you have to get it unfinished.

The fasteners holding it together are typical Ikea stuff, they work loose over time.


Hence, we do the following, [pics here](http://imgur.com/a/21EOn), 

* Sand the whole thing, improving the surface and rounding the corners a little more.
* Varnish the separate parts, 2 or 3 coats, rubbed with wire wool between coats. Leave bare patches where the parts join. 
* Assemble the stool with the existing fasteners and [liquid nails construction adhesive](http://www.liquidnails.com/products/construction-adhesive-LN903).
* Another coat of varnish. 
* Put [feet on it](http://i.imgur.com/ZrNpsWsh.jpg), in my case made of leftover cork and rubber gasket material, [like some on this page](http://www.mcmaster.com/#cork-gaskets/). These allow a little give on uneven floors, make it more quiet, and prevent the wood from splintering when being dragged. 
* Put [non-slip tape](http://i.imgur.com/Huowsash.jpg) on it, specifically [from here](http://www.mcmaster.com/#grip-tape/). 


Et voila.

Ours has lasted 10 years or so under heavy use (3 kids using it in the kitchen)  and will last many more.  I have seen the same item looking like crap and coming loose etc in other peoples' houses.  A small amount of improvement makes a huge difference and can make a so-so item BIFL.


BTW, floor tiles in the background are restaurant style [solid tile](http://www.floridatile.com/products/metropolitan-quarry), very BIFL and practical.

As a ranch hand, I've used a lot of machetes. This is the best, and has given me 3 years of hard service without so much as showing the wear. It's thick enough not to be bent by use, it won't rust thanks to the durable powder coat, and the quality of the steel is excellent. The handle seems effectively indestructible, and will not slip in the hand. The slightly odd shape and forward balance facilitate better chopping.

1363890612.0	1aqwlb	BIFL: Hoodie - Katahdin Iron Works Sweatshirt (not made in US, but relatively cheap and extremely durable)	allthehobbies	266	79	69	"[The hoodie](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/78499?productId=1245487) is sold by L.L. Bean. 

I didn't see it on Amazon or I would have linked there. This one comes in a bit cheaper than the American Giant hoodie and from what I can tell is made similar. I own the Katahdin, but I don't own the American Giant hoodie.

It comes in at $55 total vs $70-$80 for the American Giant. 

I've owned this one for about a year and it still looks new. All the stitches are double or triple stitched with overlapping fabric. Very thick cotton plus thumb holes that are reinforced. The whole thing appears to be designed for outdoor work. It has gusseted under-arms and extra room in the hood.

My favorite part is the zip up collar that is inside the hood. I always hated how wind would blow up into the hoodie and get my neck cold. 

I bought this one to wear anytime and mostly for use as an outer layer while hiking. The water repellent finish comes in handy. (BTW most of those water repellent finishes wear out after about 50 - 100 washings, but then you can reapply them with products you can find on amazon)

I got this one before I found out about the American Giant and thought some may want to know about it since it's a little cheaper. I'd probably still buy this one due to the collar inside the hood. If anyone wants close up pictures of the stitching or some part of it just let me know.

Cleaning out my dad's estate we came across a bunch of Ball Jars. Stuff we used to can with growing up 30 years ago. That he got from his mom 30 years before that...

I got to looking at them and there's stuff from Root Mason company. Acquired by Ball in 1918. Assuming they didn't keep producing under that name that means that I have something I am able to can vegetables this fall with something that is almost 100 years old. Those mason jars with the glass lids just need a new gasket.

I've always prefered glass to plastic for storage too. While pyrex bowls still have a plastic lid the rest of it is glass. Even the best tupperware manages to pick up smells and tastes over time.

In college I accidentally set fire to rice in the microwave. Fat fingered an extra 0. I let the thing cool down. I let it soak in water overnight. The chunk of carbon fell out and I still use that bowl. I can't even tell which one it is.

India still reuses old bottles. Every single Coke I had there had been used at least once (and by the looks of them some were probably on 5-10 times around the block). They pay a deposit on the bottle you drink it, it gets sent back. 0 landfill waste.

Glass is chemically inert. It's why every single chemistry lab in the world uses the stuff. (Unless you want to store your Hydrogen fluoride)

Yes, you do have to be careful around it, there are certain things it can and can't do (temp shock). But well cared for they're second to none in the kitchen. And I'd honestly rank it right there with my cast iron as far is BIFL is concerned.

Do you want a belt that will last forever? You probably have your research done on what this should be... metal buckle, thick leather, etc. So, go to Tandy Leather Factory and order the strap and buckle, then make it yourself. You could do the same thing for a wallet. 

Want some toys that will never break? Get a coping saw, some sandpaper, and a chunk of wood and make a toy car. You can find patterns everywhere.

1331823494.0	qxu17	I thought r/BIFL would enjoy this quote from Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels... 	iamnotanotaku	216	44	87	"“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. 

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. 

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and *would still have wet feet*. 

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”

I'm not saying anything in this list should be banned from having any further posts. Sometimes people have a very specific request or condition that merits some specific advice, but I think we need to tone it down. It's getting a bit ridiculous.

i browse this sub regulary bot not ecessively which means i am on here probably one time a week and look at a few links. What i always missed is a place where good request(and deliverys) and good(real bifl) posts get stored to see anytime. Sometimes i see something i really like but when im in a hurry i cant always save it or i simply dont remember it the next time i am browsing this sub so it just disappears in the endless depths bellow the frontpage.

What i think would be a great idea:

Have weekly(monthly) votings of things that should be on the sidebar, have a voting every 3 months what should be removed from the sidebar and both of those votings always with the possiblity ""nothing"" and the number of items added to the sidebar is determined by the percentage of votes that are not ""nothing"". So after some time there is gona be most of the good stuff on the sidebar with room for innovation/newcomers.

If you think this is a good idea upvote this for visibility and if you are a mod think about implementing this, thank you.

All of their packs come with a [Lifetime Warranty](http://jansport.com/js_warranties.php)!

My pack served me all the way through Junior High and High School, traveled around the world as a day pack when I served in the military, and I still take it with me to work and classes (I'm 30).  I have used it every week for as long as I've had it.  It's suffered much abuse, held massive, weighty books, other school supplies, and often my laptop.  There were times when I put so much heavy stuff in there, I was sure the straps would break or one of the zippers would bust while I was tugging on them, but they never have.  

I don't know what material it is made of, but it's very sturdy.  Could not find my specific model, but it is similar to [this](http://jansport.com/js_product_detail.php?cid=501&amp;pid=TZA3) only with a subdued orange and off white color scheme that reminds me of a 50/50 bar, and it has a brown canvas bottom.

When it gets so dirty that my wife starts to complain, I throw it in the washing machine.  Boom, brand new looking pack!

There was one time that I actually sold these packs while working in a sporting goods store.  Jansport as a company was wonderful to work with, and in the *very few* instances where I heard of a pack breaking down, they would repair or replace it at no cost to the customer.

When I have kids, they will be getting Jansport, and only Jansport.  Fantastic company."	t5_2ss1q	True

1366000510.0	1cdd9t	After 12 months of use, metal parts of my Saddleback briefcase are wearing out.	toholio	178	30	76	"I've had a Saddleback thin briefcase for a bit over 12 months now. I love the case and use it damn near every working day. It's worn in very nicely and still gets compliments. My wife and I have another order for a bag and some accessories in right now. I debated whether to post this but since it might be relevant to another BIFLer I thought I should.

I commute by train and then walk 20 minutes to the office (great low stress, low intensity exercise and meditation). I am usually only carrying my lunch, a notebook, wallet, and some pens. I sling the briefcase over my shoulder with the included strap to do this. Unfortunately, the metal parts of the case might not be up to the job of being used with a strap each day. They started to wear through to the base metal quite quickly and once that happened it started eating away at the parts faster than I expected.

Here are some photos of the wear:

* The heavy wear eating into a D ring: http://i.imgur.com/5Xg3fFL.jpg
* Plating worn off a clip and some damage to the base metal: http://i.imgur.com/zOlMCO2.jpg

I would still recommend Saddleback's bags but if you plan on using a shoulder strap often you should consider how the metal parts wear against each other. At some point soon I'll email Saddleback to ask them if the wear is typical. I'm not wild about the thought of having to post it to the far side of the world for rework so I'll probably take it to a saddlemaker near my home for repair.

EDIT: To clarify, it's not just the one D ring and it isn't a chip. The D ring at the other end of the bag has the same problem. Both have a smooth, deep groove running diagonally across the ring where it hangs off the spring clip, which has gotten steadily deeper."	t5_2ss1q	True

* Furniture made of real, solid wood and held together with traditional joinery.  Preferably with a finish that can be repaired (varnish, shellac, or lacquer--no polyurethane). It's super expensive, but will outlast and look better than anything made by Ikea.

* Texas Power Bar.  It's a $300 barbell I bought when I set up my home gym.  I've dropped it on the safety bars of my rack loaded with nearly 700 lbs. and it's still straight as an arrow.  I occasionally wipe it down with light oil and expect it to last forever.  If you lift weights, go cheap on the actual plates, but get a good bar.

* Quality hand tools.  I own a decent amount of both Craftsman and Husky tools.  Plus, some stuff I inherited from my grandfather.  Spend the money to get the good stuff.  If you find yourself having to fix something, an already frustrating situation can be made worse by using the wrong tool or a cheap tool.

* Small appliances with replaceable parts that can easily be found online.  I own several Kitchenaide appliances and have repaired a couple of them.  A good motor is the expensive part of these devices and if you can rebuild everything around it (and be able to change the brushes on motor),  it will last forever.

* Cast iron cookware.  It's nearly the only thing I ever use on the stove or in the oven.  By now my stuff is seasoned enough that I can cook eggs in them and it's as non-stick as teflon.  It's cheap, helps you get your RDA of iron, and will likely outlast even everything else on my list."	t5_2ss1q	True

* Keen footwear. I still own every pair of Keen boots I've ever bought (3), and they are all still incredibly comfortable. Oldest is about 10 years old.

* Any statesmetal mug. You guys post a lot about cast iron cookware because it seasons and food tastes better over time. Statesmetal mugs do that to beer.

* Colombia hiking pants. The washing instructions (""wash me in the river and drag me dry"") say it all. Comfy, too.

* Maxpedition backpacks. When I bought a PS3 on Craigslist, the idiot stoner that sold it to me said I can keep the backpack he had it in. Turned out to be one of these. Incredibly well made and will stand up to any abuse that should normally tear it. 

* Rainbow flip-flops. They take a while to break in, but they end up conforming to your feet. Most comfortable flip-flops I've ever worn. Disclaimer: The black leather ones will bleed die on your feet if you sweat a lot. They stop after a while, but I just thought I should point it out.

Edit 2: Went out and got two pair of Carhartt jeans. One blue-jeans and one kahki.  The Carhartt seemed to fit better and look like they'll last maybe even a bit longer than the Levis.

Thanks for all the input everyone!"	t5_2ss1q	True

As the title says, a very close friend of mine is moving, and I want to give him something neat, yet not too expensive since I'm not in a very good economic situation at the moment. 

Do you have any ideas what might be a good housewarming gift for him? He is moving together with his girlfriend, if you are wondering. He's an electrical engineer, so he is quite handy so I was thinking like tools or something? That might not exactly be what he would expect from his buddy though.

DOUBLE EDIT: [I'mma let you finish, but this edit is the BEST EDIT OF ALL TIME.](http://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-Heavyweight-Hooded-Pullover-Sweatshirt/dp/B002G9U92W)

My family are mostly cowboys. My uncle bought me this hooded sweatshirt for a christmas present once, in plain black. 

It's non zippered, and very plain. However, that was in 2003-4? Here's what I've found:

It's not fading in the wash, at all. 
Despite near constant use, the elastic in the arms around the wrists is not getting wider. 
It's warm and thick and durable, it's stood up to repeated rain, and working in crappy muddy conditions without tears or unraveling of any kind. 

It also fits better than any other hoodie I've ever owned, and somehow looks better as well. 


Edit: [I added some photos.](http://imgur.com/a/AtJLE#0)

The damage on the cuff is all that I've managed to do to it. 
The grey hoodie I bought during mardi gras this year, as I forgot the black one - the damage you see is what has happened to it at work in that time. Also, you can see the elastic band on the bottom is toast after like 10 washes. 

The carhartt is still going strong.

Decades later, she went into the same Denny's and the only thing that hadn't been remodeled and replaced was that coffee maker.

Tired of buying coffee makers when they died after a few years, she bought a commercial Bunn unit and has been thrilled with it for a decade.  

Once she got it, and I told other people about it, I started hearing that some people have been swearing by them forever.  A friend was left a set of machinist tools and a Bunn by his father when he passed.  still going.

I've been lurking here for some weeks. It seems to me that 95% of the posts are requests. So as the wiki isn't accessible yet I may present you my three favorite bifl items. I'd be happy to discuss these choices with you!

1) Luggage:
Rimowa Topas Suitcases. These are mostly made of aluminium and will last a lifetime. You can send them to the factory in Cologne, where they will be repaired for little to no money - even if they are 40 years old. Great products, great service, fair price (imo): trolleys start at around $ 800.

Competitors: Zero Halliburton (any else?).

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/szvCd.jpg)

2) Double-Edge Safety Razor:
Nothing new to anyone who visited /r/wicked_edge before, but there are some really sturdy razors out there. My favorite brand is Merkur (from Solingen). They sell different types of razors which differ in length and diameter of the handle, the comb (open or closed) and the way the head is built (""normal"" or slant) and so on. Costs for the razor: starting at $ 35. Purchase advise and endless knowledge can be found at said subreddit.

Competitors: Many, e.g. Edwin Jagger, Mühle, Gilette (vintage)

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/h7QIZ.jpg)

3) Swiss Army Knife:
Army knifes made by Victorinox or Wenger are made to last generations. Stainless steel and precise engineering, a lot of different models. There are also some fragile models with plastic plating, avoid these! Price: $ 20 for simple types, up to &gt; $ 100 for complicated stuff.

Competitors: ?

1331394108.0	qqc4t	BIFL: Patagonia &gt; The North Face		157	31	83	"In the past year I have had to deal with both of these companies' liftime guarantees:

**Patagonia**: bought a fleece jacket roughly *6 years ago* that was starting to have some issues. The zippers were screwy and the stitching around one of the pockets was messed up. The jacket is too small for me now anyways, but it would be perfect for my girlfriend. I took it into the store and showed them the issues with it. The girl profusely apologized that they no longer made that model, but **would I be willing to accept an exchange for an R4 fleece, which is the most comparable thing they currently sell?** umm. YES! She went over, grabbed the same size off the shelf, did something on the computer, handed it to me and said have a nice day. That was it. Seriously. I couldn't believe it. Not only did I get a brand new (probably way better), it was free and took all of 5 minutes to do. 

North Face: I bought this $350 Alpine Summit Series jacket for the winter this year. (First week of December '11). Even as I was buying it I was thinking ""I like patagonia, I shouldn't stray"" but the cost savings were pretty significant and I knew they also had a lifetime guarantee, so I went with it. I do like the coat, but there are a lot of things wrong with it. The plastic in the hood (rain visor thing) was cracked from the beginning and didn't look right. **The Zippers SUCK** seriously, It caught the lining at least once a day and I had to struggle to get it usable again. Yesterday it finally broke, one of the pockets' zipper just came right off. I was pissed. I had it for less than 3 months and it is already all messed up. I took it in and the guy was like ""ok ill send it in for you. You should have it back in 6 weeks."" So I tell him that does me no good, because it is still winter, so I will have to go over to Patagonia and buy another coat anyways, meaning I will no longer even need this one to be repaired. ""Well I'm sorry sir but that is all that we can do for you"" So i try to communicate that because they sell a sub-par product, I now have to buy 2, &gt;$300 coats this winter, and if that is the case, I don't want/need this one any more and I would prefer to return it. Again he says ""I apologize for the inconvenience but all that I can do for you is send it in to get repaired and you should have it back within 6 weeks"". I left the store because I can't afford to buy another coat right now. So I have to ride out the winter with a $350 busted jacket (that was only ""good"" for 3 months). Ridiculous. 

tl:dr fuck the north face. Their warranty does exist and is better than nothing, but Patagonia just blows them away. Worth the extra expense every time. "	t5_2ss1q	True

Last week it was making strange noises, so we called service and the guy confirmed there was a problem, and a major repair was required. He said they almost never see this, and seemed almost embarrassed, as did the service rep on the phone. Yesterday they installed our brand-new replacement, no charge, despite being well out of warranty. They said we should expect 15-20 years out of their washer, not 4. My wife noticed in their local ads that the washers now come with a 10-year warranty.

This contrasts nicely with our experience with LG. We had their top-end washer with a 5-year warranty, and just before the warranty was set to expire the washer broke. The service guy looked at it and said there were many broken &amp; damaged parts. The company refused the warranty claim because they said the unwarranted parts breaking was the cause of the warranted parts breaking, so they weren't going to cover anything.

This will make it hard for me to buy an appliance that is not Miele."	t5_2ss1q	True

Some reasons why:
1. Welted construction
2. Made from a single piece of waxed leather (minimizes seams)
3. Rubber toe protector
4. ***Vibram sole (that can be re-soled)
5. GORE-TEX lining
6. Italian hand made

I just got a pair of these boots and have been wearing them on some hikes in the White Mountains.  They are incredibly durable yet comfortable, they have a large toe box for people with wide feet (or people who like to have some room) but don't cause your feet to slide around, no blisters yet since getting them.  The first thing you notice when you first get them is how ""solid"" they are.

**READ [THIS COMMENT](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/zzbvr/request_earbuds_that_last/c69bb82) TO SEE WHICH ONES I BOUGHT!!**

I'll keep it short:

They have to be cheap (over 50$ tends to be a scam, no matter the quality)

They have to be durable

They have to have DECENT audio if not better.

ALSO: I own a pair of Beats Solo by Dre. I've had them for two years, and aside cosmetic things that are fixable with scotch tape I've had no problems. I am more interested in earbuds now as a portable option, as the edit right below this explains:

(I am open to the idea of headphones, although I like how portable earbuds are and these would be what I use on the go/on the bus etc.)

Edit: 

Here are some things I want to emphasize, also thanks so much for the great response BIFL this was my first post/first time coming here and I'm very impressed.

1. I want the wire to be durable. the wire is almost always my biggest concern. any cheapest ones that have invincible or at least very durable cords??

2. While I still do not want to pay more then 40-50$ (I'm in Canada by the way so it's usually 5-10 bucks more for everything), good quality is a must. I would pay 2-3 times the price any day if the 8$ shit phones are bad quality. 

I listen mainly to dubstep and other kinds of electronic music, which is the hardest to accomodate especially with earbuds, so I've learned to be less picky but still, good quality is a must."	t5_2ss1q	True

To kick things off, here is a website to buy English bridle leather belts for a very reasonable price ($20).

This seems to be directly against the third rule in the sidebar. These rules are often ignored anyway, but in general reasonably. In this case, it becomes problematic: it seems to decrease the quality of the content, as this gives incentive to flood this subreddit with ref links. Moreover, in my experience, these links often point to cheap but non-BIFL items (I assume this is supposed to increase the likelyhood that the visitor buys the product).

EDIT: Thanks for your suggestions everybody, keep them coming! So far(and I'll keep this updated for future readers), the recommendations are, from least to most expensive, as follows. Anythng marked with a bullet is something I like and would like opinions on.

[**Ecolution Hemp**](http://www.naturewearorganics.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=50_208) - ***$5-$15*** - Nothing really wrong with them, I just don't like how they look.

[**Ducti Duct-Tape Wallet**](http://www.ducti.com/products.asp?cat=10) - ***$10-$20*** - I'd like something more...professional looking

* [**All-Ett**](http://www.all-ett.com/) - ***$10-$35*** - Maybe. I like how you can get them in leather or nylon

[**Tyvek Wallet**](http://www.dynomighty.com/shop/airmail-mighty-wallet/) - ***$15*** - Oddly enough, I have one of these already. It's used as an travel wallet(just for taking ID, money, and debit card/credit card/etc), as it doesn't have enough storage/pockets for my everyday uses. It's not a bad wallet though, and would be great for children as it's cheap and near indestructible.

* [**Fox Creek Leather**](http://www.foxcreekleather.com/accessories_menswallet) - ***$15-$30*** - These seem nice.

[**Roots**](http://canada.roots.com/men_wallets/mensWallets,default,sc.html) - ***$15-$50*** - I believe I had a Roots one long ago, and it didn't last very long.

* [**Innate**](http://www.innate-gear.com/product-info/portal-billfold) - ***$17*** - I'm intrigued, but I can't see what I'd like to see from the images on the site. Can't tell what kind of fabric, nor what the insides look like.

It is an incredibly machine, shows almost no signs of wear, is easy to fix, and sews anything you can put under the foot with remarkably high precision. I would say with confidence that you will NOT find a modern machine that has a comparable operational lifespan, equivalent quality and beauty of construction.

1362305458.0	19kl1q	Cherry G80 mechanical-switch keyboard	perpenis	133	33	84	"The Cherry G80-3000 is a mechanical-switch keyboard meaning it has a real switch underneath every single key. Not that rubber crap.
There are three different switch types:

1. Black Switch Linear:
Linear Pressure behavior.

2. Blue Switch Click:
Makes a click sound and has a ""tactile bump"" when you press it.

3. Clear Switch Pressure point:
Has a ""tactile bump"" but no click.

Each key is rated for 50 million key operations. MTBF &gt; 80,000 hours, MCBF &gt; 10. bill operations.
These things are sturdy as hell. 
The retro click sound is awesome in my opinion. I have my G80-3000 since about a year now and I really feel in love with it. It feels much better than a standard rubber crap key keyboard. The G80-3000 is also quite inexpensive compared to other mechanical keyboards which mainly use the same switches.

The product name has this meaning btw:

Q = soft = MX Clears

S = klick = MX Blues

P = linear = MX Blacks

G80-3000L(X)C(YY)-(Z)

X = click type (P = linear/black, Q = soft/clear, S = click/blue)

YY = layout (DE = german, EU = US with euro, GB = UK etc)

Z = colour (0 =' white, 2 = black)

For Example Cherry G80-3000LSCDE-2 is a black click switch keyboard with german layout.

So if you work on your computer a lot I can highly recommend these keyboards. If you code a lot or write a lot it is so nice to have a good keyboard like a G80.

EDIT: There are graphs showing the difference between the three switch types here. Click ""Models"": http://www.cherry.de/cid/b2b_keyboards_G80-3000.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en&amp;WT.mc_id=

I'm a particular fan of the Leatherman Wave. My first Wave lasted for 4 years before it got stolen. I've been carrying my second Wave, on a daily basis, for almost 14 years now.

The tools are incredibly reliable and virtually indestructible, but in spite of a ton of searching, I've never been able to find a good leather sheath for them. The ones that Leatherman sells through their website are thin, cheaply made, and rarely last more than a year.

So I was extremely pleased to stumble across this [Leatherman Wave sheath](http://www.etsy.com/listing/129825205/leatherman-wave-new-leather-sheath-plain?ref=shop_home_active) on Etsy a few weeks ago. The shop is called [Swiety Leather](http://www.etsy.com/shop/Swietyleather?ref=seller_info) and advertises itself as ""Simple leatherwork handmade in Poland."" I think I placed an order about 10 seconds after I saw the sheath.

I got my sheath in the mail today, and I'm really impressed with it. It's a little rough around the edges, as you'd expect from a handmade product, but it's sturdy, with heavy leather and quality stitching, has a good solid snap, and fits my Wave perfectly. Plus I think it's just a really cool and interesting design.

I should mention that I don't have anything to do with this shop, don't know the owner, and have (unfortunately) never been to Poland. I just thought it was a pretty cool product, well-made at a decent price, that would be of interest to people here."	t5_2ss1q	True

I'm not selling this directly, just recommending it because I love cast iron cooking, and a cast iron dutch oven is an absolute must-have for your kitchen.  The enameled pots from Le Creuset and Staub are fantastic and certainly worthy of ""Buy it For Life"" -- especially when you consider how freaking expensive they are.  The Lodge dutch oven has the limitations of bare cast iron -- it needs to be oiled regularly to prevent rust, and you shouldn't cook tomatoes and vinegar in it -- but considering that this pot costs about one-sixth what you'd pay for the enameled dutch oven, it's still an amazing cooking tool that has literally hundreds of different uses.  You can also take with you for outdoor cooking and camping, and not worry about it getting banged up; cast iron is almost indestructible.  I don't even have to go into the many, many things you can cook in a cast iron dutch oven, ranging from chicken and meats to desserts such as the famous dutch oven cobbler.  Once you start using a dutch oven, you'll see this is unquestionably a Buy It For Life -- and since it sells at Amazon for only thirty bucks (and free shipping), how can you pass it up?  http://www.amazon.com/Lodge-L8DD3-Casserole-Skillet-5-Quart/dp/B000LEXR0K"	t5_2ss1q	True

We have the money to buy anything other than the crazily expensive ones ($800+). The other night we were at Lowes (a home improvement store here in the United States), and we looked at maybe two dozen models or so. One that we liked the looks of and that matched our other appliances was reasonably priced, but when I opened the door for it I noticed that the baskets and interior panels were all plastic.

Some of the other models (more expensive) did have (stainless) steel interior panels. Yet others had internal hardware that was variously made of plastic and metal (except for baskets, which some seemed to be plain plastic, others might have been plastic-coated wire). 

How much will the composition of these affect the reliability of the dishwasher? Are there specific things to look for that will be good indicators of reliability and quality? I'm mostly worried about functionality, but I'd also like something that remains aesthetically pleasing long-term (no rust showing up on the stainless or plastic handles falling off, being broken).

The reviews on Lowes' website are all over the place. No matter how cheap or how expensive, there are multitudes of both 1-star and 5-star reviews. Some of the 1-stars are from obviously bitter and unsatisfiable people, others seem to be real complaints. I do not feel that those are helpful at all in evaluating these products... but I don't have much else to go on. So any help that can be provided would be much appreciated.

I also cave from time to time (but I have heard I might just want a cheap pair to get destroyed for that).  That being said, I don't want something that won't perform for general hiking.  I will be in hot (95F/35C) and cold (15F/-10C) environments (however both extremes won't be too common), and while waterproof isn't necessary, I would pay extra for it.

I don't have preferences for any specific materials and weight isn't as much of a concern (prefer comfort, stability, durability).  Resoling is a bonus, but not necessary.  I would also very much like to try them on if at all possible, as I've worn anything from a 10.5 6E to a 13 2E  (but usually am 11.5 4E to 12.5 4E).

I had read good things about the durability of Asolo, but the reviews [here](http://www.amazon.com/Asolo-FSN-95-GTX-Boot/dp/B000VGSZ82) scare me.

I've been wearing my boots almost exclusively in those two years.  I'm a really large guy, and finding shoes that fit is always a challenge, and finding some that last is an even greater challenge.  

I have yet to own a pair of shoes that I do not wear almost totally though the sole over the course of a year to a year and a half.  At 6'9"" and close to 300lbs, I would have to pay an obscene amount of money to get shoes that would last more than six months. I'm not horribly wealthy, so the promise of a $150 pair of boots that would last ""forever"" seemed like a great deal. 

We've all read about the quality of them. They aren't the Docs they made back in the 70s. They are the ""Taiwanese"" docs that tend to be a little lower quality.  A lot of people have dumped on this product because of this.  I've had some trepidatious faith that the wear I put on my shoes would be acceptance and repaired.  

I've learned some things though.  According to the customer service rep I talked to though email - the inspection process is absolutely minimal. They basically check to see if you have 1) enclosed shoes in your box and 2) those shoes are docs ""for life.""  As long as you satisfy both 1 and 2, they send you a new pair of boots in the same size/style you ordered (they had to call me to confirm my size as it had long since worn off).  They said all that fine print about ""no damage to the footbed"" thing wasn't anything they looked at at all.  

After two years, there were spots on the ball of the foot that were totally bare of tread. The rest of the shoe was fine and still water-tight (they survived a trip to Colorado in the winter and hiking without letting my feet get wet).  I got my new boots in less than a week.  

Anyone have any questions they'd like to ask about this?  "	t5_2ss1q	True

1327013468.0	onyk9	Knowing something is BIFL can take a long time.  What are your methods for evaluating a *new* product as BIFL?  Here are mine.	jlbraun	118	24	42	"BIFL is a paradox.  By the time you realize that you've used X for 30 years, it's changed design and moved manufacturing to China, so now it sucks.  You need to be able to evaluate the BIFLness of something without having to actually use it for a long time.

Here are some of my methods.

Clothing - Tug strongly on the seams and collar.  If stretchy, the seam should return to its original shape without bunching or warping.  Push a thumb strongly into the fabric.  The fabric should return to its original flatness and not show a divot.

Power tools - Wiggle all parts of it that are wiggle-able.  Look for bearings (not bushings) on all moving parts that matter.  Things that are meant to move should not be able to be moved perpendicular to their designed direction of movement.  Look for big heavy power cords with thick heavy insulation.  Yank on the power cord where it attaches to the tool and look for stretching.  Look for the minimum amount of plastic.  Things that wear should be user-accessible and replaceable.  Read the manual and look for a list of order-able replacement parts and an exploded view drawing.

Shoes - Flex and twist them stoutly.  No visible gaps should appear at the welt of the shoe, nor should the sole crack.  No visible cracking should appear in the leather or its finish.

Leathergoods - learn the difference between top grain, full grain, and genuine leather.  Look for the quality and thickness of the stitches at the corners and hidden seams.  There should be no loose stitching.

In general - Drop it on the hard floor of the store.  Oops.  Did it break?  Step on it a few times.  Still good?"	t5_2ss1q	True

A big topic that often comes up when discussing BIFL items is that a certain item is likely to be useful for a long time due the fact that it is easily serviceable/repairable.

What are some items that are remarkable for their ability to be readily repaired/overhauled, big or small?

Just to get started -- 

* I don't have one, but I understand the Kawasaki KLR650 motorcycle would fit into this category.

* Toilets are kind of amazing like this too... You can replace the whole guts, usually with better parts, for $15, and as long as the porcelain isn't broken or the finish messed up, you basically have a new device in terms of functionality.

* Zippo lighters.

The first two pair haven't seen much wear so I will concentrate on the logger pair which has double paneled front legs for extra protection.

I've worn these logger pants on my motorcycle, while delivering pizzas on a scooter, and while working on a farm(everything from construction to fencing with barbed wire to digging irrigation trenches). They washed out their color rather quick, I would probably blame the rains of Seattle doing this and it wasn't a big issue for a pair of work pants. They stood up well to a slow speed, &lt;10 mph, crash on my scooter; little to no abrasion damage to the pants which I was pleased with. However recently they've developed a couple holes around the crotch gusset which I'm very disappointed by. [Images](http://imgur.com/a/UhhM2).

These pants have served me pretty well but only for just over 13 months. Overall I'd have to say I wouldn't buy them again and couldn't recommend them to anyone here on /r/buyitforlife, they just don't stand up in my experience. I'll also add that their mailing list is very intrusive and I was forced to add it to my spam filter.

Anybody else have a similar or different experience with these pants?

1365817546.0	1c8vdm	Darn Tough Disappointment	Axana	115	36	43	"After reading numerous positive reviews in this subreddit about Darn Tough socks, I purchased a pair of their extremely thick Mountaineering socks in late January 2013. Today, April 12, I developed a big hole in heel. Considering the price I paid for these socks, this is unacceptable and extremely disappointing.

I didn't do anything unusual to these socks. I only wore them around the house. I washed them according the package directions (delicate cycle, warm water), and always line-dried them. I didn't snag them on anything . There's no reason why I should have a hole in them this early.

I emailed the company and am waiting to hear how to return them via their lifetime guarantee.

Is it unusual for Darn Tough socks to get holes in them this quickly? Has anyone else noticed a downturn in the quality of their socks?

RationalArgumentMan	120	42	62	"As the title says, I'm looking to buy a heavy duty bolt cutter.

In any case... why is even asking about a bolt cutter such a controversial thing? I mean sure they're used for stealing things, but so are other power tools, right?

Hope you all can help me out with this! We're in no rush because there's nothing in that box that needs to be removed urgently-- she just wants to put a new lock on it.

What things are simply not worth trying to ""Buy for Life""?  Are we looking to simply have a high quality item, so we don't spend more on cheaper ones through the same time period, or is it an anti-consumption point of view?

What prompted this question was a post regarding a stainless steel comb.  While it certainly was a cool product, it was also $25.  

http://www.amazon.com/Incredible-Unbreakable-Comb-Family-Pieces/dp/B003IX9I3G

We've all seen these combs all over the place, and while they are certainly not ""unbreakable"" I would argue that aside from intentionally trying to break one, they will last virtually forever.

Thoughts?

Griswold cast iron cookware -- It was scorched but just needs a good cleaning and re-seasoning now.  Some of it was antique and it simply hadn't changed at all. There were some other cast iron items like a smoker/grill and cast iron camp cooking items which were intact and serviceable.

Ceramic items -- Vases and bathroom fixtures were either untouched or else had turned a different color because the glaze fired a second time.

Coins - coins survived, but many were warped.


Stainless items like flatware were scorched and the finish was ruined but they hadn't melted.

Everything else was completely gone.  It either literally didn't exist anymore or was melted into a blob of slag.  I've never evaluated items with this scale before, but looking at what was left and what wasn't will give me a new way to look at things whenever I am about to buy something in the future.

This pack is going to be used regularly for hiking, hunting, and running around town.  This time, I'd like less bulk when climbing/scrambling and a way to attach things to the exterior.  I want something bigger than a trail runner and smaller than a ""backpack"" (30L) unless it properly cinches down to accommodate for smaller loads.

The sporting goods stores around me carry packs aimed at hikers that hate pockets or hunters obsessed with the latest camo pattern. A number of ""tactical"" packs seem decent, but I've never had one and none of the vendors nearby carry them.

Looking for the following:

* 20 - 30 L (1220 - 1830 cu in)
* quality fabric &amp; zippers, top loading is fine if organized
* slim profile (roughly 19-21"" tall, 8-12"" wide, 6-8"" deep)
* Waist &amp; chest straps
* Water bladder compatible
* molle or daisy chains on the front and sides
* preferably 2 compression straps on each side
* internal frame or rigid plastic insert if closer to 30L
* solid color (around town or at the office)

I've read through a bunch of older posts recommending the following.  

* Camelbak HAWG - seems decent, 23L, 2 loops on each side instead of molle, bladder encroaches on storage
* 5.11 12 - seems decent, 21L, no hip belt, thick fabric (1050D)
* 5.11 24 - 32L, once cinch strap, no hip belt
* GoRuck - $$$$$
* LL Bean - good gear, but none of the daypacks caught my eye
* Osprey - looked at several, liked several, lacked external attach points
* NorthFace Surge - 32L, no bladder, lacks external attach points
* LA Police Gear 3 day - never heard of them, bulky, zippers?

[EDIT]

Are there army surplus models i should keep an eye out for?

Also, I realized that during summer and when hunting I pack light (essentials, food, water, wear gear &amp; clothes). During the winter I tend to pack additional emergency gear, layers, and dry clothes.  For this, a 30L bag that cinches down might be better.  I have a 50L pack for longer outings (bit big for winter day outings)."	t5_2ss1q	True

What is a good (probably mechanical) bathroom scale so I can get consistent results?  My only restriction is that I'd rather not have a full size doctor scale in my bathroom.

EDIT/CONCLUSIONS:
Considering my space restrictions, I'd say [this suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1cqwry/bifl_request_bathroom_scale/c9j9tnj) is exactly the type of scale I'm looking for as it is intended for fitness and health care facilities so it should do just fine with long term home use:

But if you have the room, your typical doctors office scale looks like the most BIFL:

1361584733.0	1923g7	BIFL Review: Caran d'Ache Ecridor Pen/Pencil	that_physics_guy	100	27	47	"Hi guys, I thought those of you out there who enjoy a fine writing utensil would like this, so here it goes.  I bought my Caran d'Ache Ecridor pencil (it only comes in 0.7mm lead) a year ago (actually got it for my birthday, but that isn't important), and I got the pen for Christmas.  They are basically identical with the obvious exception of one being a pen and the other being a pencil.  In the album I've included at the end, the pencil is the one with the cross-hatched engraving, and the pen is the one with the chevron engraving. 

**Cost** - the pen and pencil both cost about the same.  Coming in at about $140 puts these at the high end of the mechanical pencil and ballpoint pen scale.  I make the distinction of pencil and ballpoint pens because fountain pens can go for more than $1k 0_0 That being said, these are not for you if you lose things easily. 

**Build Quality** - these things are fucking tanks.  The body is made out of a solid chunk of brass with a hole drilled down the middle to fit all the writing utensil bits.  These are easily the heaviest writing utensils I own. I don't have a weight estimate, but like I said, they're hefty for writing utensils.  The body is silver plated with a rhodium coating on top to prevent oxidation/tarnishing.  You can see in the pictures that the pencil still looks more or less brand new and I've written with it exclusively for going on a year now. I've even dropped it a few times.  The cap on the pencil is also a lot heavier than you expect it to be (I suspect it is also milled from brass).

**Ergonomics** - the engraving is not very deep, but I do get a better grip on the pencil than the pen.  These can get slippery if your hands are dry.  Compounding this issue is the fact that these writing utensils are pretty narrow (about the size of a normal woodcase pencil).  The metal surface and small size means that these can start to hurt your hand if you don't have proper form when holding them (as a student, I see all kinds of fucked up grips).  These are not marathoning writing utensils, as much as that pains me to admit. I really like these, but they can be murder on your hand if you are writing for an extended period of time (&gt;2 hours). If you need something well made but more ergonomic, check out the Lamy 2000 (it comes in pen and pencil varieties as well, and can be had for &lt;$100).

**Looks** - they are shiny, but they aren't gaudy by any means (unless you consider metal plating to be gaudy in general). Just today I let a friend borrow my Parker Jotter mechanical pencil in class and he gave me the typical ""woah, nice pencil"" reaction, and then gave me an even bigger one when I pulled out my Ecridor.  People will notice these pens and pencils.  If you're looking for something more low key, check out the Lamy 2000 I suggested above.

**Writing** - the pencil is superb with the exception of the almost nonexistent eraser.  The inside bits of the pencil are predominantly metal (I don't have pictures, but I'm sure you can find some if you look around on the internet).  The pencil only comes in 0.7mm lead, so if you just can't bring yourself to write in 0.7mm, you'll need to look elsewhere.  There is an Ecridor XS which is more or less a midget pencil that uses 0.5mm lead, but it's incredibly short and stubby.  The pen is a different matter.  I can't tell if it's the paper I'm writing on, but the ink delivery is inconsistent.  I write in a few different Moleskine notebooks with my pen (these are where I keep the final versions of my notes for my classes), and it writes like butter in two of them, but a little rough in the others.  The two that it writes well in came in the same package, whereas all the others came in a different package, so it could be the batch of paper used in one set of notebooks vs. the others.  Nevertheless, it does show that the pen is sensitive to the type of paper you're writing on.  I'm still on the included ink cartridge, so I don't know if switching it out will help.  That being said, the ink cartridges are enormous and can last you allegedly for a year (I'm inclined to believe it, even though I actually write a few pages every day).

**Summary** - I really like these, and I can tell that they will last for a really long damn time.  It's pretty tough to break a chunk of brass, short of running it over with a steam roller.  I think you can even send the pens/pencils in to the manufacturer (in Switzerland) to have them repaired if anything every breaks.  They're hefty, and they look good.  They come in many different engraving styles, so you can find one you like.  I definitely recommend them.

1358639546.0	16wgxu	Bought for life: Marmot Shell	los_rocket_sturgeons	101	29	72	"I got a Marmot gore-tex enabled shell jacket just after I turned full-grown, 25 years ago. I am still wearing it. 

It seems pretty close to this model: http://marmot.com/products/silverton_jacket?p=216,303 -- under-arm zips, lot of snaps and pull ties for sealing the bottom against snow, and a massive hood. Great seams, just totally well made.

The pull ties at the bottom were wrecked a couple years ago when they got caught in a mountain bike, and there is a small rip in one sleeve, but that wasn't normal wear and tear.

I haven't washed it in about five years so it's sort of dirty, but aside from throwing it through a dryer a few years ago to re-season the gore-tex (which seemed to work), it's pretty much worked great for 25 years. A lot of those years were in California so it was only used a few days a year, but now that I'm in Seattle I used it all the time. 

I remember the shell and a fleece were around $250 in 1988 (big birthday present when I was doing a lot of camping and rock climbing), so maybe $600 in today's dollars, but it's actually even still reasonably in fashion for a red and black rain/snow jacket.

This is just a shell, no insulation (just some mesh inside), but it works great. I can't vouch for Marmot's production methods today, but 25 years ago, they were great. May be worth checking out. The other reminder is if you're really buying clothing or a jacket for life, go classic vs. stylish -- it'll look better longer."	t5_2ss1q	True

I'm going to college pretty far from home, and will probably be carrying all I own in suitcases four times a year, back and forth.

I haven't been impressed with the quality of the big-name builders in my area (Austin TX), and I'm not sure if a custom builder would be any better.

Or am I underestimating the quality of their work? I can't put my finger on any one thing, but it just seems like there's a big gap in craftsmanship between houses made in the 70's/80's vs. newer ones, and although the newer ones may be more efficient, they just don't seem like they were built to last more than 10 years or so (which I hear is a common warranty term).

Any ideas on what to look for in an existing house? Or what I might be able to request from a builder (without jacking the cost way up)? E.g. specific types of frames, building materials, etc.

I'd like to have something to go on other than my gut feeling, and I'll take functional over trendy any day...

I did search the sub and couldn't find any reference to quality housing, so it doesn't seem like this is a common request.

I was hoping that by now, we would have more sidebar links which keep information nicely organized such as the kitchen one that is there, but that is a reality which hasn't happened.

Since there is such a large number of threads to sort through, a Wiki might be something to look towards in the future, but I'm not sure there's enough content for that.

I propose that for the time being, a few (or more) community members collaborate to put together a Google Docs spreadsheet which is open to view for everyone, but maybe only editable by a few. [/r/Scotch has a great example of what I am envisioning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsnkEzAVwhUVdF91M3R1NFdvQWYwY1JEeHNpNnZCbVE&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0).

What does everyone think? Thoughts, suggestions, alternative ideas, all welcome. BIFL is one of my favorite subreddits, and I would love if the community had a handy reference to point to instead of just ""USE THE SEARCH FEATURE, GOSH.""

**EDIT: [I have begun working on the spreadsheet, and once I feel it is headed in a definite direction, I will post a discussion/brainstorming topic for things like categories and such.

1330992246.0	qjbzw	Hankerchiefs. Get one, carry it. 	tekdemo	154	96	87	"Less of a request, as much as a public service. I've recently hooked a few friends of mine on them, and figured I'd bring it up. 

For you allergy sufferers, it's a straight up improvement over kleenex. A single handkerchief will have more daily uses in it than a handfull of kleenex, without any of the holes in it, and it uses less space in your pockets. It also just looks classier. Best of all, you just throw it in your washer. No more wads of nasty paper from that forgotten pocket.

For those of you who *don't* have allergies, rest assured, there's good reason for you to have one too. Especially since you probably don't make a  habit of keeping kleenex on you.   

* That nagging itch on your nose that you can't pick at? Hide it with the hanky.  
* Brisk day, and a bit of a slight run? Spare thy sleeve.  
* Messy eater? Use it as a bib.   
* OH NO! EMERGENCY SPILL! Your hanky's got you covered.  
* Outdoorsman type? Emergency semaphore or medkit suppliment. Or, get it damp, and wrap it around your face to avoid the harsh campfire smoke. 
* Awkard sneezes got a lot less awkward.  
* Cute girl in a polka dot dress waving at you from a plane? Give her a meaningful momento.  
 *French? HAHA, no, just kidding.  
* Hors d'oeuvre? Napkin!   
* Manage to get a date? Impress her with your class and sensibility.  
* Impromptu magic tricks
* Bike commuter or jogger? I'm sure you've had the brisk air nasal drip.  
* Classy gentlemen in a fancy suit? Fold it right, and you have a highlight for your vest pocket. If you go all out, you can get them monogrammed.

One has pretty bad allergies, and she makes a point to iron them into fun little shapes on her desk for storage. I got initially with the expectation that I might need it a time or two, and wound up using it several times a day for various tasks. Got a nice rotation going to keep em clean. 

As a final note, it's generally noted that linen are superior to cotton in every regard. If you're looking for a deal, shop around near Father's Day. You can score some pretty good deals. A single cold season will probably save enough in kleenex to warrant having bought a 20 dollar mass-pack of hankies.

TL:DR; Get a linen handkerchief, and be a clean, classy, practical mofo. "	t5_2ss1q	True

1375215078.0	1jde58	Had a dream about BI4L, thought it could spark some interesting discussion.	flapanther33781	96	37	18	"You know you're on Reddit too much when you start dreaming about it.  I just woke up from a dream where I was reading a self post from the owner of a small business who wants to be a BIFL company.  I thought it might be interesting to post here for discussion, as the dream was from the point of view of someone who *owns* a BIFL company, rather than a consumer.

In the dream the company was a small business that builds cars.  When I say small, obviously a company that builds cars isn't all that small, but I imagined it being the size of Tesla Motors, not GM.  He was having trouble selling to the large movie production companies, because they claimed his cars didn't provide a certain level of value, and he was asking for Reddit's help on ways he could improve this.  In my dream, I imagined large movie production companies (MGM, Paramount) having in-house mechanics and body shops that repair cars used in movies - even dismantling them to the smallest parts - to sell if the vehicle is damaged to the point where it's no longer worth repairing the car.

One of these movie production companies had sent the business owner a letter of rejection because they didn't feel the company's product represented a good enough value when broken down for parts.  My brain came up with the term IPV (Irreducible Part Value) where the movie company determined what the vehicle was worth when completely dismantled, in order to know what it would cost to repair significantly damaged vehicles or sell off the parts.

I thought that was an interesting idea, from the point of view of a BIFL company.  If I sell an item and claim BIFL then I ought to be willing to repair or replace it for you if something goes wrong with it.  Improving the IPV ratio lowers what it costs me to repair/replace the item, and increases profit.  Again, not sure if this is something that should be in the BIFL subreddit.  If not here, then maybe there could be a spinoff subreddit for companies who want to discuss ways to improve their products.

What do you think?  I work nights, sleep days, so I'm going back to bed for a bit, be back later.

EDIT: Sorry, I was still somewhat sleepy when I wrote this.  I forgot to mention something.  Having a *low* IPV ratio would be good for the company producing the product (because that would make it cheaper to repair/replace, increasing their profits) but it would be *bad* for anyone else who wanted to take the item apart and sell it for parts (because of the low resale value of the individual parts).  The reason I posted was to stimulate discussion of:

* How that balance might play out in the real world, and

* Because I think it would be smart for someone who owns a BI4L company to ask for help finding ways to make their product better while maintaining the same price point.

If someone came to us and said, ""Here's my product, it's got 10 pieces.  Can you suggest an alternative material for part #3 that would improve the quality of the item without significantly increasing the cost?"" ... I think that would be really valuable, both to the company and its end users."	t5_2ss1q	True

It was made in the 80's in France. It came with three blades for cutting and one for kneading dough. I love this beast and it gets the job done in seconds. I highly recommend buying an older/ used model. The price is much lower, and you get a wonderful piece of kitchen machinery that has already lasted years and will for many more. Buying parts isn't all that cheap, but considering the quality, and if you buy the machine used, its worth it.  The blades are still very sharp, and I've only needed to replace the bowl.

My girlfriend needs a new purse after years of buying cute but poorly made junk that falls apart within a year.  I'm thinking about buying her a nice purse for Christmas.

I'd like to get her something functional and solid, with classic good looks.  I was thinking about [a small tote from SBL](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Classic-Tote-Bag?sc=8&amp;category=301418), but I'm open to options.  I already have several of their pieces and am a big fan.  But ~$400 *is* pretty steep.  

Open to suggestions re: fabric.  If we go the leather route, probably looking for some shade of brown.  Bigger than a clutch, but not big enough to put a laptop in.  Stainless or silver hardware...she doesn't do gold.  


I know /r/malefashionadvice, /r/fma, and /r/bifl have turned me on to a lot e-boutiques and manufacturers for men's bags/clothing/gadgets I never would have known about browsing through the mall.  Does /r/buyitforlife have some favorite high-quality, high-value purses they recommend?

Purpose: biking around town (often in the rain), hiking, travel, and just having all the essentials in one place. I don't want to buy another bag after this. 

I don't want it to look like I just jumped out of a humvee or dropped out of a C-47 but I want it to be durable and MOLLE is nice. All black is preferred. Must be a simple design and lack of, or easily removable, logos is important to me. 

I don't want any gimmicky features like smartphone pockets and such. I don't want a bunch of little plastic clips that will get snagged and broken. I don't want fluorescent colours anywhere on the bag. 

It must be comfortable but minimal. I don't need sternum or waist straps, but the ability to retrofit some would be a plus, should I change my mind. I don't want a bunch or elastic around the outside that will just get snagged. 

I don't want it to be huge, but it can't be too small either. I like the size of the bags I had back in middle school. Bigger than a daypack but not too big to carry around every day.

I am looking for a jacket or hoodie that will be comfortable, functional, and warm for the winter months. I will NOT be in freezing temperatures, so I won't be needing anything too thick. Any convenience features are awesome, such as earbuds in the hood, and extra pockets for small/light tools.

I found this hoodie : http://www.tactics.com/grenade/tech-zip-hoodie/black

So far, its the best thing I've found, and it has a lot of nice features such as water resistant, the headphone area... and it sort of fits my job, so that's a plus.

However, I want to be sure I'm getting something for my money. Larger hoods, thicker fabric...

Any ideas on other hoodies / jackets that may work better for me with a budget of 80$ ?

While a hoodie is more comfortable, a jacket with more functionality would also be nice. I will have to carry a backpack, camelbak, and tools with me a lot, so the hoodie will work, but extra space in a jacket might cut down on all the stuff I have to carry. 

This jacket would be ideal : http://www.blackhawk.com/product/Warrior-Wear-Operations-Jacket,178,31.htm

However, it is a little too expensive. Even though it is a part of a multi-layer jacket, I would only need this part.

The jacket / hoodie cant be very large, like those multi-layer jackets with liners and shells and all that stuff, but can be medium sized.

Thank you for your time and help!

1347577552.0	zuik3	"Review of ""Advocate Briefcase"" from Custom Hide"	laurencetribe	71	13	30	"I've had [this briefcase](http://www.customhide.com/advocate.html) for about a month and a half. I bought it after seeing a lot of people in this sub-reddit consistently rate Custom Hide as superior to all other leather bag makers, even the beloved ""Saddleback."" While I am mostly happy with this bag, there are some pretty significant defects with mine that I'm a little disappointed by, especially considering how expensive the bag was. 

For the most part, this seems to be a really high quality and handsome briefcase. It looks professional and stylish. The leather is thick and makes for a fairly hefty bag, some might say too heavy for everyday use. Other than its weight, there are some glaring problems/concerns I have with my  bag.

1. Brass lock that inevitably gets scratched. It makes no sense to me why the would use materials that have this effect on each other. Perhaps its unavoidable. However it is disappointing that I will have to accept that the brass is going to look like a piece of trash. Here’s a [picture of the brass being scratched](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#0), and another picture of the [fastener that is doing the scratching](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#1). 

2. Some of the internal leather is clearly glued and not stitched. Some of it is already visibly coming apart. The first is of an[ internal zipper pocket](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#2) in the first compartment. The second picture is of what is probably a [facade for the brass hardware](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#3). To be clear, it doesn't seem like these things are going anywhere or will cause a problem anytime soon…I was just really surprised to see glue. Can glue ever be BIFL?
3. On one side of the brass fastener the [leather is not properly secured](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#4). I noticed this the first day I had it. 

4. [Some](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#5) of the [leather](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#6) that [composes](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#7) the handle looks like it is ripping. I don't think that this is growing, but it certainly does not look like it was intentional
5. I’m a relatively short guy, 5’ 10’, and the bag’s shoulder strap wears best at the smallest setting. This means that there is a lot of excess leather strap that is left hanging. Because there is no second loop on the strap the leather is left to hang out from my shoulder and looks goofy. I probably did a poor job explaining this, so here’s a [bathroom picture](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#8)! 

It might be noteworthy that most of the problems are related to the brass hardware. This feature seems to be the core source of weakness for this bag. I've been considering contacting Custom Hide about these problems, but I thought I would ask BIFL first to see if I was just being fussy. 

Thanks BIFL! 

Edit 1: Sounds like a lot of people think I should contact Custom Hide to see how they will respond to these issues. I suppose that's a good idea that may benefit me directly and let you all know how iron clad their warranty actually is. I'll shoot them an E-mail tomorrow. 

Edit 2: E-mail has been sent to Custom Hide. I've included a link to this post. I'll let you guys know what their response is. 

Final Edit: As I expected, Custom Hide responded quickly offering to have ""All problems and concerns"" resolved. In particular they mentioned that the scratches in the brass may have been the result of a defective ""hasp."" They also expressly addressed the length of the carry strap. They did not, however, mention the ripping leather or glue. I think the ripping leather was a minor mistake that is easily resolved, but that those who purchase Custom Hide should expect some of the leather to be bonded to the case with glue. I do not consider this a total deal breaker because of their customer service and the places where glue is used...however it certainly reduces the amount of BIFLness that can be claimed for these bags. I assume the brass fastener that is not full secured is a quick fix for them and not worth mentioning. 

At the end of the day this quote is what makes me stick with Custom Hide: ""If you ever have any issues with your briefcase you would just need to let us know. When we say Lifetime Warranty, we mean it, and, our reputation, as well as your satisfaction is our main priority.""

I hope this review serves others looking for a bag. I would still highly recommend this bag to anyone as even the best products have imperfections, its often how the company handles small imperfections that become big ones that makes the difference. I'll be posting further highly critical reviews of items frequently referred to as BIFL that I actually own."	t5_2ss1q	True

Corningware is a company built on a material called Pyroceram.  This is a white glass that is nearly indestructible and is excellent for cooking.  The souffle dishes and casserole dishes that your parents got as wedding presents, and they still use today, are probably made of the stuff.

Then the company got bought out by another company called World Kitchens Incorporated, who promptly discontinued they Pyroceramic stuff.  In 2001 they ""re-launched"" the Corningware brand, but the stuff was made of a different material that is cheap and breaks easily.  When you see Corningware in any store, it's cheap garbage.  I have owned some of it, and it chips and cracks extremely easily.    [Read the reviews of this product](http://www.amazon.com/CorningWare-6109785-French-White-12-Piece/dp/B0000CFOOW) for more information.

BUT, a couple years back, they brought back Pyroceram stuff, but it's sold in very limited quantity, and only on the manufacturer's website.  [Here](http://www.shopworldkitchen.com/corningware/stovetop-just-white-casserole-set-a-423c-jw) is an example.  This stuff is the real deal, and should last forever.

I had them repaired once when the lacing hardware broke, but now the sole bonding is coming apart.  The usual.  Tired of throwing away perfectly good leather just because some glue gave up the ghost I went out in search of repairable boots.  Most of my hiking is done in Chaco sandals (which are repairable), but there are times when I need real boots, and for those I need durable boots.

Store after store I asked if they had any boots with a Norwegian or Goodyear welt that can be resoled.  None.  They'd steer me toward this high end boot or that high end boot, but all with disposable construction.  I finally ordered a pair online from REI.  I ordered the Merrell Wilderness Classics in brown.  Nice looking boots.  Heavy, but wow...  I wore them in the house last night and they're more comfortable than any other boot I've ever purchased.  I intend to take them to my neighborhood cobbler and ask his opinion of their construction and ease of repair -- if he gives them a green light I'll be wearing them for real very soon, otherwise they go back to REI.

So, here's my question... more than one store tried to steer me away from shoes that'll last 20 or more years saying something like ""we know more about foot health now and we know that it's bad for your feet to wear old shoes... they break down and don't support the foot..."" blah, blah...

Is this just marketing?  Is this how the throw-away boot companies justify their cheap construction?  Is there any truth to this?

1328422636.0	pbl03	BIFL: Some thoughts.	pushingHemp	63	9	10	"Just wanted to convey a few thoughts on the subject of owning something for a very long time, for life, or even longer. These ideas have been discovered through reading and experience.

1. Maintenance is king. Everything oxidizes, decomposes, or otherwise wears out. Simple steps can be taken to prolong the life of every product. Follow manuals, do research, and don't slack. Even the best products will deteriorate quickly if not maintained properly.

2. Keep steel oiled or painted. Use cooking oil on kitchen utensils. Aluminum forms a tough aluminum oxide layer that provides protection. Keep moving parts well oiled. Some parts have grease fittings or small holes for injecting grease/lubrication. Use silicone spray on plastic parts. Metal has more flexible options. Wash your car. It's is more important than you might think. Change oil regularly.

3. Clothes will fade in the sunlight so don't store them in the car or directly in sunlight. Leather should be moisturized- it's skin. Keep shoes polished and protected (silicone, beeswax, etc). Assign clothes for different tasks (work, leisure, play) as this can keep clothes that are more reusable in good condition. Replace buttons. Fix seams when possible. Some shoes can have their soles replaced. USE LESS SOAP WHEN WASHING.

4. Keep water away from most items. Or more appropriately, keep them at the correct moisture content. Keep items clean.

5. Obviously, shop for quality. Understand that some countries have higher standards than others. USA might not necessarily indicate quality these days. Japan, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland generally have high standards. Italy is a country generally associated with quality, but I can't say that this is 100% consistent. Generally, Italian products carry higher price tags simply because it seems exotic. It's ""art"" in their minds. Not to say they aren't good, just something to consider. Most Chinese manufacturing is poor, but let's be realistic; China can produce some quality products. It really is hit or miss, but they are a developing country that is improving it's technology.

6. EBAY! Honestly, standards used to be higher. After the concept of ""planned obsolescence"" was introduced, standards dropped drastically. Old hand tools are much better than current ones and last a lifetime. If you need to drill a hundred 4 inch deep holes into hardwood, a power tool will be a better fit, but for minor projects, hand tools are quiet, clean, and will literally last a lifetime or longer.

7. Don't be afraid of artisanal products. Generally, small businesses are more willing to work out problems. They usually take more pride in their work and are worth taking the gamble most of the time. It also helps the economy no matter what country you are in. (see number 8)

8. RESEARCH! Yes, it is easy enough to just post all over the place asking questions, but Google is your friend. Look for reviews from actual long time owners. Read poor reviews first. Analyze the percentage of poor reviews. Learn how to read poor reviews. Many of them just complain about the service of the vendor or shipping times. Amazon is a good starting point, but branching out into forums is where it's really at. Search for sites specific to the type of product you're looking for.

9. Do it yourself. Seriously. When you learn how to produce your own objects, they become so much more personal. You understand how they work, what could go wrong, and how to fix them. You also care about the product more so than if it were bought. It has a sentimental value and you are more likely to fix it. This one has it's limits, but you would seriously be surprised at the number of products that can be made relatively easily by individuals. Even ""industrial items"" such as computers, furniture, and even cars. Takes a little knowledge and skill, but so worth it. Reading the right books allows you to accomplish anything. The internet increases available information exponentially. Might even earn you some money in the long run.

10. Modify. Adding features and fixing flaws can change the game completely. Cast iron pans are sold with very rough surfaces. They can easily be sanded down and made into a MUCH better product. This is a simple example. If you wanted to take it farther, you could increase wire gauges, custom fit handles, replace parts, etc. This one takes a little creativity, but again, an extremely valuable skill.

11. Pay attention to materials. It might say stainless, but there are many grades of stainless. Know the different grades of plastics, metal alloys, leather grades, glass types, etc. Plastic is used in many places it shouldn't be, but there are plenty of applications where it might actually be a better option. Different metals, plastics, and wood all have different maintenance requirements. Is it recyclable? Reusable? I understand this is related to ""maintenance"", but it's worth noting.

12. Keep it simple (KISS). The more shit you have, the more shit you have to maintain. Keep what you need, forget the rest. It makes keeping what you do need a little easier.

I am a 200 pound, male, general contractor with wider than average feet who does mostly small home renovations.  However, roofing, demolition, ditch digging, and concrete work are a part of my job.  I'd also like to use the same boots on short day hikes and geocaching trips.   Any time I see someone mention Red Wings they never go into any detail about the model they own, or what they use them for.  So I'm asking...

-What model of Red Wing boots have you owned that you have had success with?  And what model have you had that didn't wok out?

-When do you where them, and how confident are you in them?


Some of the models I was looking at have recraftable soles (when they wear out you can replace them).  I like this idea, but does anyone know if Red Wing will replace the sole with a different tread pattern?  The soles on most of the boots I like are the white wedge style, but I've heard that they wear out quickly.  Can they be replaced with a tougher, more aggressive Vibram sole?

1353420216.0	13ibnz	[BIFL] Water supply valves	vacuous_comment	76	28	26	"We bought a house 10 years ago. The previous owner had done a superficial restoration and all the parts were Home Depot crap.

We are slowly going through and doing things right, including the plumbing. The kitchen faucet he put in was garbage and needed to be warranty returned once a year (I may put this in another post some time). Hence I was always fiddling with the hookups and supply valves.

Unfortunately all the water supply valves were annoying little multiturn things of horrible quality from Home Depot. Some leak slightly, they have plastic parts in them and I do not like the multiturn style. The little escutcheons around the supply side were all cheap as a crap and rusting away, even though not very old.

I looked into it and settled somewhat arbitrarily on [Dahl mini-ball]( http://www.dahlvalve.com/technical/mini_ball.aspx) style as my replacements. They seem good and may be some part of Grohe.
With Dahl you spec out what combination of features you want on which body, I bought enough for the whole house.


Features I like in a valve: 

* Not crap
* 90 degree style, means very fast to turn on and off
* Colour coded hot and cold
* Visually obvious from a distance whether on or off


[Here](http://i.imgur.com/xLdZk.jpg) is a picture of a couple installed.   Note we have not cleaned up the bathtub yet.  The plumbing was so bad (bad faucet, bad supply lines, bad supply adaptors) it needed attention before I had the time to do the tub. 

Anybody else got household plumbing BIFL tips?

1326071130.0	o8m7p	Saddleback Leather Classic Medium Waterbag	indiomuerto	81	29	16	"I broke open the piggy bank, and pulled the trigger on a new [Saddleback Leather Classic Waterbag in chestnut](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Classic-Waterbag.html?sc=8&amp;category=1289).  I'd been looking to replace a black Jandd Ram carry-on that I bought a decade ago.  I wanted something that could:



* Fit carry-on size maximums for international travel.
* Be rugged enough to check, and not worry about whether my clothing would end up all over the tarmac.
* Not show dirt like a lot of fabrics do.
* Last at least 10 years without becoming tattered/zippers breaking.
* Fit a week's worth of casual clothing/personal effects.

I'm not a big fan of the run-of-the-mill Tumi clones, so I didn't bother looking at those.  I looked at some of small quality duffel bags (e.g. Filson) but I don't really like the way that most of those bags open up: you access everything by the slot provided by one zipper.

Saddleback posted some videos describing the features, and showing the different configurations:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvfNSY8EO7c

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EcsTwyTy6k

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7bl1MII5NM

The only negatives I came across were the price and the weight of the leather.  At $645, this is (obviously) not a cheap bag.  At more than three-times the price of a quality bag, it's not even close to cheap.  The leather is full-grain, and fairly thick, so it's not light like some of the synthetic bags you can buy.

What I didn't find much reference to was the capability of the bag (e.g. how does it handle when loaded up), or to the fit and finish/details of the bag.  I decided to order it anyway, trusting in the return policy of Saddleback.

When it showed up, I took some pictures of the bag, and [what it came with](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#0).  [Everything included](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#1) is of extremely high quality.  The pig-skin insert concept works well.  The [leather on the inserts](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#2) looks like it could take a beating and getting anything on it (e.g. toothpaste) wouldn't be a problem.

The [stitching](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#3) and [details](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#4) of the bags construction seem to be of extremely high quality.  I can't imagine breaking this thing without actively trying to destroy it.

The next thing I did was try to load it down to maximum, while still meeting carry-on dimensions.  I managed to fit:

* Pair of dress shoes.
* Several belts
* 5 T-Shirts
* 2 Dress Shirts 
* 6 Boxers
* 6 Pairs of Socks
* 5 Pairs of Pants (including some bulky jeans).
* 2 Flannel Long-Sleeved Shirts
* 1 Outdoor Jacket
* 1 Sport Jacket
* Dopp Kit/Toiletries

Basically what you'd need for a week long informal business trip in the winter.  The leather cinches/folding works well.  It held all of this without stress, and while still being small enough to carry on a plane.  I tried walking around with it for a while, and the weight of the leather was not excessive.  I also tried out the back-pack configuration, to see how well it works.  It's obviously not the usual mode you'd carry the bag, and you look like a hunchback while doing it, but in a pinch (like when running through an airport to make a plane) I could see it working well.  

**Pros**

Great construction.
Looks fantastic.
Easy to access the contents.
Easy to reconfigure for different uses.

**Cons**

Expensive.
Expensive.
The leather isn't exactly light weight.

If you'd like any more pictures of specific features, or more information on the bag, I'll see what I can put up.

I've been buying the $10 junky ones at Target and such for about five years now, and I get maybe six months out of them, if I'm lucky.

I've been buying ""expensive"" shoes for a while now (three pairs in the past nine or ten years), and I will never go back.  Will probably investigate slippers at those places, but I thought I would ask Reddit for its wisdom, first.


**EDIT**:  So, I thought I'd qualify, without discounting some of the obviously excellent suggestions (at least in as much as you can believe internet reviews), that I'm not a big fan of ""fuzzy slippers"" and that I'm not one to really get COLD-cold (I live in Maryland, USA, so the weather is relatively mild... plus, I'm a fat bastard with one of those ""perpetual furnace"" type metabolisms).  I think that, so far, the Mocs, a couple of the L.L. Bean suggestions, and those DC Villains are the ones toward which I'm gravitating at the moment.  

I'm super-chuffed that there are so many folk who wear slippers!  I was expecting dead air (also, grandpa), but it's obvious that the shoe-that-isn't is still a popular and necessary thing for some of the more refined humans.  Thanks, errybuddy.


**UPDATE (2013-03-18)**:  So, I bought a pair of black DC Villains.  Despite my ""brand hesitation"" (I don't like symbols - flags, logos, etc. - so a recognizable ""brand,"" especially on clothing, is usually a no-go for me), I picked these since they were the cheapest at the moment (got them for $25 after a coupon).  I've already pulled the tag with a seam ripper and ground the plastic logo off of the sole with my dremel.

I'm still looking hard at the Minnetonka moccasins, and now at the ""opera shoes"" recently suggested by NotFreeAdvice.  I'll see how long these last, but they're comfy at least.  Not sure they'll hold up (they remind me of my Rockports - also a ""sale"" buy), but we'll see.

Im a geologist who does environmental field work and loves to hike and fish. Needless to say, I spend a lot of time tearing up pants.

I've been wearing carhartts for a few years and while they are decent, they wear out quickly and are quite wide-legged, not that fashion is a concern, they just have no taper to them.


I know filson have some interesting options and Duluth has their fire hose pants. Are there any other options out there for sheer beat-to-hell durability? They get bonus points if they look ok in public too, and come in a color that isn't standard-field-pants-tan. I have like 5 pairs in this same brown/tan color. Would love to diversify.




Not looking for winter pants, and need to be able to wash them due to my industry (lead dust or gasoline all over me needs to be washed out), however the tin cloth pants really intrigue me.

We are getting married in August. It's very exciting, but I have no idea what to ask for as gifts. Figured you guys might have some ideas! 

Firstly, we really don't want for anything. We are planning on spending the next 5 years or so travelling around the planet. We're aiming for a nomadic lifestyle without any real earthly attachments, I want everything I care about to fit in my duffel bag. This makes the usual suggestions of knifes and cast iron cooking utensils inappropriate, we will have to get rid of them within a year. 

We both already have great luggage so that's taken care of. I have a few pairs of top quality shoes, she could probably use something like that. We have a good slr camera although we aren't much in to photography so I doubt lenses would get much use. 

At this stage, I have flat out told my family that we don't want anything, and they completely understand (I'm sure they'll either get me gag gifts or money). The Bride's family are a little more traditional though. They have said that they'll be buying us something and to really think about what we want. They said that they'd be happy to store it for us until we settle down, which suggests they don't really understand the point of not owning anything. 

At this point I'm tempted to let them buy us whatever and store it forever, or maybe pick it up if we happen to settle down on the same side of the planet as them (VERY unlikely). I wouldn't consider it ours. The other option is to ask for something with a high resale value and just discretely get rid of it... But I suspect they'll find out. 

So I've come to you fine people to see if I've overlooked something! Something that wouldn't be a waste of space in my luggage, something valuable enough to ask for as a wedding gift, and of course, something that will last forever. Any thoughts? "	t5_2ss1q	True
1369431591.0	1ezvdb	[BIFL Request]: Heavy Duty Dishwashers + kitchenware	Joelo246	63	19	21	"Hey All,

So here's the deal - I live with 5 other people in their 20s and the kitchen often gets wrecked. Dishes either don't get rinsed or are really dried out by the time they make it to the dish washer, and a lot of cups come out with grit still on them.

Pans get scratched, our tupperware is a giant confused pile of lost lids, and our knives suck.

I've got a little bit more money this year and I'd like to upgrade some stuff in out kitchen to proof it against a house full of bad habits and poor organization.

The biggest thing I want is a high power dishwasher that will just clean the shit out of anything I put in it so I can just huck my housemates stuff in there whenever it's left in the sink and not worry about it.

But any advice on improving the kitchen would be much appreciated. Keeping in mind nice stuff that requires careful upkeep will probably get ruined, so I'm looking for more midrange stuff that's durable as hell and easy to clean.

One of the things I really like about it is that you can buy [spares for almost every part](http://www.espares.co.uk/parts/vacuum-cleaners/numatic-%28henry%29/henry-hvr200/p/1086/531/0/415502), from the on switch wiring to the entire motor. They have a reputation for being indestructible. The design is really simple, so there's less to go wrong, and these things are battle proven.

A lot of people prefer Dysons, but for me the simplicity and replaceability of Henrys beats Dyson hands down. There are literally shops in my town centre that sell Henry spares.

edit: I have heard that it's not great for really deep pile carpets. We have pretty standard carpets down in our house."	t5_2ss1q	True

Her house has stood up pretty well, built in the early 1970's, but we have been replacing as we go.  Her new project idea is the kitchen, we've already taken out the florescent drop ceiling lights, but the counter is next.  For a high quality, lasting counter, what is the best?

I hate having bags crap out on me every year or so because the handles rip off or the fabric self destructs under the weight of my nursing school books. I was interested in minimalism before this as well so I was really looking to ditch an entire collection of bags for just one durable item. 

I had been researching the saddleback leather bags http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Classic-Briefcase?sc=8&amp;category=83, but at over 700 dollars for something that would suit my needs, that just wasnt going to work. After a lot of research though I found a company that makes a product that is extremely close, so close in fact that a lot of people dislike it because they feel like its a direct ripoff. I would say those people are probably right, but hey, the target audience is different and that is the nature of business sometimes. This is what I went with http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/shopping/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=467

It's a third of the price right now because its on sale, and it is gorgeous in person. It's a beast but it handles all my school crap with pleanty of room to spare for a laptop if I take one (I dont carry one every day) and other stuff I may need to get me through 12 clinical days. http://i.imgur.com/7D4xY.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ZZ4d1.jpg

The construction is solid, the hardware reminds me of horse tack, and I am confident that this will last me a lifetime. Due to the higher quality of leather is this also a piece that can be repaired should something happen to it where as most backpacks are basically disposable once they start breaking down.

Anyways, I just thought I would share, I cant be the only person out there who has a ton of bags who would like to downsize or just have one bag suit their needs hopefully forever. "	t5_2ss1q	True

My two big concerns are professionalism and organization.

Organization's important for me too, as I'm tired of having only two or three sleeves. I'm going to be carrying a bunch of crap back and forth to work and I'd love as many pockets or sleeves as possible for crap (lunch, laptop/tablet, cords, headphones, paperwork, pens, camera, etc.).

I really like the look of Filson or Saddleback stuff and I've been looking at Etsy.

What I'm looking for is a service that gives unlimited space. I have a lot of photos, over 500GB. I'd also like to backup the photos of everyone in my family.

It doesn't need to be a specific photo storage service, but rather file storage.

Key features I'm after:

* Unlimited storage (or really large capacity, at least 1-2TB)
* Guarantee that no data will ever be lost
* Very good chance the service won't be shut down anytime soon
* Multiple users, or access from multiple computers
* Security/privacy - we want to store photos including our children, we don't want them accessible by others inside or outside of the hosting company
* Not too pricey - monthly/annual fee
* It's ok if the storage is split, i.e. unlimited photos files, limited other files

Anyone have any suggestions? 

Yes I could get a portable HDD, but it could crash at anytime and we'd lose all the data. I want to be able to actually safely remove the files from my computer and know they're safe where they are.

I use t-handle hex keys every day to remove socket allen bolts that have not been moved in 40 years.the nature of most of the applications do not allow me to apply heat at the bolt, or get a good penetrant (Kroil) in there. most of the ancient socket allen bolts have a significant amount of galling/oxidation.etc that usually results in the destruction of the hex when significant force is applied.  I spent many years using bad t-handle hex keys and L-shaped allen wrenches. the cheap keys cam out, and destroy the socket allens, even when they are seated and bottom out in the hex.  worse is the situation where I put a wrench (and an extension) on the hex key and the hex key twists, but the bolt doesnt move.
the standard socket allen wrench has flat sides. the WERA hex-plus hex keys have concave (dished) flats. they DO not cam out. they bite on the edges, not on the flats. once i moved to the wera wrenches(4 years ago), I havent cammed out a single socket allen. the good new is that mcmaster-carr sells the wrenches individually for for only a 3-10 dollars each ($6 for 5mm), so you dont have to buy a whole set. I have yet to twist one or break the t-handle (even after applying an impact wrench and a cut out socket to the t-handle). like all hex wrenches, if you manage to damage the end, you can just cut down the end  1/4"" or so and you have a brand new wrench.
definitely a BIFL tool..

I get to the store and show the manager.  He says ""It's because you tripped.""  I was a bit shocked by his assumption and I said ""No, it's not, but I trip because the layers are coming apart.""  He brings over a new pair of sandals that are all grey (Mine are black with grey straps).  I say ""Those are different.""  He says ""No, they're not.""  I said, ""Yes, they are.""  He says ""Look, they're the same color"" (showing me the straps).  The lady at the register next to him turns to him and says ""They're different, the base is a different color"" (good thing she said something because I thought I was going crazy thinking they were different sandals).  

He says Oh, and then proceeds to tell me they don't have any more of the ones I bought.  I tell him I'll browse for different ones, possibly single layer since I don't want the double layer to come apart again.  He tells me that I can just rubber cement it back together - I say, ""Won't they just come apart again...?""  He says, no they won't (funny, because before he says they come apart if you trip.....apparently if you have Rainbows that are three weeks old and trip, they will fall apart - make sure you don't trip!  and if you rubber cement it back, they won't come apart).

Anyway, I opt for black single layers and have to pay the difference since single is more expensive than double (??).  I tell him I should size down because they seem kind of big he says ""No, these are a large (the broken double layer pair I brought in) so you're a large.""  I say ""Yea but...these seem kind of big.""  (the single layer has a looser fit) Exasperated, he goes to get a medium.  They fit perfect, he says ""Oh you're a medium in this style.""

I paid the difference and got the hell out of there.  I know it's probably an isolated experience and I just had a manager with terrible customer service skills.  But that, combined with the sandals falling apart, I won't be re-buying Rainbows when I need a new pair again.
___________________________________________________________________

I was looking for a new pair of sandals after having to retire my Havaianas after 4 or 5 years.  I wanted a pair that would last longer and read both on here and other sites that Rainbows will last a very long time.  I bought a pair (double layer, supposed to last longer) from the store in NYC not even a month ago and wore it normally, nothing extreme, not even getting it wet...and they're coming apart.  The upper part on both sides have torn into two flaps.  This makes me trip sometimes.  I'm confused because they did not live up to what I've been reading everywhere...I am definitely going to go back to the store this week and see what they have to say about it.  Just wanted to mention it here because it always comes highly recommended...but if they turn out like this after less than a month I'll stick with Havaianas.  It seems like this is an exception though..."	t5_2ss1q	True

The latest incident was yesterday. For the most part, they don't chew on power cords, keyboard cords, etc. But there seems to be something about headphone wires that are attractive to cats.  This didn't use to be a problem with previous cats, so either I was just lucky in my previous choice of feline companionship, or wire insulation tech has changed.

I would really like to not have to put something on the wire of my new headphones (when I get around to buying more).

1361276532.0	18tc1v	[BIFL INFO Request] - what kind of bicycles have lasted you the longest?	ahtopahtel	51	12	78	"Hello everybody,

TL:DR - After 4 years of design and testing, I'm finally ready to start making BIFL bicycles. Please help me make it the best possible.

Backstory: I've been working with bicycles for more than 20 years - I've seen the ones that last 15 years and the ones that last 6 months. For the last 4 years I've been designing and stress testing  different components on my new bicycle and I'm planning on launching it this summer.90% of the components are home made using the best aerospace aluminium/steel available. Everything has been ""overengineered"" to make sure the bicycle stays together for atleast 4-5 years before needing any major repair.

How you guys can help: while I've worked on a huge number of bicycles, I cannot recall what each of their problems have been. If you had an excellent bicycle - please share how long it lasted and what was the first component to give way. Or on the flipside - bought an expensive bike, but needed repair almost a month later.

As the rules say - no untested products. Not advertising, just looking for info to make sure I create the most resilient bicycle on earth :)

EDIT 1 - clarifications
EDIT 2 - I've worked on Soviet Union bicycles which lasted about 20-30 years with a bottom bracket change(and a few innertube changes). I want to replicate the same quality bicycles that last for ages, but are also brought into the 21st century.
The idea is to start with a Single gear city/road bike, then a 3-5 gear leisure bicycle. 

As for some people claiming that all bicycles are BIFL - they most certainly are not. A few examples - GT bicycles's frames used to last 5-7 years. They changed their production plant a few years back and after that several bikes have come to my workshop with cracks. I constantly get supermarket/valuemarket bicycles that are literally falling apart after 2 weeks and needs a derailleur, chain, bottombracket and headset to be changed.
I even managed to break 2 Specialized 4130 steel frames several years back and they were supposed to be ""unbreakable"".
My goal is not to put down any manufacturer or describe problems associated, but to get info on what works and what does not.

As for the production run - I'm planning a production run of about 45-50 bicycles this year and the starting price would be around 400-450 euro's. Some people consider it cheap, others expensive. 

Above all - thank you for your replies, they have been very useful :)"	t5_2ss1q	True

I have seen one made of glas some time ago (so i can see how full the mug is) but can not find it anymore. I use number 4 paper filters and let it drip into two cups.

Might look like a trivial item, but i'm fed up buying a new clear plastic one every few years.

BTW, the Hario #2 made from glas is tiny, so that doesn't work. Also it's bottom isn't transparent. I need a size 4.

Any help in that matter of life and death is greatly apreciated. ;)


EDIT #1: Thanks for all the answers. However, most didn't get the point. Some say i should buy a aeropress. How that is BIFL and solves my pour over problem, i can't see. Other mention some fancy cloth that you keep in a waterbath in the fridge as a filter. How that solves the transparent pour over problem i can't see. Another group recommends ceramic. Wich doesn't solve the problem either. Neither does a french press.

It appears there is no longer any #4 glass filter holder on the market. And that is that. I'll get a fresh melitta clear plastic one, that should do for a few years. Maybe then the ones made from glas are available again.

Thanks to all of you. &lt;3"	t5_2ss1q	True
1358980608.0	175g82	[BI4L Request] Need a suitcase that can withstand my life. 	empirialest	53	13	38	"I just returned from a few months of frequent travel, and my hand-me-down suitcase has officially bit the dust. The extendable handle broke midway through the trip, leaving me hobbling and stooped over to walk with the bag. Various structural features have ripped or come apart. It tends to puff out and become front-heavy, which, with the lack of care of baggage-handlers, leaves it to collapse onto its front and frequently destroy my valuables. I constantly complain that I want to set it on fire, and I think the time has come to put my money where my mouth is. 

So, I'm looking for a new bag. In addition to travel, I also basically live out of a couple of suitcases, so I do need a bag that can withstand heavy use. I have searched /r/buyitforlife for suitcase requests, and I know that Travelpro was a favorite in an older thread. A couple of reviews on Amazon were conflicting about the quality of the Crew series and mentioned that the FlightCrew series was superior. I haven't had much luck finding these bags, however.

As for specifications, it could change a lot with what recommendations are given. I definitely want the spinner style, with four wheels. I am not strong, and I hate lugging around a huge bag. I'm considering purchasing a hard shell case, simply because I do use it quite a bit, and I'm not particularly gentle with my bags. I'd like the bag to be between 25-29"", but if anyone can recommend a soft bag that is 21-25"" and expands considerably, I could make that work as well. Ideally, I'd like to spend no more than $150, but I realize that for quality, I will probably have to invest more than that. 

Any other brands I should look into? Do you have a suitcase that has held up particularly well with frequent use? Should I scrap the BI4L idea on this one, because it will just fall apart or get lost eventually? Any words of wisdom are appreciated!

If budget is your top concern, BI4L is not quite the place for you, there are other subreddits that might be better suited to getting a good deal.  What do you, the citizens of BI4L, think about this?

1346721517.0	zb81f	BIFL (old?) Air Tools.	vacuous_comment	50	13	11	"
Air tools in general can be pretty BIFL compliant and a great investment. If you get the right stuff you can buy  old beat up cheap ones and rebuild them easily. They are inherently tougher and simpler than electric tools.

[This album shows a selection of tools I use.](http://imgur.com/a/FBsQz)

In particular, I bought 3 IR231 impact guns super cheap as part of a lot of other tools.  They were all beat up, having spent 10 or so years in a working repair shop.   I knew previously what I wanted and had been looking for them.  I got a  rebuild kit and built up one of them leaving the others for spares. My local IR dealer tested the torque for me, all good.

This was 10 years ago and I have a lasting high quality tool I know inside and out. Friends come to my house to do their brakes so they can use this and other tools I have, they bring beer in payment and I advise them while quaffing.

Doing the brakes on your own car saves a butt load of cash, is easy enough and made much easier with one of these.

A good medium sized oldish air compressor can have a new motor put on and have the pump rebuilt, should it need that now or ever, making it a real BIFL item. Just watch the rust on the tank, you do not want that exploding. Get a really disgusting oily one and inspect it. If you have a large air tank this can be a power buffer for when your power is out.


The rest of the tools shown in the album:

* The IR261 is good for truck suspensions. I got that (cheap) and mildly used from an IR dealer. Where the IR231 is not enough I bring this out, maybe once a year.

* The IR109XP is the strongest air ratchet on the market. Also tough. I got this cheap and used in a batch, needed nothing.

* The air drill I got cheap from aircraft industry surplus for a specific task a while ago and it is handy in various other roles.

* The IR4429 recip saw I got in order to very carefully remove car exhaust systems. Works great for loads of other stuff also.

* The Chicago Pneumatic die grinder likewise, numerous small grinding tasks.  It is lesser quality than the IR stuff but it was pretty much free and has worked fine for 10 years.

TL:DR Air tools, buy them for life.

1340996750.0	vt3sa	BIFL website aimed at promoting the concept to the masses	aeiowu	55	18	18	"/r/buyitforlife is awesome. It's maybe my favorite subreddit nowadays. Not simply because I can suss out high quality, durable goods here. But because of the change that this can mean for our culture here in the US. Reddit is great but it can only reach so far. The all-text format and the nature of its user interface limit the audience to the savvy. I think we can do a lot better.

We're at a point where consumerism is becoming a parody of itself for a lot of people. Planned obsolescence and the throwaway nature of our capitalism bleeds into so many other aspects of our culture in a negative way. Our food, art, journalism, politics, entertainment, clothes, and even our friendships appear as though they are as fleeting as the day is long.

I think BIFL can be a piece of the change towards a culture that values craftsmanship, repair and hard work. I mean sure, it's just a pair of boots or a really good dutch oven, but the economy has been at a point where if we can prove to people that this is a more economical way of living, real change can happen.

So I'm a graphic designer (specifically, I'm a game developer) and completely capable of pulling this site off with the exception of some of the backend stuff (database, search and etc.) that might be required. I'd love suggestions in how we could make the site best for what we have in mind. But in the end, I'd have final say on design stuff (not a fan of design by committee.)

The idea for the site is that it would be a highly accesible portal that would curate the best object under a set of specific criteria very similar to the criteria posted here in /r/buyitforlife. Everything would have to be hand-picked.

**So why post about it?**
Like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, we'd need to curate these goods. A lot of this is a matter of opinion and while someone might say redwing work boots are the best work boots you can buy, others might point elsewhere with good reason. We'd need to have a group of people with similar goals in mind but specializing in different areas (kitchen, workshop, lawn, automotive, home furnishings, clothing, travel, outdoors, etc.)

There's a lot more to cover, like... what do we stay away from? Where does utility end and fashion start? Is technology worth including?

Ok! So that's my idea. I'm interested in any and all feedback that you guys might have. I'm pretty passionate about the underlying concepts of BIFL and in my wildest fantasies, this kind of thing could inspire people to start new businesses creating better goods, built to last a lifetime.

Apparently, Wayfair, Olejo Stores, and other online shops have been stating the Gold Bond futon frames are made in the USA. According to a comment I found from another user on Olejo Stores, this is not true. They are made in China of ""Siberian oak"" which may indicate that the product was built from illegally logged Siberian/Russian oak trees... which is harming the Siberian tiger populations. How true this all is, I have no idea... but not a risk I want to take.

ANYWAY, I ended up buying a nice Amish built oak frame from a local furniture dealer along with a mattress. Seems like a good investment, supports a local business, and supports craftsmen in the USA... even if you are aware that Amish factories can very well be similar to non-Amish factories in America... it's just that they may use diesel generators for electricity or have a non-Amish person drive vans for them.

-----------------------------------------------

Hello!

I'm currently looking for a futon to use as a simple, versatile sofa in my living room. I've been doing some digging around and want to share what I have found so far and also ask user opinions about them, but am totally open to other products/routes.

I was curious if anyone had any knowledge about the Savannah Full-Size futon frame from the following locations:

http://www.amazon.com/Full-Size-Savannah-Futon-Sofa/dp/B000JK38O6/

http://www.shop4futons.com/savannah-sofa-bed-futon-frame.html

Both seem to be the same dealer. The frame itself is apparently made by KD Frames:

http://kdframes.com/catalog.php5?id=12&amp;cid=4

What I like is the reasonable prices, UPS/FedEx shipping, and that they are made in the USA of local poplar lumber. HOWEVER, I'm not very knowledgeable on wood types. Is poplar a durable wood for this application? The reviews for KD Frames' stuff is pretty good, but I'm skeptical. I'm also worried that the poplar would dent just by looking at it wrong, but that is probably an unreasonable thought... considering all I've been able to find are janka hardness scores for various woods which I'm unable to apply to real-world furniture scenarios:

http://ejmas.com/tin/2009tin/tinart_goldstein_0904.html

An alternative for me would be to spend $250 - $300 for a rubberwood frame from my local futon store, which is the Night and Day Furniture Albany frame: http://www.nightanddayfurniture.com/showroom/continental/albany.html

I was thinking of getting an Otis Haley 110 to go on it, or perhaps a Moonshadow or an inexpensive Walmart no-name (Ameriwood?) with good reviews, albeit possibly fake; who knows:

http://www.otisbed.com/haley_110.php

http://www.otisbed.com/moonshadow.php

http://www.walmart.com/ip/8-Independently-Encased-Coil-Premium-Futon-Mattress-Full-Chocolate-Brown/11600836

I already own a Otis Hayley 150 model, which I love. However, the 150 model isn't designed to bend into a futon frame; for platform beds only.

Thanks for reading this mess, and I appreciate any advice you can offer. I hope my research into who manufactures the poplar frame can benefit someone else, as well."	t5_2ss1q	True

**Why is it BIFL?** Because a car ran it over and it still functions perfectly. When the battery is fully charged, I can charge my cell phone twice, or my kindle once. If I only have an hour or two of good sun, I can still get a solid charge. It can be slow, though, when it's cloudy. But that's any solar charger.

By ""honing steel,"" I'm referring to the more common metal rods that often have small ridges and straighten the blades without removing metal.

I've heard I can use *just* a sharpening steel to maintain my cooking knives, any input on that?

Anyone have a recommendation for a decent sharpening steel?  I prefer the look of the cylindrical ones (rather than wide flat ones), and I want a nice-looking handle (not plastic).  Other than that, I'm looking for something cheap.


Edit: From Wikipedia, here's a description of what I'm talking about - a rod for perfoming light maintenance without the effort and precision normally associated with sharpening.
&gt;The traditional ""honing steel"" is not a hone at all, i.e. its function is to displace rather than to remove metal along the edge. The term ""hone"" is associated with light maintenance performed on a blade without the effort and precision normally associated with sharpening, so the name ""hone"" was loaned. In the 1980s, ceramic abrasives became increasingly popular, and proved an equal, if not superior, method for accomplishing the same daily maintenance tasks; manufacturers replaced steels with ceramic (and later, manufactured diamond abrasive) sharpening ""steels"" that were, in fact, hones."	t5_2ss1q	True

It's still holding up, but I'm not sure how much longer I can trust it to hold together. (My previous backpack ripped apart catastrophically while filled with library books.)

Of course, everyone wants something different when it comes to backpacks, so here are the sorts of features I'd be looking for:

* Large capacity
* Ability to hold a lot of weight without falling apart
* Well-padded laptop compartment
* Reasonable level of water resistance (enough to survive for, say, five minutes in a downpour without leaking)
* Side pockets for potentially-destructive things like water bottles
* Overall functional/conservative appearance

Any thoughts, BI4Lers? LL Bean's [QuadPack](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/62115?feat=62115-CLqv&amp;cat4=506219&amp;parentCategory=&amp;attrValue_1=Black&amp;quantity=1&amp;productId=1021754) seems well-reviewed, and the most common rating tag customers have used for it is ""durable"".


_Edit_: I'll try to respond to suggestions below.

* [Osprey React](http://www.townsandtrails.com/review-osprey-react/): Looks a tad small, and it has no padded laptop sleeve. I back up all sensitive data,sure, but I don't want a bad fall to destroy my laptop.
* [GoRuck](http://www.goruck.com/shop/) brand: No external pouches or pockets for a water bottle.
* [Saddleback Leather Co.](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/categories/84-Leather-Backpacks-SaddleBack-Bags): These are super-heavy and very primitive in design. They obviously aren't designed to carry a laptop. And even if I'm going to pay for quality, I can't justify paying over $500 for a backpack.
* [Targus Groove Laptop Backpack](http://www.targus.com/us/productdetail.aspx?sku=TAA-CVR600) looks pretty nice, though the capacity is a bit small, and the price is suspiciously cheap.
* [Targus Sport Laptop Backpack](http://www.targus.com/us/productdetail.aspx?sku=TSB215) is larger than the Groove and seems better-suited for what I'd use it for. Not sure about long-term durability, though."	t5_2ss1q	True

I bought it first this time of year 8 years ago for my first camping trip. I have used it most for camping and when traveling for at least 4 days. It's been in all sorts of trucks and trailers, all over the ground and has seen many miles and types of gear thrown into it. 

I have the Giant size bag and it's very large; I couldn't imagine the colossal size. I can actually fit in it and probably have it mostly zipped. 

I wouldn't say I ""abused"" this bag, but I've never given it any more care than I would give a grocery bag or a cheap $10 Walmart pack. Despite that, the bag shows no signs of wear. All four of the zippers work very well, even though I've literally stuffed this bag full enough so that nothing else and I can barely zip in the first place. The bag has a fair amount of age and miles on it and I would definitely recommend it as a BIFL duffel bag. "	t5_2ss1q	True

My girlfriend works as a bartender and she went through her most recent pair of non-slip shoes in 6 months, culminating in a hospital visit last night after she slipped and fell while on the job. No major damage, thank goodness, but she has mentioned several times over the past few months how her shoes were sliding around more often and also that they no longer prevented the aches and pains you get being on your feet for 10+ hours in non-supportive shoes. I've done everything I can as far as foot massages and suggesting she get a new pair but buying a new set every few months seems ridiculous, I decided to put it to the internet!

Does anyone out there have any suggestions for a brand of non-slip shoe that will provide good arch support and will last a long time?

My father used to own one that was old as dirt, but all I see in stores are made of thin metal that skew sideways and bend when you step on them and have a plastic valve releaser that wears over time.

([I own this one, but it has both problems mentioned.](http://www.kmart.com/schwinn-foot-pump-with-gauge/p-080W725533110001P?prdNo=2)) It looks like a metal connector, but it's just a thin metal shroud over a plastic bit.

Edit: 

It's for whatever needs pumping, be it a bicycle, basket ball, car tire or whatever else. I plan to keep it in a garage, not out on a trail. I like the foot pump because it's less movement and feel it would be better for a wider range of tasks, such as manually inflating something large that will require a lot of pumps and/or a large amount of force or just having hand free for holding a beer while inflating a raft.

They aren't the smallest headphones in the world, nor the most secure if you are doing strenuous activity.  However, if you want a pair of bluetooth headphones that you can use for general things like cleaning the house, using at your desk at work/around the office, that sort of thing, these are *awesome*.

I got mine I believe in 2008 and they look, feel, and work as well as the day I bought them.  They've been handled roughly, thrown in bags, bent up and squished between things and still are kicking just fine.

I consider them the best tech purchase I ever made since they still work perfectly and I always have a use for them. 

 The internal battery holds a very long charge and you can use them for hours and hours.  The stats say 11 hours of use and 210 standby hours.  I have definitely left them in standby for days by accident then used them for hours more.

I of course would hesitate to put modern electronics into the BIFL category but so far these things have been sitting around my desk and in my bags as my go-to headphone for home and office use since 2008.

They also have a microphone built in for use on the phone.  Since it is a stereo headset I find that this makes for excellent use for long phone calls.  I've made many a business call pacing around my room using these.

I've used them a little for athletic purposes but generally I prefer to use something in-ear for that since I want to completely drown out the outside world when I am working out.

Anyway I thought I would share because for the price and the amount of use I get out of them, it's one of the smartest purchases I've ever made.  As far as I can tell the only negative thing people have to say about them on Amazon relates mostly to the fit, and a little on the audiophile angle, however they are fine for me."	t5_2ss1q	True

I see a guy on our local craigslist selling a ""redneck"" firepit with the bowl made from the end of a 500 lb. propane tank, and legs made from oil field drilling pipe. Presumably  that might last ""for life"" with the heavy gauge steel (1/4""?), but not very portable (125 or 150 lbs, IIRC).

One was filled with warnings about what not to do or one might experience serious injury or death, the other had operation instructions, maintenance pointers, and a full schematic with part numbers. I’ll just say that the lawyers lost a sale on that one.
