As a chemistry student I wanted to dig a little bit more into alchemy for my own personal curiosity but also as a way to reconcile spiritualism with science in my own little mind.

What I discovered was slightly unnerving. sit down kids.

So in the 1500's, [Paracelsus](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Paracelsus.jpg/220px-Paracelsus.jpg) ( a German-Swiss, Renaissance physician, botanist, alchemist, astrologer, and general occultist. ) was up to some very nifty stuff in terms of psychotherapy and new medical practise's alongside creating the field of toxicology.

Following [hermetical philosophy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Caduceus.svg/170px-Caduceus.svg.png) he pioneered the use of chemicals/minerals into remedies.
He firstly defined poison and its interaction with diseases, "" the dosage is the poison"", that's him.
 
He birthed the idea that diseases/illnesses were caused by dis-balances in the body's chemicals/minerals/""poisons"", so you could ""fix"" it by just readjusting the scale. Not having to rely on bleeding or opening windows as the only 2 medical solutions any more.

**==&gt;But onto the crispy stuff...** This medical geniuse's birth name was actually Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus ( He might have given us the word BOMBASTIC, actually though), last name **von Hohenheim** 

The man was an accomplished physician and alchemist, who worked on the idea of a perfect human being for a while. 

And he attempted to create it by combining horse dung and human semen in a little flask and proceeded to heat it for 40 days, after which a little dwarf births in the flask, called  homunculus back then.  Sound familiar?

In fma the [Homunculus](http://25.media.tumblr.com/523418fb652195e192ae6d2dc7501c8c/tumblr_mipgfn160x1rryen0o1_500.png) was created similarly from the blood of hohenheim, in a flask, but is given more power by ingesting philosophers stones,which are life energies of people.
Well in the real world, Paracelsus said the [homunculus](http://www.vgmuseum.com/mrp/multi/Essays/enemies-kev/homunculus.jpg) required 40 days of blood supply ( life energy of humans ) to survive and develop.

**TL'DR** The father of modern medicine attempted to create the actual Dwarf in the flask with horse poop, hohenheim's semen, and blood.

edit+: Both hohenheims were born around 1450-1500s

Using the stone, he cured people of blindness, leprosy, and paralysis. He called them ""miracles"". He used the stone to bypass the laws of equivalent exchange by turning water into wine and making 2 loaves of bread out of one. He was praised and glorified by the ""miracles"". But Nero Caesar saw through the lies. He called out Jesus in front of everyone and proved he was a liar. He was killed by crucifixion. He used the stone one last time to bring himself back to life, but messed up. He lost most of his body in the act. While at the gate, he said that since nobody appreciated the things he did for them through alchemy, no one deserves the power of it. He gave up the entire world's gate in order to bring his body back. But since he gave up the gate, no one could perform alchemy anymore. 

Scholars began to study alchemy during the scientific revolution, but couldn't perform alchemy. Therefore, alchemy became a ""forgotten"" science.

In their chemistry class, he began to discuss alchemy as the first form of chemistry. She told me she's already thinking of everyone's favorite alchemist. But the next part suprised even me. The teacher pulls up the episode of FMA where Ed and Al visited the mining town and turn the coal into gold as an example of what the ancient alchemist's would attempt to do. But the part that shocked me the most is that this guy is like, 10 years older than God, and he's watchin FMA! Thought i should share the awesome story.	t5_2t27s	True

I just wanted to share my story with y'all"	firephones	63	8	16	"This was actually awhile ago, I just kept forgetting to post it. So in October, at the C4 convention he was there. I had the Sacred Star of Milos dvd I was hoping to get signed but I had forgotten it. They only had his schedule for that day posted so we were trying to find out if he would still be doing autographs when we were back the next day. One of the workers directed us to just go speak to his assistant at the table, since they had no line at the time.

We walked up there and asked and when the attendant turned to get the paper with the schedule, he came up to us. I will not tell a lie. I kind of fan girled out and couldn't say a word at first. He asked us if we were getting anything, all I could say is I had a movie but I had forgotten it. I was gripping my girlfriends hand, trying to keep from freaking out. I'm surprised I did not break it.

We weren't buying anything and yet he stood with us for a fifteen minute conversation. He asked us questions, we asked him questions. We talked about some of his work, how he got started in the business and then about my girlfriend, who was in broadcasting school and is hoping to be a voice actor some day. He also asked me if I had the Conqueror of Shambala movie, since I had mentioned I wanted him to sign a movie. I told him no, that I hadn't been able to find it anywhere and at that time i had no credit card so couldn't order it. Finally a bunch of people came up to his line so he let us go, making us promise to be back the next day.

Before we finished at the convention that day, I found a Blu Ray of the Conqueror of Shambala and bought it. Deciding to get both movies signed. The next day when I went up there, I didn't fangirl- just stating that. When he saw us, the first words he said was ""You came back!"" he remembered us, even though this time we were completely dressed up. Then he saw me with two movies and brought up me saying I didn't have the first movie the day before. I told him I had found it at one of the tables and bought it just so i could have both movies signed.

We handed over the money and I got my movies signed, but that wasn't the end. He also gave us one of his posters and signed it without charging us, we gave that to my girlfriend's sister, and then he also did the voice of Ed for the two of us. He whispered them in our ears, each of us got our own lines.

It was amazing. One of the best experiences I have ever had. I never got a Christian line, not even when he knew that the two of us were gay. He was nothing short of amazing to us.

TL;DR: Vic knew that my girlfriend and I were gay and together. He never gave us one christian line. During the weekend of the C4 con, we spent about 25 minutes talking and was nothing short of amazing. He has my love, without a doubt.

* Greed is satisfied with what he had in his life.

I think the content is great, but the page seems really plain.

I see a ton of awesome fanart that has been posted and maybe that can be used as a new banner for the top?  The banner just seems a little dated to me.

My biggest issue is that I absolutely *hate* the image at the bottom right of the sub of Izumi and Olivier.  In no way is it an anti-lesbian thing for me, I just feel that the page that is dedicated to fun FMA stuff is literally making fun of it and it is kind of a bummer for me.

Avatar: TLA subreddit has a really cool insignia in the center of the page that has the 4 elements, so maybe we could do something like a homunculus symbol or the symbol on Ed's jacket?

These are just my ideas and maybe I am in the minority.  But, if we want this sub to gain popularity, I think its image needs to be more appealing since that is the first thing people see.  I wish I was more graphically inclined to supply some concrete options, but I just wanted to throw some suggestions out there.

What do you guys think?

I was super excited. He goes to anicons/ comicons / etc.. and he did/does a bunch of other minor characters in DBZ, naruto, onepiece, etc.. (you can look him up). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Mignogna

If any of you are really into the dub version I can get an autograph. I don't want to be a burden and bring him too many autographs to sign but he told me his brother would do a few. Its free of charge so if you want to send me a FMA dvd/blue ray I'll have it signed for you and send it back (you just pay for the shipping if you are far away. If you are interested PM me and I will give you my address so you can send a DVD or something of FMA.

Please remember nothing big and in bulk (preferably FMA DVD's). the golf lessons I'm taking are 1200.00 bucks and its just a small favor that he offered me. I dont need to make any money off of this so its free, I'm not a super fan of FMA so I thought this sub would like it better and enjoy it more than me. ANYWAYS PM me. have a good one guys.

*EDIT He also did a lot of Star Trek stuff making fan fiction I believe? But really good and professional (got permits to to use actual props from the series.. I'm not into the whole sci-fi scene so that isn't something I'm interested in. Just wanted to throw it out there.

I can honestly say, that FMA:Brotherhood was probably the most amazing anime I ever set my eyes on. How it all worked out in the end, all the characters that I felt so attached too, just everything about it was simply wonderful.

Mind you, I havent watched the movie yet, so I guess Im not all the way done, but pretty much. Now time for some quick questions, so I can clear stuff up. (Spoilers ahead!)

1.) What is the purpose of the Gate of Truth? Obviously, it bears ""the truth"" but Im guessing it also lets an Alchemist use his/hers alchemic abilities, seeing that Ed couldnt use alchemy anymore after he sacrificed his to get Al back.

2.) Does each Alchemist have his/hers own Gate? Considering that Ed destroyed just his own, Im guessing that everyone else can still use Alchemy. 

3.) What did the being inside the Gate mean about the ""two"" sides? Was one like an entrance, and one an exit?

4.) Did the pictures at the end indicate that Mustang went on to become Fuhrer and that Ed and Winry had children together?

and finally,
5.) Your own opinions on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood?

1348789668.0	10lam8	How I reacted to finally watching Brotherhood (kinda long, sorry) (No spoilers)	The_Commander	32	5	10	"I had heard a bit about Fullmetal Alchemist, and I had become really interested in watching it. One day I was surfing netflix, and I came across the original series, so I decided to give it a shot. Now at that time I wasn't aware of Brotherhood, and I had no knowledge of peoples bias towards it over the original series. Even if I had, I probably would've watched the original series first anyways.

So there I was, a few episodes in, and I had fallen in love. There was humor, sadness, amusement; it was a rollercoaster of awesomeness. By then I had done some more research online and I had began to hear more and more about Brotherhood. At first I was interested, I knew eventually I had to see it. Then I started to almost resent people just raving about, and giving no love to the original series I was falling in love with. After a while I had to stop visiting this subreddit all together, because it was just a non-stop mine field of spoilers, and I didn't my opinion of Brotherhood clouded any more. All I knew was that it was awesome, but I didn't want to get too swept up in the hype of it all. I mean, how awesome could it be? surely they couldn't have out done the original series that much, could they?

Fast forward, I finish Fullmetal Alchemist and the following movie, and eagerly waited for my chance to see Brotherhood. Now, I'm kinda wary about just watching things online, so I figured I'd buy it when I had the chance. But whenever I had money the store was sold out, and when I was broke they always seemed to have it. It was taunting me. Finally I gave in, and pulled it up online.

The first few episodes, it followed the same general storyline as the original series, and I remember sitting there almost smugly thinking that it wasnt really any better than original, and people were just crazy. A few more episodes in I started seeing the changes in story, but not only that, I also started seeing the level of character development they had put into Brotherhood that just wasn't there in the original. Their emotions were more intense, and therefore so were mine. I also saw how much more the relationships were built up over time, and I was eager to see how it all turned out.

Finally I was into the meat of the story, far past anything that had been in the original, and my opinion of Brotherhood was that it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. When I reached the finale, and the last of the credits rolled by, I just sat there with a deep sense of completion. The original left me wanting more, but Brotherhood had the right amount of everything, and I just felt ""whole"" at the end. I remember looking down at my DVDs of the original series and thinking that I would never be able to watch it again. I had been so obsessed with Fullmetal Alchemist when I first saw it, and all the times after that, but now that I had finally seen Brotherhood there was no way I could go back to the original.

I'm not sure what else I can say. Do I regret watching the original series? Honestly, no I don't. Would I recommend it to other people, yes I would. Just watch the original first, then Brotherhood. I hope people find this review helpful, and I hope there are other people out there who feel the same way.

* Hoenheim &amp; Father - much more obvious good/evil dualism, as well as physical dualism due to same body split between two

We could examine the strengths of these characters and decide who would overall be the last one standing. It may be a long shot, but I think we as a subreddit need to have more real disscusions then Nina the chimera.

1359347170.0	17esfg	Thoughts on Ed and Greed.	Ternion3	24	4	11	"I was just rewatching FMA and FMA: Brotherhood and something occurred to me. In both series, Ed's first fight with Greed (in The Devil's Nest) seems to be a completely wasted opportunity for the Elrics. Here in front of them is a homunculus who says he'll tell them who to defeat the other homunculi/information on the Philosopher's Stone in return for learning how Ed bonded Al's soul to the suit of armor. This deal would have potentially saved them a lot of time.

 I get that Ed is angered by the kipnapping of Al but Greed and his gang didn't seem like they wanted to hurt either of the Elrics initially. Only when Ed refuses to help them and goes on his rant does any fighting start. It just seems to me that Ed kind of messed things up here. Has anyone else thought something like this?"	t5_2t27s	True

-Mustang staying blind.
 
-Have all of Mustang's crew die, including Hawkeye (and have Roy blame himself)

-Pride having a better death. I see him as the homunculus who loved Father the most (""It's only natural for a son to want to obey his father""), and I would've liked it if Pride died by trying to protect Father.

-The ending to the Xing Clans' troubles. Ling says he will take care of all the other clans when he becomes Emperor, but I find that to be a cheap ending. Maybe it should've ended with a civil-war based around competing possession of Ling's philosopher's stone. 

-I would've liked it if Winry died. I do like Winry as a character, but I think it would have been more dramatic if she died at the end at the hands of Kimblee (retcon him being killed).

Can you guys give me some suggestions?	captaincrawdad	18	1	36	"For a little back story, I used to really be into Anime when I was 11-14 (I'm 23 now).  My favorites back then were Gundam Wing, Cowboy Bebop, and Outlaw Star.  Once the whole Toonami/Adult Swim lineup got pretty weak, I lost all interest in Anime for years and actually got pretty negative toward it.  Then, my friend introduced me to Avatar: The Last Airbender which is currently my second favorite TV series of all time.  I know it isn't Anime, but I was so blown away, its obvious Japanese influences warmed me up to finally watching another Anime series.

After some deliberation, a friend of mine who is an Anime expert suggested Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  Needless to say, I was once again blown away and I now hold it on the same God tier as Avatar.  Its enormous cast of characters are all fantastic, the plot is incredibly gripping, and the dub was insanely well acted.  I only have a few episodes left, and I am already looking to start another Anime to start immediately.

Is there any series that comes close to FMA:B?  I need it to have a really good dub with top notch voice acting, since I am so sensitive to bad voice acting and awkward localization.  I also prefer a more westernized theme like FMA and Bebop (having English speakers say super Japanese names has always sounded ridiculous to me).  Amazing characters are a must.  Do you guys have any series you could suggest?  Thanks!

1332374976.0	r7kol	I take it all back. I was too quick to judge Brotherhood in the middle of the series. I finished it two days ago, and it was amazing, left me longing for much more. (Spoiler-filled)		18	2	4	"[Original bashful thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/FullmetalAlchemist/comments/ql88k/anyone_else_like_the_original_anime_over/)

I'm still a little biased towards the original Anime, but Brotherhood was amazing beyond comprehension. Brotherhood was very fulfilling, and honestly it really built up *after* episode 30. Before that, it was very much breezing through a lot, and expected viewers to have seen the first series or read the manga. It took some of the spot-light away from the Elrics, and the Ishvallan massacare, and rather shared it with the other prolific characters like Mustang, Riza, Hohenheim, and Bradley. I really enjoyed the back stories of these characters. Brotherhood really brought out Arakawa's underlying humor back into the story, as compared to the original series. It wasn't just a constant darkness, but a full spectrum of emotions displayed through out the anime. The introduction of several different characters was also nice, and so was the expansion of the powers of the Homunculi. Last but not least, let's not forget the ending. I was not ready for that/was not expecting that. [Edward Elric giving up his own portal of truth for the body of his brother](/spoiler), I was awe-struck. I had no words. While the ending of the first anime was decent, this was the ultimate expression of sacrifice and the strong bond the Elrics share. 

The thing that bugged me the most was the soundtrack. The first series brought something very beautiful with their music. Every single track for me was memorable, each telling a story of their own. Don't get me wrong, Brotherhood has some great tracks (Lapis Philosophorum, Trisha's Lullaby, Resembool's Lullaby, to name a few). But the main theme, in my opinion was lacking when compared next to *Bratja* from the first series. That song was more than just beautiful, and the amount of plays on my iTunes is a testament to that. Other than that, I really hated the over-the-top humor in some scenes. Brotherhood was very careful with this its use of humor, and maybe I'm biased because I prefer the dark mood, and deathly seriousness of the original FMA. But nose-bleeds, and Ed's over-reaction over the mention of his lack of length in the middle of a very serious battle picked at me like someone scratching a chalk-board with their finger-nails.

All in all, I learned to appreciate Brotherhood as a different story. While the first series and Brotherhood share many characters, and the crux of a story, they are two very different beings. I was quick to judge Brotherhood in the middle of watching it, and I shouldn't have been so bashful. The end was a real treat, and made me miss those two damn brother so much, along with Hohenheim. I don't know, I liked Hohenheim of Light more than Van Hohenheim. Maybe I just like men of tragedy, those who know their future is doomed, and watch it fall apart in front of them. But no worries, I'm happy I got to enjoy these stories in my life-time. I hope to buy all of them really soon and add them to my already large FMA collection. This is something I really want to share with the future generations. "	t5_2t27s	True

Ling Yao is the son of a Xingese Emperor. He is after the Philosopher's Stone so he can bring the gift of immortality to his father so he can succeed the throne. He has 49 other siblings, all members of different clans in Xing.

[Qin Shi Huang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang) was a Chinese Emperor in 221 BC. He has approximately 50 children. In his later years he became desperately afraid of death. He began searching for the fabled ""Elixir of Life"", sending many servants out to find it. He ultimately died from mercury poisoning, from the many ""elixirs"" he took.

So? In FMA world, Ling could very well be the son of Qin Shi Huang, making Xing China. Combine that with the styles of clothing and martial art styles, it becomes more obvious.

1372662363.0	1hewh6	After Binge watching Brotherhood, here is why I think Brotherhood is awesome compared to the first anime.	Guterman50	16	5	18	"I love the first anime and I still do. I was very reluctant to watch Brotherhood because I love the story of the original anime and I never read the manga (I still have not). When I tried to watch it when it was first released I didn't like it because I was so used to the original anime. The chronology of the events and the pacing as well as the more comedic tone of brotherhood really made me dislike it and I never got passed the first couple of episodes.

So after rewatching the original anime all over again for the 5th time I decided to watch Brotherhood for once. The original anime I really liked because the homunculi all had personality and story, the pacing and the stories before the diverging point between the two was excellent in the original, and overall the tone in the first was mostly serious and occasionally really dark (Nina :,( )

But when I finally decided to watch Brotherhood without stopping I realized some things that I should of realized when I first attempted to watch it. This is a different anime with a similar characters but a different story so the chronology of how the events transpire will be different before the diverging point. As well they decided to speed through the story in 12 episodes which took more than twice as much for the original because they didn’t want to repeat some of the stories of the original and they were getting to a much bigger and better story.

After the diverging point I instantly got hooked even more than the original and couldn’t stop watching. This is a list of everything that was amazing in Brotherhood which was not in the original

- All of Mustang’s squad is used more and more integral to story instead of being comedic characters that are just there.
- The edition of the residents of Xing was just awesome. May and Greed-Ling were not only hilarious but awesome.
- Showing more of the world by showing the North and other places made it feel a lot bigger.
- Everyone of Briggs and their soldiers were badass
- The use of all the supporting characters of the show. There were a lot more supporting characters in Brotherhood compared to the original and they were actually used a lot more than the original. There were more fights then the original where the Elric Brothers either had support or were not even in the fight. 
- they actually had a coup that was a gigantic battle. In the original I was disappointed there wasn’t a huge battle of Mustang and allies taking central but in Brotherhood they had exactly what I wanted. A gigantic city fight that actually ended with them taking central command and not just a fake coup that took focus away from Mustang. 
- An actual sense of urgency where the main conflict had to be stopped because it affected the whole entire land instead of just the brothers and some of the side characters. 
- A final epic fight that had most of the characters fighting a big bad and working together to take it down. The first didn’t have that ending fight that I wanted and this reason and the two above made the first anime feel rushed. 
- The ending of Brotherhood had a lot more closure and optimism compared to the first anime. I felt satisfied with the ending instead the first where I wanted more. 
- Finally Winry and Ed actual end up together! I was incredibly mad that the first anime and the movie that acted as more closure ended with Ed not ending up with Winry. When I watched Brotherhood I was so happy that they actually had a relationship.

To finish I like both animes and they both deserved to be watched. They are both incredibly good in their own right. The original is still amazing and part of the TV I grew up on but Brotherhood did everything that I felt was left out of the first anime. After binge watching both all I want is to rewatch because they are amazing!"	t5_2t27s	True

1370149320.0	1fi6uv	I just finished brotherhood and...	Dartht33bagger	24	12	12	"I have to say that I liked the original series more.  Sure, the ending was weak and there were some plot holes, but the story was so much more character driven and dark.  It felt real.  Brotherhood felt like too much action without that much character development.  The overall tone of the show was too light for a country that is about to be turned into a philosophers stone.  Below, I'll just a highlight a few things that I think each show did well.

 Things I liked better about FMA:

* I felt like Scar and Al had better voices.  In brotherhood, I never really felt like Scar's voice was harsh enough for the man Scar was.  Scar's voice in FMA fits the character perfectly in my mind.  As for Al, the female voice actor did a great job with the role in brotherhood, but at times Al's voice did sound like a womans voice (especially when there was a lot of emotion in his voice).  These are minor things, but I thought I'd point them out.

* The art style.  I watched brotherhood right after FMA and I instantly noticed a decrease in the detail of the characters.  While the backgrounds and environments still looked pretty good, the characters just looked cartoony.  FMA's art style made the characters feel real.

* One of my favorite parts about FMA's storyline was that the homunculi came from failed human transmutations.  When the topic was first brought up in the show, I was blown away.  To me, the explanation made perfect sense and gave the homunculi a whole new dimension to their back story.  It also allowed the homunculi to have very interesting emotional interactions with the main characters (sloth with Ed and Al, Lust with Scar, Wrath with Izumi).  

* I really liked Lust in FMA.  Towards the end of the show, I was really hoping that she would have a change of heart and befriend the humans.  I was saddened by the fact that she died right when she was starting to become a ""good guy"" (or girl, I suppose).  Lust dies immediately in Brotherhood, so she almost doesn't exist.

* Scar's final plan was great.  I could have never seen Al turning into a philosophers stone.

What I liked in Brotherhood:

* Mustang was more important in this one.  He played a pivotal role in the story from the middle of the show onward.

* Ed went after Winry.  Why he didn't do it in FMA is beyond me.  

* The names of the homunculi actually make sense in Brotherhood.  In FMA, I could never figure out why the homunculi were named after the seven deadly sins.  I always wondered what would happen if more than 7 homunculi existed at once?  What would the 8th one be called?

* The ending in Brotherhood was much better.  It closed up the story nicely and had an exciting final battle.

Just wanted to get this off my chest while the series was fresh in my mind.

We loved that show, we even sent thank you letters to bones studios, for making such a wonderful show.
We'd always talk about the show even after watching it, how the story was, even fantasized a little. Her favorite character was Winery, and mine was Edward. We loved the relationship between the two, how they both loved each other from the start, they just didn't know until they were put through the trails of getting Alphonse body back. It's hard for me to put into words how much we loved that show...
I just got done watching it over again, both FMA and FMA: Brother hood. Seeing some of our favorite parts almost makes me cry, I missed the show and her so much. I'm not going to go into details about what happened between us, other than that it didn't end very well.

Although Winry might want to use the names of her parents, though I'm not sure they're given in the series.](/b)

Maybe it's because they're similar in a lot of ways and I knew some certain outcomes. But as far as the endings go, brotherhood had the way better and much more satisfying ending imo.

1344183788.0	xpvj5	Why I loved the 2003 series more. (RANT)	BlackLock-	11	2	6	"Ok, so many people bug me about the fact that I love the 2003 series a lot more than Brotherhood. They say ""Oh it's not the original story gsklgnmerewrbnelkjejr"" and slobber their opinion all inside my ears and eyes and shit. So here is why I found the 2003 series to be better. 

1 - Alchemy: In the 2003 series, Alchemy was an exact science. Everything that occurred in regards to Alchemy could be scientifically measured, except for the Gate (but that was the intention anyways). Even then, the Gate could be studied. And while I'm on that subject, I liked the Gate more in the 2003 series. I thought it made more sense. I liked how to create a direct link you took something from one side that wasn't supposed to be there and used it to open the door (like how the Nazi's use Envy and Hohenheim to establish a direct link rather than having to travel through the ""truth""). In Brotherhood, the Alchemy came across as more of a magic than a science. 

2 - On that note, the Philosophers stone. In Brotherhood, the stone is so easy to make and there are so many stones, its ridiculous. It's like, this is a stone that alchemists have been seeking since the birth of the science itself, and here the military is mass-producing it. And seeing as how the object of Ed and Al's search is the stone itself, it seemed pretty stupid to me to make it so easy for them to get. In the 2003 series, the stone was near-impossible to create. And using those pseudo-stones that Marco created or the red water that the Impostor Kids were studying was very dangerous. In Brotherhood, you could make a stone with 10 people. It didn't seem like a big deal. In the 2003 series, well over 10,000 people were the MINIMUM to create a true stone. 

3 - The homunculi were probably one of my biggest reasons. In Brotherhood, they weren't even homunculi! A homunculus is an artificially made human without a soul. The things in brotherhood were just monsters. Please tell me how something that's true form is a ball of black goo or a tiny green lizard is a human? The Homunculi were better characterized in the 2003 series. They weren't just monsters, they were real pseudo-humans, plagued by the memories of who they were supposed to be. It made them tragic, but above all else, it made them *human*. Especially Lust and Sloth. Even the method for creating a Homunculus made sense; a failed human transmutation. Giving them the stones gave them form. And because they came from the Gate, they had super-human abilities. It made sense. And for the most part, they actually lived out their names. Especially the 2003 Sloth, Pride and Envy. Gluttony was the same in both series' (I will point out that the reason Gluttony turned into that monster in the 2003 series movie, was because his body got all mutated from feasting on the stone and then Dante's mangled body). And Lust especially became a tragic figure. Her death was actually sad and powerful. And SPOILER ALERT Envy being the homunculus of Dante and Hohenheim's son made it so damn emotion, especially when it hits you that that is why Envy hates Ed and Al so much; he hates them because his own father abandoned him for those boys. 

4 - Next up is Hughes. I hated the way they dealt with this in Brotherhood. He's only with you for a couple of episodes and then he dies, you just don't form the same emotional attachment to him and his family that you did in the 2003 series. And in Brotherhood, Hughes' death was pointless. He didn't discover anything that wasn't already discovered by either Scar's brother or Isaac the Freezer, and ultimately his only purpose was to die so that it'd give Mustang a reason to go ape shit at Envy and have that stupid moment with Scar, Hawkeye and Ed lecturing him. In the 2003 series, you have the time to form an attachment to Hughes. And on top of all that, his actions are actually important. He was the first to discover the truth about the Fuhrer's secretary and because of his death, the Homunculi had to cover their actions more carefully. Hughes' death made sure that the enemy had to tread on eggshells for the rest of the series. 

5 - Misc. points: I liked how tragic the 2003 series was. How Yoki lost everything and then, when offered a chance to redeem himself (as misguided as it was), he ended up getting killed. I like how Marcoh died, because of the same reason: he tried so hard to do good to balance out all of the evils he did in the past, and instead he ends up handing Ed the secrets of the stone and getting killed. I like how Mustang is the one who killed the Rockbells in the 2003 series, because it adds depth to Mustang's character. His image of the strong, leader slowly dissolves throughout the series to that of a man broken by what he did in his past, trying desperately to become a good, honest person. And it's not like in Brotherhood where he was a soldier who killed enemy soldiers, in the 2003 series, he killed unambiguously good people. In Brotherhood almost everyone ends up with a happy ending and it completely undermines the concept of sacrifice and redemption. The fact that some people get completely shafted by the world like Marcoh, Yoki, and especially Rose who in the 2003 series winds up getting gang-raped by Amestrian soldiers, makes the series all the more tragic and emotionally powerful. 

6 - Ed and Al's maturity. In Brotherhood Edward doesn't really mature. Al does, but not really Ed. in the 2003 series you see Ed progress slowly, starting from an arrogant boy, to a naive child, who's innocence slowly twiddles away, he goes from the boy who cried and freaked out over killing Greed to the man who killed Sloth without even thinking twice while she was wearing the face of his own mother. You end up feeling bad for Edward. You watch the 2003 series thinking ""fuck this kid's gonna need some therapy when all this is over"".  And on the note of Ed and Al, Hohenheim is more of a tragic figure as well. A man scared of death and hopelessly in love with Dante, and when he finally comes to terms with the fact that he's a prick and no amount of good doing will change that, he decides to leave Dante and falls for Trisha. And the fact that Hohenheim gets scared of Trisha finding out his past and runs away makes Hohenheim more realistic. 

7 - Finally, the antagonists. Father, to me, was an idiot, his plan was sloppy irregardless of what Pride says, and he just doesn't seem as powerful as everyone makes him out to be. In the 2003 series, Dante was an incredible villain. A girl who was once innocently in love and perhaps overly ambitious, who fears death. As she grows older she is corrupted by the power of the stone and her mind becomes warped and tainted as she realizes just how many people she's killed, until she becomes so warped that she loses every part of her ""self"" until only the fear of death remains. She is actually so misguided as to believe she is the shepard of humanity. Her opinions and views make her feel more human, especially because she is NOT perfect and certainly not as all powerful as she thinks. 

That's all I can think of for now, AMA fma related and I'll answer.  "	t5_2t27s	True

1336751489.0	tiayo	Recently finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Want suggestions.	mlor	10	1	18	"Disclaimer: I have this posted in /r/anime as well. But I figure there are some people in this subreddit that don't frequent /r/anime that will also have good suggestions.

I recently finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and enjoyed it quite thoroughly. I am looking for some suggestions for what to watch next and will describe below what I have seen and liked so far.


Death Note - The first anime I watched. I was totally blown away. I had never seen anything quite like it before. Kira hunting L. L hunting Kira. It was fascinating to watch. I was on the edge of my seat the entire show.


Ghost in the Shell - I haven't watched the movies, just the show. I love the subject matter: transhumanism.


Fullmeatl Alchemist: Brotherhood - I don't know what it is about this show, but I cared about more characters what happend to them more than any other series I have watched. The story was great. The struggle of the brothers and the relationship that they have is unparalleled. I was very sad to reach the end, but all good things have one.


There are a couple things I have noticed about what I like in an anime:

* I like when the full story arc is out there. Look at the ones I have watched already. All of them are less than 70 episodes. I don't really want to get into a long-running series like Bleach or Naruto.
* I like them to keep, for lack of a better term, ""the craziness"" to a minimum. The I don't know if there is a term for it, but I don't like when they do [things like this](http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/1858/izumi3.gif). It breaks the immersion for me. I think I enjoyed Death Note, GitS, and FMA:B partly because they kept this kind of thing to a minimum
* I watched Death Note originally with an English sub, but usually prefer English dubs. I will watch a sub if the dub is terrible.


Obviously, those are just general guidelines, but it should help narrow down what I would like.

Now I've just found out this Brotherhood has been released and it's not a sequel but an anime that follows the manga, I also read the first few episodes of FMA:B summarise the original FMA until it deviates from the manga. I read a comment saying it's worth watching the original FMA until it deviates from the manga and then continue from somewhere in FMA:B.

I don't remember much of the anime, it was so long ago, so I'd definitely enjoy getting the most I can out of the plot.

So I'm wondering, could someone please tell me what to watch and in what order to get the best experience? Are the movies included?

However, as my friend pointed out (whom got me onto the show) - there is not nearly as much explained in brotherhood. Characters are not as well developed and even some voice actors are different.

Great to see more discussion last week, as the subreddit approaches 3,000 Alchemists (another 1000 after the 2000 milestone last month) we'll hopefully see more activity arrive in our discussion threads. (It was also amusing to see no voting what so ever on the post last week). Kudos to those still participating and keeping it alive!

He was very aptly the moral/spiritual counterpoint for the Dwarf in the Flask (which perversely bore his image). Hohenheim took pains to thread each soul in his Philosopher's Stone; he chased no dreams of glory or power; he settled with a loving family, the likes of which he had never known; he truly cared for his children. The Dwarf in the Flask was essentially Bizarro Hohenheim, a slave of its own insatiable condition (which likewise made it appealing and tragic in its own way).

Second time around, I much more appreciated Scar's brother. He cracked the truth long before everyone else and formulated a counter-strategy that saved the whole day long after his (heroic) death (saving Scar). He was cool.

Each character drew me for some reason or another. Whew, the different homunculi and their thematic deaths; all the protagonists and their loyalty and sacrifice; Alphonse and his precocious maturity; Edward and his humility. I could go on and on. But I'd love to hear yours!

Such an awesome story, fantastic fights, and what a good conclusion! The story oozed emotion out of every pore, from Ed and Al's journey to get their bodies back, to Mustang and co. dealing with the corrupt government, to Father and his plan to take over the world, you *felt* for these characters, you were emotionally invested in their well-being. Hell, I bet most of you even felt *bad* for Envy when he finally died! I think the moment I realized FMA:B was going to through me for many a loop was seeing King Bradley's initial battle with Greed (season 1 finale). You go from having almost no knowledge of this seemingly kind ruler, to realizing how malicious and brutal he actually was. 

My question pertains to the ending, namely Ed's sacrifice to bring back Al. I understand what he gave up to bring him back was his ability to transmute and perform alchemy, but my question is with Al going East and Ed going West, does this mean there is a possibility for Edward to somehow regain his ability to transmute? Or was he simply going to the West to help people as he'd been helped himself (I understand that that is the basic concept of the Elric brother's new philosophy)?

I only finished the series 10 minutes ago and I have to say the ending is a lot to take it. It's sorta bittersweet if you get, me, but I'm sure you all know about that anyway.

Firstly, I remember reading on a thread on /r/gameofthrones that the directors might be deviating from the books slightly in how they'll make the show, and someone said that FMA deviated from the manga  in it's ending. So my question is, how did the manga end? I didn't want to look it up because I saw that FMA Brotherhood is a manga continuation or something like that.

My other question relates to FMA Brotherhood. Just what exactly is it? Is it a continuation of some sort? I probably should watch it, but some screenshots, or small little spoilers of it are confusing me. I'm not entirely sure if it is a continuation, or if it's a ""what if"" kinda spin off since I've seen [Al back in his armor and ed is obviously with him.](/o)

Why am I asking where to begin? Well, I'm a little confused. I recall friend of mine telling me that there were different versions of the anime or something. Like how FMA: Brotherhood was more like the manga(as in, what Dragon Ball Kai did with the series or what?). I may be really wrong, but that's why I'm asking. It was a long time ago and I'm not really sure if I got it correctly.

As we all know, Dr. Marcoh is [involved with making philosopher's stones.  I was wondering why creating philosopher's stones is not considered a form of human transmutation.  Why is Dr. Marcoh not eligible to be a human sacrifice/did not see the gate though it seems as though making philosopher's stones is a form of human transmutation?](/b)

On the other hand, Hohenheim [was involved in what was essentially creating a giant philosopher's stone out of his own body, and that was considered human transmutation/led him to the gate.  Also, technically, it never mentions that Dr. Marcoh did not see the gate.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to see if anyone has a clear reason for this.](/b)

Remember, being enjoyable and feel-good might not necessarily mean it was objectively better done. My opinion is I am torn between the two. Brotherhood has a better story, the original tells it better. Brotherhood has a perfectly tied up ending and a great climax, but skims over a lot of stuff earlier on without explaining or adding significance. The original has a great buildup and fully fleshed out sidestories, but the ending is incomplete and unfulfilling, and the climax anti-climactic. Or so I feel. What do you think?

I was wondering mostly about Wrath's place in the whole overarching story. From the beginning he seems like a really funny/trollish leader who turns out to be a conflicted bad guy thrust into carrying out his creator's plan for the world. As the show went on I was certain he would somehow end up betraying his ""Father"" and choosing to spend life with his wife. Obviously that's not what happened as he completely went berserk against any humans opposite him. He died with an extreme distaste towards humans in every way. Basically I was very surprised and just wondered what other people thought of him. I just assumed the wrath that was injected into him was what got the better of him in the end.

The only thing I wasn't so sure about Lust was basically that she didn't seem to have a lust for anything. Obviously she wasn't around for long, but even Sloth had a more obvious desire to be lazy than she had lust for something.

Basically looking back I can really only see Wrath as a super tragic villain and Lust not really having any importance(despite having a crazy death scene from Mustang lol). Just wondering what other people thought about them."	t5_2t27s	True

1325821847.0	o4y0n	How to watch the two anime versions with good pacing	raficus	6	1	7	"*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was sort of a fan service, and its initial pacing seemed to assume you'd already seen the first anime.  For newcomers to the later series, I think the first part is a bit overwhelming, breezing through plot points without gradual character introduction/development (one of the merits of the original).*

A while ago, I thought of ways to ""converge"" the two versions, in which one would digest the first part of the original series, then start watching from a later point in the second series. This is what I finally decided upon:

* Watch the 2003 anime through episode 17 *(visiting Resembool)*, skipping 4, 10, 11, &amp; 12 *(filler)*.
* Watch the 2009 anime, starting with episode 7 *(looking for Marcoh's notes)*.

**What do you guys think?**

I know next to nothing about it, but a lot of friends whose opinions I respected enjoyed it, so I'll take the plunge.

...however, I don't know those friends anymore. So I have NOBODY to help me navigate, and it turns out this series needs it more than most. I've read up about the two different series, and understand how the original is generally considered inferior (but still worth watching) compared to the manga-accurate Brotherhood.

That is the sum of my knowledge. I don't know if dub or sub is generally recommended (I *usually* watch sub, but am flexible), or what's going on with how one or both series has movies, etc. Is there a link anywhere to a ""how to watch FMA"" guide, or does anyone have recommendations for a new watcher?

Anything like a ""Watch them in this order, and don't miss out on XYZ movies"" would be helpful. I wouldn't call myself an experienced anime nerd, so this kind of thing intimidates me and is a big part of why I haven't watched the series yet. But I usually DO enjoy anime when I do manage to watch it, so I don't want to miss out.

1344264796.0	xrmx1	Should I read the manga or watch the anime?	Dan479	4	1	3	"A few years ago a classmate recommended the manga, so I bought it in a bookstore and followed up by purchasing two more afterwards. However, after those three books I lost interest. Now I've regained it, and I wonder if I should read the webmanga or watch the anime. 

I was in a similar situation with One piece half a year ago. Though I quit that much further in. Had read the manga until I quit. One day I was home and sick and began watching the anime from where I quit, and when I reached the latest anime episode I began reading the webmanga, where I realized and remembered that the pacing was far superior and the humor was better pulled off. 

So my question essentially is - Is this a similar situation that the manga is superior to the anime many aspects? 

EDIT: So by reading around a bit I have discovered there's major differences in story between the anime and manga, unlike other series I've read/watched. Does this mean that if I like FMA I should do both? And if so, when does the story splits happen?"	t5_2t27s	True

I thought Ed and Al leaving everyone behind was sad, but I can see that as something they would do. Also, how did the evil woman immediately be able to perform alchemy upon entering their world? I know that she studied beforehand on the chance that the world was real, but do you really think that she would suddenly be able to know how to manipulate the materials around her? And create transmutation circles in thin air?! I found it incongruous to the limitations previously set in place.  However, I thought that the Wrath and Gluttony fight was AMAZING! But the character development and plot were very poor in my opinion, and I was a bit heartbroken as I am madly in love with the original series (haven't watched brotherhood yet - I'm getting to it) and I found this ending to be poorly thought out and silly.
