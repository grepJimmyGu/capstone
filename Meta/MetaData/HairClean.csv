- mix a half an avacado, 1 tbs coconut milk, honey, and olive oil (not overnight smells terrible in the morning)
- vitamin b, and biotin supplements also taking a multi vitamin helps with everything
- massage your scalp a lot helps blood flow which helps hair growth
- brush it upside down just as long ad you can get the natural oils from your scalp and roots to the ends.
- don't brush or comb it when it's wet
- don't cut it
- if you really want, I've never used them, but there are shampoos such as Nissm ""fast"" that helps your hair grow faster
- DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENTS
- don't be really rough when towel drying, avoid it as much as possible
- don't sleep with your hair loose. Braid it put it in a ponytail or something to reduce breakage (re recommend two braids on either side)

Please feel free to ask question.

So what do you girls do to maintain your long hair. Do you just leave it like that to grow without doing anything to it or styling it..just the way you were born with it or what?

While I did get some help to cover the costs of his initial appointment with the vets, he is now in much deeper need of veterinary care, and of course, I am not going to get given that money for nothing - So I am selling my hair! I do not keep any electronics (the computer I'm using is my friends and I go between the library, too) so this is really my last option to help my little guy. We are in need of around £500 but I know my hair will not go for that so the asking price is £350 or offers.

LISTING DESCRIPTION:

FOR SALE:

10-12'' of thick virgin hair in dark brown.
I have been trying to grow my hair out for the past 2 years and so have avoided heat appliances at all costs meaning my hair is in top condition.

Washed every 3-4 days.

Never dyed.

Slight red tinge in the light with faint but natural ombre ends. Gradually fades into a lighter brown which is more noticeable in sunlight.

Hair will be cut by professional hairdresser and sent 1st class recorded.

Please email me if you have any questions.

Selling to fund cats veterinary treatment.

SERIOUS OFFERS ONLY.

I always wanted to do something a bit crazy since I've always had conservative dirty blonde hair. I let it grow out so it was completely virgin, and cut it to my shoulders. I then bleached it out white... a very scary and painful process... and then added pink! I wanted a pastel/pale pink that was sort of mermaid, my little pony, Marie Antoinette, esque.

What do you think? It took me a few days to get used to but now I'm loving it!!

Geecy	16	0	35	"For context, I'm 5'11, 200lbs, and pretty big boned with thick, wavy and frizzy natural hair that's prone to damage by straightening. I've already cut several inches off and am still not really happy.

I'm nervous to go extremely short because I feel like it might make me look too butch or like I have too small of a head, but I'm a really busy college student and I'm so exhausted with dealing with my hair every day and I'm sick of my natural hair texture not behaving. I've gotten a lot of A-line suggestions, but I'm pretty sure I'd have to straighten that and I don't want to take the time or risk damaging my hair more than I have. Any low-maintenance ideas?

1374534034.0	1iugtv	Help: Current pixie cut; friend and bride-to-be wants me to grow it out in 3 months	beanieb	18	3	24	"Hey /r/hair!

Here's my predicament in short (pun intended). I currently have a pretty short pixie cut. [This picture](http://imgur.com/28zyqLI) is from 4th of July, and [here](http://imgur.com/fo3bHdE) is a not-so-flattering picture from a camping trip this weekend. Today, I got an email from a friend whose wedding I will be in on October 19th asking me if I wouldn't mind foregoing cutting my hair until the wedding so that I could attempt to get some kind of up-do. [These](http://imgur.com/a/yCW4r) are the examples she gave me on what she would like for my hair to look like for the wedding. I'm currently training for a marathon, so ideally I'd like to keep my hair short (because running in the southeast is hot as all get out), but at the same time, I want to be able to give her the wedding she envisions.

My questions are: 

1. How realistic is it to assume that in 3 months my hair could get long enough to be able to put up? 

2. Are hair extensions an acceptable alternative? Can you do temporary (clip on) extensions with a pixie, and would it look okay, or really awful? 

3. If extensions aren't doable, and my hair likely won't grow out...what are some formal hair styles for longer pixie cuts that might be a good compromise? 

EDIT: So, I emailed the bride-to-be telling her I didn't think that my hair would grow out long enough to do that in time. She said that she'd rather me not do extensions as she wants it to look natural, but is open to the idea of headbands! I'll try to get it a bit longer before the wedding so there's a little more to work with, but she took it very well. I'm also going to forward some of your suggestions to see if she likes any of those styles to make her feel a bit better about them. Thank you all so much for the support and encouragement!"	t5_2qmsf	True

1368661430.0	1ef0zj	Dying my hair from dark red to light blonde at home (results and how I did it)	BamBam34186	15	1	4	"A few months ago, I chopped off all my hair and decided to dye my hair a dark red. It was all great for the first few weeks and then I began to hate it. As many of you know, red fades really quick so my pretty red tones were fading to icky brassy colors. Hated it. So, I decided that I wanted to go blonde.

Anyone who has had red hair knows that, although it is the quickest to fade, it is the HARDEST to actually get out of your hair. Weird how that works out, huh?

[LET MY JUST STATE HERE: I hadn't dyed my hair in over a year prior to going red so my hair was very healthy starting out. I managed to keep it that way by doing deep conditioning treatments between processes.

Anyway, here is my hair before: 

http://i.imgur.com/UENbkAv.jpg

First, I bleached my hair. All of it. (Well, not technically bleach but basically the same thing. I used Loreal Paris haircolor remover that I got at Walmart] My head was wrapped with cling wrap, as well.  I left it on for about forty five minutes and it made my roots ultra yellow blonde and the rest of my hair a red-orange color. 

The next morning, I took a trip to Sally's and bought Prism Lites Violet. ( http://i.imgur.com/yBv7HXS.jpg ) I used the Ion 40 developer and bleached everything but my roots. After wrapping my head in cling wrap, I left that on for about forty five minutes as well. 

When that was finished, my hair was still a bit orange so I attempted to dye it with Ion Color Brilliance permanent hairdye in ""High Lift Cool Blonde"" I used 30 developer from Ion and let that set for an hour. By now my scalp is pretty hot!

This is how my hair looked after: 

http://i.imgur.com/qBDlYEo.jpg

Still pretty orange, but the red is all gone. The last thing I did, besides conditioning the hell out of my head, was use toner.

I bought Wella Color Charm Toner in T14 (pale ash blonde) and mixed it with 30 developer. I left that on for fifteen to twenty minutes before hopping in the shower. I scrubbed my head with John Frieda Frizz Ease shampoo before letting my hair soak in an Ion conditioning cream for about five or ten minutes.

Surprisingly, I didn't lose any hair. I combed my hair after each shower and had only one or two strands on my brush...which is normal. I am going to continue conditioning it but I've also made my own purple conditioner by mixing a moisturizing conditioner with a dab of Purple Manic Panic hair dye.

This is my end result:


http://i.imgur.com/hU3TrtU.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/IkqaQKH.jpg



I'm very pleased with the results, even if I had to process my hair a ton of times!

(And if anyone is interested, I used Price Chopper's store brand of Jolen facial hair bleach to lighten my brows. I already fill them in with brow makeup. But I wanted them lighter so I could fill them in with a more blonde color)

So I did genius things and put castor oil on my scalp and coconut oil on my tips... slept in it (in a bun, outta my face)... then did the following to wash it out: put shampoo in it before you put water in your hair, then add a tiny bit of water to lather it up, then actually add regular ammts of water, lather really well and rinse it out... Since it still felt a little oily, I did another quick shampoo. Then I conditioned per usual and put a little morroccan oil in while it was still wet.. 

I know this SOUNDS like a lot of work hahah but its really not! And I am BLOWN AWAY by the results... My hair took half the time to blow dry and is like silk! It feels super strong, is super shiny, and smells really nice. 

I'll probably do this only once a week (plus I only heat style once a week) so fingers crossed it helps with the grow out process.

For reference: my hair had been bleached and dyed blue last year, but I've been coloring it black (natural brunette)... so it was definitely not in the best shape.. Now I'm just trimming it and letting it grow.. My hair is sorta fine, but I have a lot of it.

The wedding is tomorrow morning and I'm just wondering if there's a home fix I can do to try and lighten the colour or remove the purpley tones? Or am I going to have to just grin and bear it?

I have shoulder-long, very straight and very shiny hair. From the top of my head and about 10 cm down, it is ALWAYS sticky and looks greasy. Yes sticky. If I press my palm against it, my hand will afterwards feel as if I've covered it in something sugary. Same goes for my hair brush, which is now also constantly sticky. As you can probably imagine, this makes my hair look AWFUL. It looks greasy and as if I've used wax on the entire top of my head :( I've tried shampoo before water, water before shampoo, with conditioner, without conditioner, cold water, hot water, lukewarm water, lemon juice, avocado, five different kinds of shampoo (and conditioner), washing my hair everyday, washing my hair once a week, rinsing a lot, not rinsing at all... You name it. My doctor doesn't know what it is, my dermatologist doesn't know what it is, my hair dresser doesn't know what it is, and not a single one of my friends have ever heard of or had a problem like this.

It's been like this for the past six months, since I (for medical reasons) had to wash it everyday during december. I think that took a toll on my hair but now I can't fix this awful problem. I'm a 21 year old girl with constantly dirty hair :'(

Any redditors who can help me??

EDIT: A couple of pictures for reference. Taking pictures of your own hair is really hard, btw... And it looks much worse in reality.

1358902726.0	173bmj	Hello from /r/skincareaddiction!	chromiselda	14	4	2	"Hi there all you lovely /r/hair subscribers!

I just wanted to introduce you to our lovely subreddit /r/skincareaddiction. We've only been around for a year but have grown tremendously since we began. We love to talk about all things skincare - moisturizers, acne, puffy eyes, hand creams... and the list goes on.

We're more scientifically minded than some other subs and so you can be assured that most of the advice that you receive will be based on evidence beyond just personal experiences.

We've recently started a new tradition of monthly group testing. It's not as scary as it sounds: all we do is let the community pick 2 products that they'd like to test each month, and then we go ahead and pit them against each other. [Here's a link to the one we started this month](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1603as/group_testing_buy_your_product_we_start_in_10_days/).

It would be great to have some more hair minded folks over at our place. Personally I'd love to talk shampoos, conditioners and hair masks (do they help??) with you guys, and I know a lot of others would too!

Hope to see a bunch of you at /r/skincareaddiction soon :)"	t5_2qmsf	True

I have natural blonde hair but its been various other colours so the blonde it has atm is already dyed. Used [Nordic Silver Blonde](http://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/is-bin/intershop.static/WFS/TWL-B2C-Site/TWL-B2C/en_NZ/product/large/60/1c/9310714214084_l.jpg) by Schwarzkopf. I have long thick hair so I bought 3 packets @ $10 AUD each, needed all three. My own roots were about 2-3inches long so I didn't bother with a roots first application I just did the whole thing. My hair tangles and ends up a mess if I try and do a roots first application as well. The mix is pretty hard to apply, it comes with a lightening powder that stays kinda grainy in the mix. I left it on a lot longer than the developing time (45 min) simply because it took forever to apply. It turned light yellow very quickly and then stayed that way, there was a very short orange phase. The packet also comes with a toner sachet.. I didn't have high hopes for it and sure enough it did absolutely nothing, I left it on for about 10 minutes (recommends about 3 minutes I think). Then resorted to using my rinse through toner (Brilliant silver white, I order it online). My toner worked out well on the top, the underside requires more toner next time I wash it, you can see in the pictures it's still gold. It's left my hair quite dry but its the lightest I've ever achieved using a packet. Though it may be dry because I did a crappy job of blowdrying it and then hit it with a curling iron. Kinda regret doing it but it should settle down over the next few washes. So if anyone is looking to use this product only do it if you have also own an excellent toning product, the one in the box is useless. But it does give you a very light result.

In my opinion, my daughter desperately needs a haircut, but her mother refuses and says her hair is fine. My wife went to school for cosmetology and agrees that the ends of her hair are dry and brittle. She has only had one haircut and she's almost 7 years old.

**EDIT:**

I did not want to anger her mother too much, so I only cut off a couple of inches. I know that it needs a few more off, but i will handle that in about a months time. Here's what it looks like now after only getting 2-3 inches snipped off. I think it looks much better, though you can still see a bit of breakage higher up

Kaissy	11	3	9	"Hey guys, I'm a male who has hair that goes a little below the ears, and has been using what I assume is relatively cheap hair straightener because I hate my shitty curly/wavy/dog hair. But lately as my hair has grown longer, it doesn't seem like the hair straightener is doing as much as before. It will get back to my natural hair quite fast, like after 3 hours or so, when before it would last like the entire day.

So I was wondering maybe it has to do with the straightener? And like the question states, what is the difference between expensive ones and cheap ones. To me they're just a really hot piece of metal, they don't look that different. And any suggestions for a hair straightener?

I have a National Diploma in Beauty Therapy Sciences and have been working on a cruise ship as a beauty therapist for two years. After much consideration I have decided to come back to land and go back to college to train as a hairdresser.

I am currently applying for various apprenticeships in my area and am conducting a small experiment to go along with my applications to give me that small advantage over the many, many other applicants.

Anyhow, I was hoping I could get some advice on what to do with super dry hair. About 6 months ago I did a home bleaching so I could home dye to bright red. The red washed out, but the bright blonde went to a dull brown. And very very dry. I went to the salon to get all of the dyed back to my natural brown and she said the dye would help with the dryness. It hasn't. Last night I tried using some veggie oil (heating it up a bit) and now I'm sitting in my living room with mayo in my hair. 

Also, my hair is very very thick and kinda long, past my shoulders, not quite to my butt. 

I guess what I'm asking is.. Will this work? Should I switch from color safe shampoo to something else? I've quit using a brush and only use a wide tooth comb.  Is there anything else I can throw into my hair to help?

I've never dyed my hair, but today I noticed that one of my hairs near the front of my head is red.  Does hair color change naturally?  I'm not much of hair enthusiast, so I really don't know much about hair.  I only knew about this subreddit because I was trying to find a good place to post this question. It just seems so odd to me that my hair turned to a *lighter* color.  At first I thought it was just the lighting, but I managed to grab the individual hair and get a better look, and it's definitely a different color.  It's about 3-4 inches long, and the very tip of it is my normal brown color.  The rest is a (very beautiful) golden red color.  I know sun can lighten hair color, but I don't spend much time in the sun at all, and that hasn't changed recently.  Furthermore, it's only ONE hair, and none of the nearby hairs seem to have lightened up any.  And, like I said, the color change appears to be from the root.  The end is the normal color.

I'm 21 right now.  I've been using the same shampoo for years (V05).  I use shampoo only every few days.  I let my hair air dry, and don't brush it while wet.  I used to keep it really short for many years, but in the past year, I've started growing it out because I wanted to have a little fun braiding it.  It's naturally kind of curly.  No tight curls or anything, but  it can be pretty curly on days. Is it just a fluke? Like, one of my hair follicles suddenly decided that it likes orange better?  Or did something I do cause it? I'm not really worried or anything.  Just really, really curious, and kind of confused."	t5_2qmsf	True

I've got a good one.	shellehbelleh	8	0	18	"So, before my graduation/ prom, I had been in contact with this local hairdresser for weeks (maybe even months). I had popped by his salon several times to talk about ideas of what would look nice and what my hair could do. He had even come in and visited me at my work. Finally, the big day came and I showed up at his salon... And he was drunk. Yes, you read correct. *Drunk*. He kept drinking, AND smoking, the whole time I was there.
He tried filling my hair with rollers/ curlers, but his hands were shaking so bad that by the end of it, my hair was jut going in crazy directions, half of it hanging out. I was horrified, but I'm the sort of person who won't speak up. SO I sat there, on the verge of tears, as he went crazy plastering my hair with strong hair spray. He then teased it. All the while saying, ""Beautiful Darlin'! You're stunning! Love it babe!"".
I eventually had to push his shaking hands away, and had to ""fix it"" myself. Because it was just a messy birds nest of hair, all I could do was pin it up at the back on to my head. He had made a ridiculous ""curl"" on one side of my face that couldn't be fixed.

When *I* had finally done what I could to save my hair (not much), he sent me away to an ATM to get out cash to pay (he was trying to cheat his bosses and pretend I was never there, so he could keep the cash in hand). I went to the ATM, and called the best person to help in this situation: Mum. She got straight in her car, drove to the salon, and told that hairdresser just what she thought of him. I never went back with my money. But I did go and cry; I was so emotionally exhausted from holding in tears for so long, and devastated that this day was ruined for me.

3. If I want to keep the new color for awhile, how often would I need to dye it? I wash my hair every day. And if I do it myself at home, do those hair dye kits that I can buy only have enough of the dye for one dye job?

4. After dying, do I have to wait awhile before washing it?

5. Lastly, does anyone have any color suggestions? I was thinking a dark brown, or something with red in it. I'm kind of scared to do this, so I might not go through with it, but I'd at least like to get some more information before I make a decision either way."	t5_2qmsf	True

I have read multiple ways online on how to do it and I would like to do it with boiling water.

My question is, is there any way I can assure that my tips will line up when I dye them? I am going to tie sections of my hair off with ponytails and I would like for them to look at least pretty lined up. Any tips?"	t5_2qmsf	True

So I've always had a bit of a problem with the crown of my scalp / where my ponytail sits with dandruff/dry skin that peels. I've been able to deal with it though.

However the past few months it seems to have become a lot worse and thick and has spread along to the sides of my head also (like approx. a few inches above my ears). It's itchy and I'm able to pulls/scratch off fairly thick chunks of what I'm assuming is dead/dried skin.

Is there any tips I can get for getting rid of this? I've tried using head and shoulders but that doesn't seem to do much. It's never been this bad before, and I'm wondering if it's partially from stress.

Anyway thank you in advance!

My hair had no noticeable damage and all the conditioning I've been doing has greatly improved the texture of my hair overall.

Unfortunately, the color-corrector wore off after a few days and my hair started turning back to its original color. It was defeating, but at least it hadn't come at the cost of healthy hair.  I had heard rumors that color-correctors had a tendency to darken, so the mistake was on my part.
So, I repeated the process and this time continued the rest of my plan before it had a chance to darken.

After a little bit of research, I went out and bought Excellence Creme Blonde Supreme by L'Oreal and decided to replace bleaching with that. Remarkably, my hair is ONCE AGAIN in better condition after treatment. It didn't work as well as using bleach would work, but it notably lifted a lot of color and there isn't a trace of orange/copper in my hair. The color is very even, and I believe repeating the process 2 - 3 more times will get me to the shade I need to continue with toning.

1374532035.0	1iue9l	I have this really long hair that I'm just not sure what to do with anymore.	hairthrowa	9	1	5	"So, I've had long hair practically my whole life. The last time I had it cut short, I was five years old and had to do it because I messed up by playing barber shop with my friend of the same age. Of course I've had countless trims since then, but that should be a given. As for damaging it, the only thing I do regularly is dye my roots/run it through. I almost never style it with heat. However, I did decide to get a perm last December, which I had my nana do because she did go to cosmetology school and she used to do them for girls all the time in the 80s. I wanted hair like Julia Roberts in *Pretty Woman*, but my nana's skills must have escaped her. I think she put too much hair on the rods and left them in horizontally rather than vertically for a spiral perm. I do have naturally wavy hair, so I was surprised it didn't take. Now I'm left with an even more uneven texture than what I started with along with the damage. 

Since then, my hair has just been frustrating the hell out of me. The only conditioners that make it brushable after I shower are the expensive, salon-type ones. I've been switching between Nexxus and Infusium, and during my last trip to the hair aisle I found Organix and picked up the keratin oil conditioner and the moroccan argan oil conditioners, which I like a lot. I also picked up some Joico K-Pak recently after having it reccommended to me several times during haircuts. I've been using it mostly as a leave-in conditioner on my ends, but I did use it to deep-condition twice. That seems to be helping the damage. While I used to be able to do absolutely nothing to it, it no longer looks decent unless I take the time to put it in a braid to give it uniformity and keep it from tangling and getting frizzy. I've really been thinking about cutting it short, but the hair that would remain would actually be where the perm did take, which is mostly on the right side of my head and I think a patch in the back. I seem to be able to camouflage it with long hair.

Today I'm actually having one of the first good, completely natural days I've had in a while. It usually doesn't look as nice and evenly textured as it does in these pictures. I showered last night and slept on it while leaving it down. Here are several pictures showing my hair in various ways. Forgive me if I've gone overboard, but I'm a details kind of person. I tried making an album, but imgur was being stubborn.

Whenever I picture myself with short hair, though, I picture it straight and sleek like [this](http://styleshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Jessica-Alba-Charming-Short-Hair-Style-Look-02.jpg) or [this](http://www-deadline-com.vimg.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/claireandtemp_lg-225x300.jpg).

I'm sure it would only take five minutes to straighten my hair at that length, but I'm not sure that I really want to do that to my hair.

Overall, I'm just looking for some advice on what I might be able to do to feel better about my hair whether I cut it or not. Whether it be easy styling advice or reccommendations on what kind of cut would look best with my face.

Then around summer 2012, I guess it just got too much build up. It was like a wad of blegh on top of my head that would turn greasy the night of the day after I shower.

And then I went no-poo. I washed my hair with a combination of apple cider vinegar and baking soda, which made it seem really clean. I could go a whole entire week without washing unless I got extremely sweatylicious. 

But now it's summer, and I fear that washing once every week is not going to work. I wake up and I am really hot and gross, and let me tell you, water-only washing does not have the best of fragrances. 

I'm a guy, and I've got fine brown hair, not really thick at all. My friend suggested a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, but that's all she told me, no brand recommendations. I'm also sick of getting greasy the very next night. I've heard that Pantene Pro-V shampoo and conditioner 2-in-1 volume is good for this, but I've also heard that it leaves a ton of build up.

I've had long hair my entire life. The shortest it's ever been is at my shoulders and even then I don't know what to do with it. Other girls I know with long hair are always styling it differently, or curling or straightening it, always making their hair look damn near perfect. I'm not like that. I shower, blow dry it, and go. To me, styling my hair means straightening it so it looks a little under control. Very rarely do I ever do that though as it takes almost an hour to dry and an extra hour to make sure its all straight and even. I hate wasting that much time every day on something that doesn't even matter to me, and at the end of the day it always looks just as bad as it did before I got into the shower in the first place. I've been thinking about shaving my head for a few months now. Of course my family and friends don't want me to, they think my long hair is ""beautiful"" but they don't realize what a pain it is, and how much I dislike doing it every day.

1374847855.0	1j3ijf	What should I do?	LadyGriggs	6	1	11	"[My Hair](http://i.imgur.com/2D4WUK9.jpg)

So right now my hair is basically long and straight and has a natural ombre thing going on (which I think is cool).  I want to do something different as far as cut or style because it has been like this for a while, but I have a few likes that are a huge consideration for whatever I do.  

I farm for a living.  So, I essentially need to be able to pull all my hair back if it is long.  This means I don't really want to go back to angling because when it was angled (although cute) some wasn't long enough to pull back.  Long story short, anything loose can get caught in machinery and can seriously harm me (buns or ponytails are my working hair style).  The less practical reason I don't want to do this is because I really enjoy the fact that it is now all long enough to braid and style.  I have considered side bangs because I can tuck them back into my  hat at work and they don't necessarily have to go into a braid.  

I also greatly enjoy the length because out of all the lengths (from pixie cut to long) both myself and my husband prefer my long hair.  I feel both like I can do more with it and like it is sexier on me.  

I also really enjoy that it has naturally done this ombre thing because of being in the sun as much as I am.  My hair, even before this, tends to have a lot of different color dimension.  In the past, it has flattened my hair to color it, so I'd be very hesitant to color it again.  

So the question is what subtle change can I make in cut or how I wear it to give it a new look without taking away what I love?  I would be open to perhaps putting peroxide or lemon juice in the bottom to bring out more of the blond.  Any suggestions are welcome, thank you ladies (and fellas:).

I've dyed it in the past, usually varying shades of red, but occasionally gone brunette as well. I dyed it just about 3 weeks ago with Garnier Olia 6.60 ""light intense auburn"", I thought the color was okay but it didn't take very well and it is fading out really unevenly. I liked the formula, though, and I think part of why it came out uneven is because it was virgin hair (my hair is short and I hadn't dyed it in several months). It needs to be dyed again, and I was planning on dying it the same color again and seeing if it takes better the second time around, but I've had the ""deep violet"" shade in the back of my mind for a while now. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair when I was younger, so I feel like I kind of missed out on my ""crazy hair color"" opportunities. I'm not working right now, so this seems like a good time to try something out, right?

Anyway, [here are some unflattering pictures of me in natural lighting](http://imgur.com/a/3QYg7). I also included one of me with my hair the darkest it has been, though the lighting isn't good there.

**edit**
I forgot to ask, do any of you know anyone who has used this color? Or have you tried it? I've had a hard time finding any reviews or pictures of what it actually looks like (I don't think [promotional photos](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8516332288_3edce541a5.jpg) are very accurate, usually...). If you have had experience with this color, I have some questions:

* How purple is it? It appears to be dark with a purple hint more so than *super purple*. I saw a review that said it wasn't very purple at all, though.
* How dark is it? Saw a review that said it was more of a dark brown, but it looks purple/black to me.
* How did it fade? Did it keep well, or did you have to dye it again soon after?

1364162126.0	1axp2w	Advice on Nicer and More Complimentary Hair?	Serae	10	4	12	"I am not the most beauty savy person, but since graduating from college I have been making a point to put more effort into my appearance (I wear some makeup now and don’t live in jeans, boots and button ups anymore).    My hair is something I have always struggled with and would love some opinions.

I have brown hair that seems to change shades depending on the light.  Sometimes I have golden highlights, sometimes red, and sometimes a mute mousey brown.  I used to think it was an ash brown. I don’t know if I would benefit from a new color but am open to suggestions.  I have a cool skin tone (rather pink) and very dark brown eyes.  I don’t have any grey hair.

 My hair is very thin and very long.  Its texture changes from day to day.  On a good day I have nice, long ringlets and waves.  On not so good hair days every strand seems to vary from being brittle and ragged, to wavy or straight.  Because my hair is thin it easily looks greasy and seems to get matted easily.  I wear my hair up most days because I can’t seem to get a consistent texture or to keep it looking sleek and soft.  I prefer waves and ringlets over straight hair.  Straight hair makes my lack of volume apparent.

I would prefer to keep my hair long and find a product I could put in and leave alone.  I am interested in something with minimal work that will give me a soft texture and nice ends.  The ends of my hair often look ragged even though I get cuts regularly.  I am wondering if I need to chop a ton of my hair off in order to make it look nicer.

My hair seems to be pretty healthy.  I use sulfate and paraben free shampoos and conditioners.  I use apple cider vinegar every few weeks to clarify.  I also use argan and coconut oil as a mask occasionally.   I think because my hair is thin that this is why my ends look ragged.  I try not to blowdry my hair too often, but I do more often in the winter time.  It takes nearly all day for my hair to dry on its own.

**Kid**: Hair turns black

**Bit older**: Parents make me cut it short - look like a dork

**Teen**: Decide to let it grow. - ""don't do it, it'll look bad"" (parents)

**Bit older**: Started off bad, but as it grew turns out i have great hair

**Bit older**: Decide to dye it blonder (grunger/punkish) ""oh, day dude...(friends) - turns out nice, looks bad with a bit beard (blonde hair - dark beard contrast)

**Bit older**: Black roots showing - ""you should die it again"" - i said fuck it, and realize it now looks nice with some beard (i don't have a strong one, it's genetic)

**Now**: Tired of shampoos and conditioners, i decide to stop washing and just brush in mornings for a while.

**Result**: Stopped curling (no wash), straight blonde endings/black root and beard, look like Kurt Cobain, BITCH I'M FABULOUS.

**Conclusion**: Fuck others opinions, fuck products that what at the end of the year is a fortune and society and media push on you, gain hundreds of hours a year not shaving/washing hair every day.

PS: It smells good and isn't oily, it's silky. (some studies shows washing your hair is actually harmfull [unlike your body ofc]).

 (sorry for the creep-face, I promise I'm not here to murder anyone) 

I hate that even with product in my hair, the sides try to stand out straight, and the shorter I cut it, the worse it gets. Thus, I've been noticing some hair styles in films set in the 20s to 40s that I'm starting to think I could pull off.

James Darmody in Boardwalk Empire:  http://www.hellousdaily.com/dlyhlls/wp-content/plugins/RSSPoster_PRO/cache/9ab36_james-darmody-hair-boardwalk-empire.jpg

I like the idea of just buzzing the sides off and being able to wear my hair back for a classy look or pushing it to the back/side for more casual situations. 

My concerns:

1: is this look going to look weird because it is so dated (to the prohibition era, and I realize the mid-90s if I don't pull it off)? 

2: will it look strange if I wear a beard with this cut? 

3: how will it grow out/what's the upkeep on a hairstyle like this?

Recently, I came upon this fairly obvious epiphany that people who choose to dye their hair in non-traditional colors (ex. the varying shades of blue, green, red, orange, purple, pink, etc.) face a lot of issues regarding public attention, scrutiny, judgment, etc. Of course, the non-traditional hair color movement is growing, but in general, people with non-traditional hair colors are still in the minority.

That being said, [my last hair color](http://i.imgur.com/HsBL9.jpg) (bangs only, rest of hair kept natural black) was a bright green/turquoise. I used Manic Panic's Atomic Turquoise (amplified) and was absolutely in love with the color. I am a university student, so I am able to get away with wearing non-traditional hair colors.

However, I just took on an internship with a social services agency that is fairly liberal. Their dress code is definitely business casual, but a bit more ""casual"". However, as the new intern, I do not wish to rouse anyone and jeopardize my position with ""outrageous"" colored hair.

For those with experience with non-traditional hair colors - what do you believe are the most accepted non-traditional hair colors in professional work settings? Please indicate the specific shade &amp; brand (ex. Burgandy Wine/Special Effects USA, Shocking Blue/Manic Panic, etc.)

On a related note, what do you all think of the ""professionalism"" of bright orange color hair? [example](http://3.media.haircrazy.info/photos/gallery/2011/01/16/110116-120631_t_w500_h500.jpg)

First off - I'm a young white guy with mid length brown hair. It's very fine, but there's lots of it. It's naturally straight - I mean, so straight that nearly *everyone* assumes I straighten it every day. Due to this fineness/straightness, it goes pretty flat. I do my best to toussle it up throughout the day but doing this too much makes it greasy. Hair products like wax or clay don't seem to work - I'm assuming due to how 'fine' my hair is - they look okay at first, but seem to lose their power after a couple of hours, leaving me with strandy hair. Not a good look!

Now, I go on a beach holiday once or twice a year with friends, and after spending a few hours in the sea bodyboarding or whatever, my hair looks great (even if I say so myself!). It has volume, and is choppy - and it will stay this way for hours. 

How can I best replicate this look at home? I shower every morning before work and normally let my hair air-dry/help it along with a towel. I thought about perhaps misting it with a bottle of homemade saltwater after washing, but before getting out of the shower. Will this damage my hair? Will it even work?

Lately, within the last month or two, it's started falling out. It's not breakage, the whole hair is falling out from the follicle.

I'm talking 5 or 6 strands coming out when I run my fingers through my hair. Compounded up through the day, it has to be at least 40 strands falling out. I end up with a good sized clump while shampooing my hair too. Even more falls out when I try to dry my hair. It's absolutely insane, and I'm starting to get really worried.

I've tried not heat-drying my hair, but it hasn't gotten better. If anything, it's gotten a little bit worse because I have to detangle my hair after it's dry and even more hair falls out.

I'm thinking it might be the shampoo that I'm using. It's a Pantene brand ""Nature Fusion Moisture Balance"" shampoo, and I'm only using it because it was on sale at Costco. I also started using a hair straightener to curl my hair about 3 months back on a roughly once or twice per month basis, so that might also be a cause.

Something like this, maybe a bit longer. I think it's just a case of using clippers long enough so everything's the same length, but I thought I'd ask you guys, maybe you have some experience in this.  
Another reason for this is that the sun gives me migraines and the doctor says I should wear a hat when I'm outside, and right now I get terrible hat-hair, this would also prevent that particular problem. &gt;_&gt;

I'm looking to completely remake myself for the next year and become the person I want to be and one of the steps I am currently working on is my look. I'm looking for a new haircut that will go well with my body type. I'm 5 foot 10, 140 pounds (working on gaining weight over the next year), am pretty pale (working on getting more tan as well) have a long face, and a mildly pointed chin.

I am looking for a shorter hairstyle that will all me to look more sharp and clean cut when wearing well fitting, stylish clothes (getting advice from /r Mens fashion advice). Although I'm looking for something shorter I would be equally happy with a longer one as long as it makes me look good. The last picture in the album describes my hair the best, but I tried to show different phases of my hair.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions and even more so appreciate specifics and links to pictures of the haircuts you are describing. Thanks so much!

She cut up the rest of it with the parameters ""I want something low maintenance, no product, no blow drying; just get up and go"" and I ended up with the Rachel haircut from Friends.

Cons:

*I kind of hate it

*I may be stuck with short pigtails until it grows out


Neutral:

*I look different

Pros:  

*My hair is shorter which is great because it's the summer and hot as balls

*My hair will hopefully go towards someone who needs it

*My boyfriend loves it, but he kind of has to (he's very sweet)

*I got a free haircut (just paid for tip)

*Hair grows

I had a great stylist give me a healthy cut and a deep conditioning to try and re-hydrate (I die my hair at home, blonde - I KNOW IT'S BAD. BUT I AM BROKE. Can'f afford salon highlights/dyes).

So now I wanna keep it healthy.  I want to stop straightening it - that is clearly what breaks my ends, I could tell when I did it today.  I have an awful natural wave, but I want to embrace it.

Here are products I currently use:

1. Pantene - Curl Enhancer - spray gel - after shower
(I usually then would defuse my hair after that, and then use my crimper to give body to those flat ends/pieces.... **AKA most of my hair**)
2. Herbal Essences - Tousle me softly - Tousling hairspray
3. Herbal Essences - Tousle me softly - Finishing touch cream (I use this to make it less crunchy looking, yet keep the wave/crimps from straightening, kinda beachy (?) looking

For general use, if I blow dry, curl, natural crimp, etc.

 1. Ganier Fructis Style - Hi-Rise Lift - Root Booster
 2. Ganier Fructis Style - Sleek &amp; Shine - Anti-Humidity Hairspray


Any ideas/suggestions?  I want to avoid using heat tools often in order to try and damage my hair less and help it grow.  I am also taking biotin every day to try and help my hair get healthier.

OK, lately we have seen a lot of girls pulling of the Skrillex-esq side shave! But, can normal, everyday people pull it off? I’ve seen a few girls around Charlotte sporting the freshly shaved comb over. There is a bartender who works at a few of the popular bars, who pulls it off nicely. I decided to write this today, after being asked to have it done to myself. After spending an hour on Google looking at all the girls who have taken that jump, and obviously have a large set of cajones! I also posted a photo on Facebook, and asked the advice of my peers. Even though only one person said yes, I’ve decided to go ahead and do it! They should know better than to tell me no 

Now, I’m sitting here shaking in my knee high brown leather boots! Waiting for the chair to be open, is a little nerve wrecking. But, look how cute these girls look, it’s somewhat sexy. It’s definitely daring. I’ve been contemplating a crazy change, either an obnoxious hair color, since I’ve already chopped it off in a funky asymmetrical cut. Now, here I am going to shave the side YIKES!! Carmen Electra just took the leap, I mean if she can do it… I can too! So, breathe in breathe out! It’s only hair, right? It will grow back!  I think it’s funny, all of my friends except for three of them are spending these next few minutes, to talk me out of it. Also, Logan is deciding what kinda of crazy color she’s going color the spot with. I must say, I have always noticed the style however, I have never considered doing it myself.

I am one of those people that once you put an idea of a crazy hair style in my head, it ends up becoming a reality.

So, we just shaved the small sub section, Reid thinks I should wait to do the full section, since it’s so new. Which I am OK  with. So, my natural hair color is so light we had to color the sub section. I agreed to let Logan bleach it, then cover with teal. She also colored the front piece purple. I am so excited, I am looking forward to doing the full section. I cannot wait to see how it looks styled!

 

So the cut is now done, and I must say last night was pretty interesting! I guess it’s not often you see a female with one side of her head shaved, and has is hot pink. It doesn’t really matter what others think, I absolutely love it! I am actually having a friend who is a barber, carve designs in the shaved area. Now, who else is ready for a funky do?

I have had short hair for quite awhile and am in the process of growing it out, but it has not been cut for some time.

Now, I have a large forehead which has always made me desire bangs, but I've had them done twice now, and BOTH times I have been given this:

Sparse bangs can suck it - they are miserable to style, and do nothing but, in my opinion, CALL ATTENTION to my forehead.

I feel that something like this would be better, but I imagine shorter because I have glasses and therefore the hair doesn't fall properly onto my brow:

If I am INCORRECT in my bangs idea, is there anything anyone could think of that would do well in hiding my larger forehead?

On the lowest section I painted 3/4 of the section with lightener, second was half the section, and I did nothing to the top section. After we washed the lightener out we toned it with 9/4 creative (tigi copyright colour). The stupid thing was that my instructor told me to wash the toner out after 5 minutes...

So, what should I do to dye my hair blonde (maybe a slightly ""brassy"" almost strawberry blonde?) with the least amount of $$.  Do I need to buy some dye stripper to go in my hair first or can I go straight for the bleach?

Now my hair is still way, doesn't stay straight, and I'm out $90. Should I go back and demand that she do it again correctly, ask for my money back, or just let it go? Also, can I do it again myself or at a different salon? I don't want to fry my hair by doing it again too soon."	t5_2qmsf	True

My hair is naturally EXTREMELY curly, to the point where I got sick of it and got it chemically straightened. I wash it once a week (sometimes once every 1 1/2 weeks), and it looks nice after maybe 2 days of straightening it, but before the 2 days it looks like crap. The back is unnaturally poofy, even after I brush and straighten it. And whenever I get it wet or sweat even the tiniest bit (I play volleyball....nuf said.) only the ends get curly and the rest gets really frizzy and I have no clue how to fix it except by putting it in a ponytail, and that leaves a retarded bump in my hair and I fry my hair fixing it, so I don't straighten my hair too much and like to leave it wavy (due to how curly my hair was, the chemicals didn't take all of the curl out of it, just about 90% of it), but it gets frizzy after a few hours of leaving it ""natural"" too.

I have shorter hair than what I would like and have been reading lots of tips here to grow my hair out longer. Lots of the tips are reasonable and I am trying to implement as many as possible, but the one I cannot manage is to not brush or comb my wet hair. I like to shower in the morning and not look like a crazy person when I step out the door, and my hair looks insane if I don't brush it. How could I deal with this without causing breakage by brushing it while wet?

For reference, my hair is about an inch shorter than shoulder length, and I can't put it up yet at all. I'm several inches from that point. The main reason that it looks crazy wet and unbrushed is because I have extremely thick hair."	t5_2qmsf	True

I'd been box dying it red (a really bright power red from feria loreal) for a while and with my new job my hair has to be a natural color. I went to the hairdresser and got it dyed back close to my natural color, but the red still showed through a little, which I didn't mind.

However, now I'm debating going blonde for a while and then dying it purple once I'm no longer restricted. I want to box dye it without bleaching it. Do I have to strip the color from my hair first to avoid making it orange? What should I use and how long do I have to wait between stripping and dying? I heard that when dying your hair blonde you should dye it lighter than what you actually want. Is there anything I should know about undertones and such?

First a bit about me.. - At the moment, my hair is quite long, sits just on my chest - Naturally it is a very dark blonde/mousey brown but for the past 7 years I have been dying it myself dark brown and I love it this colour - I tend to dye it every few months as the regrowth isn't too bad and I only do it to top up the colour on top
Now, I've been wanting to get the ends of my hair lightened in the balayage/ombre style as I am a bit over having my hair all the one block of colour without any highlights etc.
However, the ends of my hair hold a lot of colour from dye jobs (so I've been told by my hair dresser) as obviously the colour grows out on top first and the ends stay the darkest.
Is it possible for colourists to do the balayage/ombre colouring effect on dyed hair? My friend says it is doable, but they have to strip the ends of their colour first and then its redone. I just don't want to be putting lightened hair day on my black-ish ends if it's going to turn out orange!!
Any tips or pointers would be great :)
Thanks!

1334589683.0	sch5r	Salt and Pepper at 25...		7	2	8	"So. I'm not 100% sure where I'm going with this but bear with me.

I'm 25. 
I have the unlucky or lucky roll of the dice that I have been going silver since I was 13. I've been growing in long thick strong silver hairs for almost a decade. 

But when I turned 25 I had gotten to about 75% Black/Brown mix 25% Silver. 

I Say silver, because I get grey hairs too. They are weak, thin, brittle, and tend to fall out with just brushing my hair. 

They are also a slightly different more white shade. 

So when I turned 25 I got embarrassed and started dying my hair black like it was when I was 8. No one noticed it, Very rarely do people notice anything about my hair. Which I guess I'm ok with. But I could go from 5 inches to almost bald and more people wouldn't bat an eyelash at it. 

Anyway. I stopped dying my hair. I haven't dyed my hair since about December? But I got my hair cut back last month and suddenly everyone sees my hair and they tell me how gorgeous it is, because of the silver. 


I guess what my question is.

How frequent is it for people to get Salt and Pepper at a young age?

Come 12th grade and I spontaneously bleach and dye my hair pink. Then brown for my graduation. Since then, I have gone though about every style and color you can think of. Bleached it tons of times. Obviously a huge mistake. I wish I could start over and change it, but I can't.

Today, my hair is thick and frizzy. My once perfectly straight hair is now wavy (which happened during my pregnancy) The back of my head is very very curly in one spot at the roots. I can barely get a brush through it, if I run my hands through my hair, tons come out. Worst of all, I have terrible breakage throughout; which thankfully is hidden by my top layer. It is only about 2 inches long in some areas.

I do not straighten it, I don't even like the result when I do anymore. I wear it up all the time. I take nightly showers and have a bad habit of putting it in a bun and leaving it wet all night. 

I wash it approximately every 3 days and have been doing my best to put It's a 10 on it after I wash it.

Most recently my hair was red, then dyed brown and highlights added throughout. The underneath half is blonde.
I have no idea what to do. I wish I could chop it all off and start over, but I absolutely cannot bring myself to do that. As of now, it is past my shoulders, but not growing very fast.

Late last year, I decided I wanted fire engine red hair.  It didn't work out as well as I wanted and it ended up taking a very long time to get the color I wanted. 

First trip: I ended up with an all over color, no bleaching, no lightening, also no red.  It was like a dark auburn color.  It was beautiful, but not what I wanted. 

Second trip one week later:  Bleached highlights and an all over demi color.  It was reddish and reddish orange.  It was actually kind of pretty.  But still not what I wanted. 

Third trip one week since the last:  The same thing - bleached more highlights and the same all over demi color.  I got so many compliments on my hair.  It was actually really unique looking.  Very red, orange, blone, it sounds like a mess but it wasn't.  It also wasn't what I wanted.  

Did some research and found the L'Oreal HiColor HiLights.  The dye contains a lightener (I think bleach) in it, so you don't have to use so much in getting bright red hair.  Finally, I got what I wanted: http://imgur.com/uBWCj5M (This was one week and one wash later).  

I loved it, but didn't like the upkeep.  

So about two months later after the color faded so much that the bleached parts of my hair turned pink and blonde, I did an all over plum/brunette.  It was gorgeous and I loved it.  It kept well EXCEPT for the hair that was previously bleached.  It very quickly faded to a grey/lavendar/blonde color.  The rest of it eventually faded to a red.  

This is what my hair looks like now (several months later): http://imgur.com/QDjd1rE

The ends are very dry and very brittle.  My hair used to be very soft and easy to deal with.  Now, it tangles easily, doesn't feel nearly as soft any more, and it gets frizzier than usual.  It's also very thin and fine. I prefer having long hair, but I'm thinking I want to cut it pretty short to get rid of the dead ends.  However, since my face is so round, I'm wondering how it would look.  

Please, any ideas and input would be greatly appreciated.  I'm way past due for a haircut anyway (it, at the very least, needs to be trimmed).  I've recently started using a cheap, oil treatment I found at a drug store.  It's helped a little.  But I'm just ready to chop it off.

But my experiences with specialized shampoos (mainly different kinds of herbel essences, such as ones that supposedly straighten your hair) have been pretty disappointing and never had the supposed effects.

Will a color-protecting shampoo and conditioner really make a huge difference? My hair color fades pretty quickly after dying it, which is a little disappointing. But I also really love the Suave shampoo that I normally use (and will be pretty sad if I have to give up the awesome green apple scent that I'm used to lol).

EDIT: So, getting this done was actually kind of a bitch. I told the hairdresser I wanted the sides shaved, keep the length on the top and try to fade it. She insisted that I start with a 3 1/2, but the product wasn't satisfactory. I then talked her down to a 2, which she explained would be accompanied with more off the top. She told me that in the most colorful way, using terms such as ""bowl cut"" and ""weird flop"". After she had finished the sides she decided that she was wrong about the top and the haircut was finished. I then asked for a wax for hold, she told me that my hair was too long and gave me gel.

The end product is nice, not exactly what I wanted, but nice. All in all I think I'm just going to go to a barber next time, the lady who cut it this time was obviously older and didn't quite see what I wanted. "	t5_2qmsf	True

Even if there is some way to rescue my hair from this, I've still been considering short hair for quite a while now. My girlfriend got her hair cut to about three inches around a year ago, and that particularly made me think I could pull it off.

I'm a little nervous about trying it out, and I'm not even sure what haircut I should get. Reddit, based on the pictures linked to above (here again: http://imgur.com/a/1ua9x ) and how my face looks, what hairstyle would be best? Keep in mind that I'm about 5'3"" (160 cm) tall and I weigh around 105 pounds (48 kg), so my thin-as-a-stick frame might affect what would look good. Pictures would help, but really any suggestions would be appreciated!

And if you have no idea about the hairstyle, feel free to ask me questions or whatever! I'm about to go to bed so I don't obsessively check this post, but I'll be able to see and reply to your comments around eight hours after this is posted."	t5_2qmsf	True

1368444059.0	1e8ljb	Can my face shape/ hair type handle a pixie cut?	shellehbelleh	8	2	4	"So, I've always wanted to try out a pixie cut, but have always been too scared. I've been way too adventurous with trying other things though; I've had a perm (spiral curls!), chemical straighten (wut? why?!), dyed it dark brown (and several other dark shades) and now I'm back to a short perm.

My natural hair colour is ginger/ auburn/ red, and my natural hair type is odd. It is not curly, nor is it straight. It's not even wavy. It's just... Fluffy. I live in a veeeeeeery humid place, so that doesn't help.
I'm currently trying to grow out a dark brown hair dye, but the ginger re-growth looks awful, so I'm thinking now would be the perfect time to just chop it all off and start fresh with a pixie cut. But can my fluffy hair handle it? And what about my face shape?
Sometimes my chin can look very defined and angular, but on some angles my face just looks chubby and round. Have a look for yourself at this album of random pics of me on different angles and with different things done to my hair. http://imgur.com/a/0gZNA

Prom is coming up on May 10th and I wasn't originally going to do anything with my hair (far too lazy...) but was convinced to by some other people. I have fine hair but a lot of it, so it's thick, but pretty light. This is the natural color, and it's really healthy (I don't color it, or use heat or products on it). The last time I got it cut was about two weeks ago when my friend had scissors and I let them have at it! I don't like using any kind of products, or using heat, but I'm willing to try. Mostly I just shampoo, conditioner, and towel/air dry.

I was thinking about [this](http://i.imgur.com/UutmQkI.jpg) sort of a style (even the hair I have now is almost too long for my liking), but I'm not too sure if I could pull it off? Or if it would be nice enough for things like prom/graduation? Seems pretty simple and safe.

I...don't really know what else to say here!

I've done bangs in a few different styles and I really like them, but they're a lot of upkeep for a curly haired girl living in Florida. I also have tried dark reddish hair and really dark brown hair in high school. These are all the main hairstyles I've been through, if this gives you any idea. [Ta-da!](http://imgur.com/a/8lCHD#0)

2. I need help managing my curly hair in humidity. It will look great when I leave my house and eventually turn into a complete frizz-ball. I also want to get my hair more healthy. It's pretty healthy now, but I know it could be better, and it needs to be if I'll be dyeing it. Does anyone have any suggestions?

**My hair is:** 
Thin, wispy, and breaks easily. I often compare it to cotton candy. It's medium brown, wavy/curly, but mostly just fluffy. The one good thing I can say about it is its' massive amount of volume!

My hair is a little less than shoulder length, and has been YEARS. I'm dying for a change, but don't want to go shorter (Did that a long time ago, wasn't for me). I have never dyed my hair because I am scared of messing it up irreparably in its' frail state :/ So I feel like growing out my hair is the only option, but it kind of seems like my hair may be at ""terminal length.""

**What I have been doing to my hair recently:**
I have been using Nioxin's three step system for about three months now, and have been noticing a lot more thickness near the roots, which is awesome! I rarely heat style my hair, but when I do I use a protector. I sometimes (about once a month or so) do a hair mask with egg and/or coconut oil. I also only wash my hair every other day or every third day. 

**My question:**
I got my hair trimmed about a month ago, and the stylist said that he did see lots of new growth at the roots (thanks Nioxin!) but there was still SO much breakage at the ends. He said I should get some kind of end-protector... But didn't go into much detail or give me a specific product. Does anyone know about a product such as this that they would recommend?

1366592275.0	1cu14i	Advice for hair dye virgin making an odd dye request?	CorduroyMagic	5	1	10	"Main Q: I have never dyed my hair before, either at home or in the salon, not even highlights.  So I’m looking for some advice on how to get it done, where to get it done/what to look for in a salon, caring for it, how to ask, reasonable prices ANYTHING!

My hair: I have VERY thick hair, almost every stylist or person who has dealt with my hair says it’s the thickest hair they’ve ever seen.

What I want to get: I want to dye it this color (http://goodlegs.tumblr.com/post/30425761522) and I like the idea of ombre, to keep the top natural.  However, I don’t want the line that ombre makes and I only want the one color.  Basically I want highlights on top that get denser/thicker/multiply until it’s solid read, like, half way down.  This is the closest image I’ve found of this idea (http://indulgy.com/post/trgFX4ekU1/cutte).

So, Questions:

-Does this make sense? How do I ask for this in a way that my stylist will give me what I want? Are there “terms’ to know or something?  I’m worried this is a weird request or won’t make sense so they will refuse to do it.

-Do any of you guys have anything similar?

-How do I find the right stylist and salon? I’m worried that it’s not normal so that stylist won’t have done it before, won’t understand, or will second-guess my decision.

-what would you say is a reasonable price to expect? Is it normal to call the salon for a “quote” or no?  If it is normal, does my odd request make it harder to price?
-Also feel free to include any other tips or tricks or advice you think relates, being a hair color virgin, I may not know what to ask!"	t5_2qmsf	True

I used to be very open to trying new things with my hair like dying it pink, and purple, and shaving parts and going blonde, and red, and chopping it all off. But, now I'm scared to change and I don't know why. I've been stuck, aside from a few small changes with my same black hair, with no real hair cut, and putting extensions in when I'm going out, and pulling it right up out of my face for work (because I cant have loose hair at work, as I work in health services, and its a rule that my hair can't be down.) My hair is very, very fine, and hair dressers always tell me my hair is like baby's hair, and it is very oily as well. It's hard to manage and will very rarely hold style. I don't know if I should just change the colour, or if a different cut would be more appropriate, but I'm just stuck. (As a side note, I prefer to have my hair long after many years of horrible short hair cuts, and it take me a VERY long time to grow out anything.)

This is my hair now! In the first picture is it miraculously straight (I never heat style my hair), the second picture really shows the colour difference in my hair currently, and the other two are just to help show how I style it/the natural texture. 

Basically, I got a pixie cut just over four years ago, and hated it almost immediately after (I think it was the front heavy bangs that did it), so I finally grew it out. I used to dye my hair black frequently, then about two years ago I decided that I wanted my natural colour back, or slightly more red, and so I got the black out (using colour OOPS, no bleach!), and then dyed my hair an auburn shade. The only issue was that since my hair had varying levels of damage/porosity, some of it was orange basically, you can see the aftermath in the second picture. 

I have had my hair more or less like this since I've started growing it out, no bangs, tucked behind the ears, and some long layers. I am itching for a big change again, and I have no idea what to do! I want something a bit more edgy, but still feminine. I am open to colour as well!

1362369250.0	19m94f	How do I go back to blonde?	buttercupcake	5	0	8	I dyed my whole head orange with koolaid and for a number of reasons that are my own fault, I'm unhappy with it and I want to go blonde again. This is the first time I've dyed my hair and I've never bleached it before, and I also have a fairly sensitive scalp. I've heard that sometimes dyeing hair blonde will leave it weirdly orange, and since my hair is already orange, I'm pretty afraid of that happening. So basically, do you have any tips/tricks for me? Any product recommendations? I'm pretty new to this stuff so any advice or anecdotes are helpful and welcome. Thanks in advance!	t5_2qmsf	True

1361682475.0	194ao8	Help me change up this boring, still-stuck-in-middle-school hairstyle PLEASE.	omgsrslyyy	4	0	4	"I've had this same basic side-part with ""side swept bangs"" hairstyle since 7th grade. I am entering college this fall and I want to break out of this boring, plain hairstyle. I just don't know what kind of hair would best complement my face.

Please suggest colors (especially highlights/lowlights) and new STYLES that I can get. I honestly have no idea! D: 

Here are a few pictures of the variations of the same hair style I've had over the years &amp; my face in general. (Some are a lot older than others, sorry for the awkwardness haha)

Some facts -
I am tall (5'10"") so I don't want too short of hair or I would just look more awkward than I already am. :P

I have wavy and pretty dry hair that is easily styled, but not very soft.

My hair is deceivingly very thick."	t5_2qmsf	True
