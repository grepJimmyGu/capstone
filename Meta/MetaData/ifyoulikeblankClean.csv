Hopefully this will save people time and energy writing the same few shows over and over. This is not meant to attack people who have made these threads, but as a resource that can be referred back to when these threads inevitably appear again.

Edit: Fixed formatting, added a couple of shows.

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for all the responses guys! I will be adding a few shows, and gave Cartoons and Sci-Fi their own category. To be clear, this is not a repository for all things TV.

I'd delete and re-submit but I'm on a phone and it was hard enough already.

By all means, it's alright to ask a question about something again if it's a specific side of things that hasn't been answered here for you,  but we're hurting the worth of this place if us TOMTers keep pouncing on all these easy requests and being little more than a handmade Last.fm. The people requesting bands you may not know, hear them out, see if something you know relates. The artists listed in the title don't need to be pre-requisites for offering suggestions. I can see how the same expectations for things like film and books that require a greater time investment isn't as reasonable, but I think we can at least make an improvement when it comes to music. 

And no, I'm not a mod. So I'm just hoping the other people who adore this sub want the same for it as me. This is just my favorite sub on reddit and I want to preserve its unparalleled function as a community. (When it comes to music we're kind of like the pertinent parts of slsk chats except they get written down and saved [thus why using the search feature here is so integral and impactful])   And no, I am not someone who feels personally wronged about not getting a downpour of suggestions with the requests I have posted; and now I'm here demanding better. I am deeply indebted to this community, for both what I get through my own postings and all that I glean from so many made by others, and all I want is to see more people helping users with the esoteric questions that so often others and I can't. There are loads of people here with deeply varying backgrounds and preferences and I am honored to have seen the generosity people possess that enables them to share the things so close to their heart.

1330603033.0	qctjq	[TV] [IYL] 30 Rock and Community, [YML] NewsRadio		62	6	8	"I just started watching this show recently, and I'm really enjoying it. It stars Dave Foley (*The Kids in the Hall*) as the news director of a radio station, who struggles to manage the personal and professional issues amongst his staff. It also stars Stephen Root (Milton from *Office Space*), Andy Dick, Maura Tierney (that actress from the 90's who was almost, but not quite, Jennifer Aniston) and the late Phil Hartman (you might remember him from such beloved *Simpsons* episodes as ""A Fish Called Selma"" and ""Realty Bites"").

The show does have a laugh track, so if you can't deal with that then it's probably not for you (also you need to be less close-minded). I compare it to *30 Rock* for a number of reasons: they're both set behind-the-scenes of a broadcast network, the main character of both is in a position of power but often feels uncomfortable there, he/she has to deal with an egotistical star and is frequently observed and advised by a wealthy corporate superior. Both shows also have a pretty frenetic pace, which I assume is endemic to their respective settings. And if that ain't enough, *30 Rock* [was originally intended to be about a news show as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock#Conception).

The comparison to *Community* is because the show takes a pretty great amount of care in avoiding common sitcom cliches, especially for it's time. As soon as the second episode, you should see a pretty huge subversion of the typical sitcom formula.

But don't take my word for it. [Watch it on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEx3tSmLMzs) and see for yourself."	t5_2sekf	True

I've seen a lot of these listed, but there are also a bunch I've never even heard of and I went ahead and made a list of everything. I seperated all of the movies into their proper catageory the best I could, but everything else is just put in a single catagory since there wasn't much to work with. Also, I added links to Netflix (*) for the titles available to stream in the US, otherwise they're linked to IMDB for the movies, Amazon for the books, Steam for the games (Wiki's for the ones not on Steam) and Music is linked to whatever album is available album on YouTube. I'll add to the list if/when other people chime in, otherwise this is more than enough to get someone started and kept busy for quite a while.

People have told me I would like Crystal Castles and MSTRKRFT, but I didn't really love them and I think the problem was it felt like the music wasn't made with any real instruments.  I definitely like to be able to hear the feeling and the playing, that's what I can really rock out too. 

In summary, anything is awesome but bonus points if its instrumental and has lively (distorted) guitar!



I've also noticed that some of these bands have albums I love, and some that I really am not into at all, so to guide your recs further:

* Ratatat: *Classics* and *Ratatat* I've listened to LP3 and LP4 and I really didn't like them much at all...

* Justice:  *Audio, Video, Disco*  Every instrumental track on here is totally awesome (Canon, Horsepower, Parade etc).  Some of *Cross* is cool too

* Phoenix: *Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix* is my favorite, with ""Love Like a Sunset"" being my favorite track.  I also like *United* but in a totally different way.

* Daft Punk: *Discovery*.  I haven't found another song I really liked by them on any other album (besides the Tron Soundtrack)

**EDIT**: I'll try to get back to everyone, but its finals week for me and there's so much great music here, so it might take a bit.  Thanks everyone"	t5_2sekf	True

It's really hard to put into words, but I'm looking for something where the author toys with everything the audience and characters think they know. While I do love The Matrix, it doesn't fit into this bizarre category, for me, because the mindfuck is covered in one very simple concept- revealed and internalized at the very beginning of the film.~~

EDIT: Scratch the above. I liked the concept of parallel worlds in The Butterfly Effect (and could have watched 10 or so more alterations of the protagonist's life). I loved the bits of The Truman Show when Truman began his escape- the whole 'one man bringing down an artificial world' thing was wonderful. And, to cap it all off, I loved the overall feel of Donnie Darko. If r/ifyoulikeblank can recommend a film based off these nonsensical ramblings, I shall be eternally grateful. 

EDIT2: Wow, that's a lot of recommendations. I think the only thing to do here is upvote everyone and then give Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a go.

The reason I haven't listed media is because I don't mind if it's books, comics, movies, other TV shows, anime, whatever - just something I might like that's similar in some way to Firefly or Cowboy Bebop. I'm especially interested in book suggestions as I rarely see people suggesting books similar to these. It's not really the jazz music or anything I like from Cowboy Bebop, I just like the space western style and the concept of a group of likeable outlaws travelling together in an interesting setting where hijinx will inevitably ensue. Both of these shows also have a great balance between drama and comedy where they're not overly serious, dark and humourless but not 'happy fun times friendship!' either.

A bit low on the gaming and D&amp;D, but besides that: I basically like all the stuff Reddit likes. I love science fiction, am a huge trekkie, have an Android phone and consider myself a browncoat.

However, in almost 32 years of my life, I have never really read a proper comic book. I think I've leafed through a Batman issue 15 years ago, but that's really it. I haven't read any of the more high brow graphic novels either.

So. What would I like? Where do I start? Someone gave me a Green Lantern: Rebirth, and I thought that was pretty overwhelming. I probably need to start elsewhere.

So, who can fix me up?

Edit: great suggestions so far. Now, if I wanted to get into the Marvel or DC universe, where would I start?

[Lights - Cactus in the Valley(Itunes session)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETS4L1S4v1w) - Debated putting this one here.  It is the lyrics/singing more so than the rest of the music that does it for me.

[The Weeknd - Wicked Games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PuAm7d0PA) - I like this one a lot, but I have not found any other songs by him that I like.  

**[edIT - Dex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWemXNsSl10)** - This entire album has long been one of my all time favorites.  

I know a lot these are pretty wildly different from each other, and that is my problem.  There is something similar between these songs that I love, but I can't quite grasp what it is. Any suggestions you think I'd like based on these would be awesome.

Before the set started the members of the band was DJing the venue for several hours, and played some very atmospheric folk/countryish music. Think music with a feeling of the dark sprawling forests, snowy plains and mountains of the north, music you could imagine played in some stereotypical bar or truckstop in Alaska. Think Jack London, some black metal, mostly acoustic (don't limit yourselves though).

I know this is pretty vague, but hopefully some of you get what I'm looking for.

EDIT:
Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised by the amount of answers in this tread, thanks to everyone who took the time to reply.
UNFORTUNATELY, after having listened some to pretty much every posted suggestion, none of it has really been what I'm looking for, though plenty of it is very nice music in its own right and some of it has been kind of in the right direction. I realize that it's very hard to explain a certain mood one is after and that it's always going to be highly subjective what constitutes ""dark/atmospheric"". Having spent some more time thinking about what I'm actually after, I realize that my original explanation might have been somewhat lacking in conveying what I'm really looking for.

I want the music to be gritty and simply processed. Imagine an old, gnarly man with a beat up guitar and a raspy voice playing in some old cabin made of logs, snow whirling outside, the air inside heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and tobacco. Imagine fur coated people sitting around a fire in the wintry forest of canada, playing moody tunes on fiddle and banjo, maybe with some occasional chanting for good measure. I want it to be rough and unprocessed and rural. 
Frankly, I'm not even sure this music exist, and if it does I'm not sure it's on the internet."	t5_2sekf	True

I'm looking for impeccably timed comedy, preferably animated but it's really not essential. The voice acting in Archer/FD is absolutely amazing and of course Arrested Development is the perfect example of fast-paced and excellently written television.

I love British humour (being British myself) so stuff like Chris Morris or Monty Python is right up my street. I'm a huge fan of across-the-pond shows like Louie, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Trailer Park Boys etc. and I also love absurdity in comedy (as long as it isn't too lolrandom) such as Adventure Time and Futurama. Foreign stuff is very much welcomed as I've never really indulged in subtitled comedy but would love to start!

This style of intentionally awful rendering has always provoked a strong reaction from me, and reminds me of growing up playing the N64 and [witnessing in-game glitches](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mMfqUKS8V4A), it feels strange watching the spasmodic deconstruction of something that is designed to look as smooth as flawless as possible. I love it.

There are other examples of this that have been used in popular media, too. The best example that springs to mind is the utterly brilliant Adult Swim cartoon [Xavier: Renegade Angel](http://youtube.com/watch?v=E70q9ojUauM) which I think was rendered using an engine similar to the ones used for games like The Sims, and makes no bones about characters limbs passing through walls accidentally and other such intentionally unintentional 3D oddness.

There's also this recent video for [Brats](http://youtube.com/watch?v=uL9jtjJ3zv0) by the band Liars.

I'd heard all of my friends in college yammer on about how great this book series and show was, but I took it with a huge grain of salt until I coerced myself to try it out. FUCKING. AMAZING. I started by watching both seasons of HBO's show like a madman and tracked down the books. Didn't take me very long to go through them.

The Avalanches have traditionally been described as a band that uses sampling a lot.

What I liked about Since I left you was that in addition to being ratehr original in its musical style, it also managed to step beyond that. Many of the albums I've listened to that have frequently been described being similar to the Avalanches have fallen short in that their albums don't really form any cohesive unity. There are just individual songs that don't play well with each other. SILY also had a nice mix of varying styles of music - hip-hop, indie rock, dance music and jazz.

For me, Since I left you was a very cohesive and visual album, and I felt the album really created a world of its own. This is unfortunately rare for and electronic album, and I wonder if any of you guys here know any other albums that are of similar style? Both on the musical style, and also being cohesive and atmospheric as an album. I feel like many albums either don't go anywhere but just meander around (Endtroducing) or are too hyperactive and miss the marks on the pacing (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome).

For reference, I've already tried the following popular suggestions (and then some):

* DJ Shadow - Endtroducing (pretty nice, but lacked in substance, and stuck to the bleeps and bloops style)
* Kid Koala - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (hyper-active)
* J Dilla - Donuts (meandering) 

Sorry for the wall of text, I hope someone has something in mind - even if you're not sure about it, go ahead and post.

Edit: Another sample, by the Avalanches: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8dPN0M5dk This is a live recording from one of their shows. I enjoy this one a lot as well - the instrumentation and sapling is fun and varied. It is a different take on their genre, as a live show instead of a cohesive album. Recommend something like this as well.

For e.g, there is this scene in The Reader that I vaguely remember where the young Michael Berg is sitting outside, late at night. And I think there was Making Time by The Creation playing behind.

I have seen Before Sunset, and I am looking forward to the new film. The Darjeeling Limited and Garden State kinda had a similar vibe, but there wasn't *that* kind of melancholia that I was looking for - the kind that's often associated with loneliness - and neither are set in Europe.

&gt;Lindsay: Hi, mom! Good news, I have the entire afternoon free.

&gt;Maeby: [working with Lucille] Well, we can go get some ice cream, Gangee. That would be fun, right?  
Lucille: I don’t think so. That chubby little wrist of yours is testing the tensile strength of this bracelet as it is.

.

&gt;Lindsay: Come on. I've suddenly lost my appetite.  
&gt;Lucille: Oh, who's going to believe that?

Jack: Women your age are more likely to be mauled at the zoo than get married.

Also, there are secondary traits to these kinds of characters; due to their wealth/success, they are oblivious to the 'real world', and this obliviousness can often reveal itself and make them seem foolish, e.g.:

&gt;Liz: Why are you wearing a tux?  
Jack: It's after six. What am I, a farmer?

I've just finished watching Whites and can't believe it was cancelled. Unfortunelty the season felt rushed. I know UK sitcoms are notorious for being 6 ep seasons but Whites felt especially rushed/short.

I'm not in the UK, can anyone fill me in what's happening with regards to comedy?

* Black Books
* Black Adder (Army Years)
* Mrs Brown's Boys
* The Thick Of It

Martin and 'The Magicians' by Lev Grossman. In a lot of the series I glanced at the emphasis always seems to be on the epic journey, or the amazing feats. This, to me, saps the humanity from the tale. The reason I love the above tales is because the characters involved felt tangible and relatable, and their desires were obviously grounded in our own world. I'm not sure how to phrase it without sounding pretentious, but I mean stories about people that just happen to include magic rather than this being the center of their world and interactions.	t5_2sekf	True

I generally prefer a concise list of your absolute favourites rather that a sprawling list of anything vaguely similar.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the suggestions liking some of the stuff I hear. 

I know that at times some of these bands I mentioned can be quite chilled out, but the stuff I like by them tends to be their more intense, abrasive stuff. Stuff like Portishead's Third and UNKLE's Psyence Fiction and some of the stuff with more overt hip hop, like some of the Tricky and Massive Attack stuff. So if anyone has suggestions for the harsher - less chilled out side of these bands then that would be much appreciated."	t5_2sekf	True

Zoldoz	19	2	26	"I watch films as often as I can and have a huge list of recommendations I need to go through. But, I would also like to start reading literature. I want to look for, as the title suggests, a book that's dark in terms of style, tone, or story and, intense in the sense of pace, theme, or detail. 


I would also like very detailed characters, whose motivations/history we can understand easily. It would also be good to have some sort of deeper theme throughout the book and great use of metaphor (I'm not a fan of the Christ metaphor but if done well I'd read it)

And as far as conflict, I enjoy a character in torment. Some sort of psychological suffering. Or they could be trying to fight that which is out of their control (the supernatural, the inevitable, or a higher authority).

Any one of these traits in a book would be fine but, the more the merrier. Some films, that I like, that fit some of these descriptions are [12 Monkeys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/), [Dark City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/?ref_=tt_rec_tt), [Oldboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/?ref_=sr_1), [The Machinist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/?ref_=tt_rec_tt), and [There Will Be Blood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/?ref_=sr_1)"	t5_2sekf	True

What else would I like?

Vocally, I enjoy well executed screaming and growls. Revocation and TFOT over do it for me frequently. Opeth and PTH are pretty perfect to my preference, because they are able to mix the traditional singing with scream/growl and use them appropriately. Clean vocal only like DT or no vocals like AAL and Impact Fuze are good too. 

Instrumentally, I am looking for motifs and reprise, variations on riffs, arches, mix meters, polyrythms, and complexity without wanking (Dream Theater's been wanking too much lately imo with their solos). And mix of genres like Impact Fuze's 'Punisher', Revocation's 'Dismantle The Dictator', DT's 'Learning To Live', and the jazzy solo over djent riff in AAL's 'To Lead You...'.

They're somewhat subdued with an ominous feeling to them, hinting at what's to come and ratcheting up the tension as the song progresses rather than in genre.  I'm mostly looking for songs with cleans vocals, but it can from a hardcore or metal band. [The Dillinger Escape Plan's Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO89M730hDY), though a good song, is an example of what I'm *not* looking for.

But, being Argentinean, I'm sure that not many of you have heard of them. Sadly, they only released three albums before they split up, but they made quite the mark in latin rock history.

Please, don't let the fact that their lyrics are in Spanish stop you from experiencing one of the greatest rock bands of the 70's. 

Some songs to get you started:

He's a big fan of film noir with sharp dialogue and various old movies. I have a fondness for modern French films of any kind and comedies.  We both like sci-fi and horror films but are pretty much open to anything.  

Some random (maybe helpful) facts:

* We're both Murakami and Vonnegut fans when it comes to literature. Had been considering My Life as a Dog since I read it was Vonnegut's favorite movie.
* I've seen one Goddard film but got slightly bored and turned it off.  I don't remember which one, but there was a hotel elevator involved.  I'm afraid it might be Breathless, which looks pretty perfect on paper.
* We're both music nuts.

So, what should we watch?"	t5_2sekf	True

Watchmen and Superman:Red Son (what would have happened if superheros were around during the cold war)

I picked up Chabon's Yiddish Policeman's Union and I'll give that a read.

I'm interested in both subtle and outlandish manipulations of history. Any media type is fine.

For those who don't watch the current series, it takes place in a mental hospital in 1964.
