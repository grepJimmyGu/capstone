So I didn't really think about the fact that since this sub is getting bigger, memes will eventually show up here. Someone posted a meme (which got caught in the spam filter, which I will deal with after we settle this), and we should probably decide whether to allow them here or not. 

**I really want to hear what you guys have to say, but I am also reserving the final call**

Right now, I am leaning towards banning memes, it's already pretty easy to contribute to this subreddit, and we really don't need them.

If there's an overwhelming demand for them however, we'll try them out for a little while and see how it goes.


Stay fabulous everyone~

Hola! Did you take our survey? Do you wanna know the results of the survey? GOOD. 

Included in each result is a graph if you're interested. The numbers below the graph represent the actual counts of the data, as kwiksurvey just gives percentages. It'll look like this:

^*Category1*:**Amount**, ^*Category2*:**Amount**, ^etc ^etc

###DEMOGRAPHICS

**[Age](http://i.imgur.com/vqdGZQT.png)**

^*13-18*:**77**, ^*19-24*:**241**, ^*25-30*:**96**, ^*31-36*:**25**, ^*37+*:**17**

Surprising absolutely nobody, the age trend of this sub follows the curve of the average redditor's age. However, there are much fewer teenaged redditors here which makes sense since sushi isn't a food always accessible on a highschoolers' budget ;). I'm very happy with the mix we have here! If you fall into the 37+ age bracket (and don't mind giving it away of course!), tell us your age! I'd be really interested to see who claims the title of /r/sushi elder (or grand poobah or whatever you'd rather call yourself). 

---
**[Location](http://i.imgur.com/OYXsTok.png)**

^*U.S.*:**338**, ^*Canada*:**45**, ^*Europe*:**48**, ^*Japan*:**2**, ^*Asia*:**3**, ^*Australia*:**5**, ^*Africa*:**2**, ^*Other*:**5**

Also fairly unsurprising is the number of US responses compared to other countries/regions. For the next survey I will probably split up Europe and Asia more. I know from conversing with a few of you that we have a decent amount of Scandinavian redditors on here (and a few Scandinavian chefs!), I would probably split up the U.S. into at least East and Western U.S. Let me know if there's another region you would like to see on a census in the future.

###NON-SUSHI STUFF

**[Favorite Non-Sushi Food](http://i.imgur.com/W8rVi0q.png)**

^*Pasta*:**227**, ^*Pizza*:**228**, ^*Fried* ^*Chicken*:**130**, ^*Hamburger/Cheeseburger*:**186**, ^*Thai*:**212**, ^*Chinese*:**250**, ^*Greek*:**132**, ^*Indian*:**148**, ^*Other* ^*Japanese*:**201**, ^*Moroccan*:**38**, ^*Other*:**62**

Guess people like pizza and pasta! Who would've thought? Moroccan seems like an oddball now that I'm writing these results, but it's what came to mind! Many of you also enjoy other Asian cuisine, especially Chinese, other Japanese foods, and Thai food! I should've added Korean food, damnit.

**[Favorite Drink](http://i.imgur.com/65NnbU2.png)**

^*Water*:**323**, ^*Tea*:**257**, ^*Clear* ^*Soda*:**81**, ^*Cola*:**138**, ^*Juice*:**172**, ^*Smoothies*:**128**, ^*Domestic* ^*Beer*:**144**, ^*Imported* ^*Beer*:**141**, ^*White* ^*Wine*:**72**, ^*Red* ^*Wine*:**102**, ^*Vodka*:**78**, ^*Rum*:**63**, ^*Other* ^*Liquor*:**100**, ^*Wine* ^*Coolers*:**15**, ^*The* ^*Blood* ^*Of* ^*Your* ^*Enemies*:**118**, ^*Other*:**35**

I am happy that so many of you like water! Or at least you're using it to chase your Vodka, Red Wine or Beer. That 's fine too. If you put tea, do you drink hot tea or iced tea? Apologies again for not putting scotch on this list. ;) Also, there are quite a few of you who enjoy the blood of your enemies. ^Excellent.

I know there were some genres I forgot (like freakin B movies!) Oh well, we have a good range here I believe.

**[Favorite TV Shows](http://i.imgur.com/jGR7nxt.png)**

^*The* ^*Walking* ^*Dead*:**111**, ^*Game* ^*Of* ^*Thrones*:**161**, ^*Sons* ^*Of* ^*Anarchy*:**25**, ^*Adventure* ^*Time*:**113**, ^*Mad* ^*Men*:**52**, ^*Duck* ^*Dynasty*:**21**, ^*Breaking* ^*Bad*:**136**, ^*Once* ^*Upon* ^*A* ^*Time*:**24**, ^*Other*:**141**

Okay okay, when I was originally doing this survey, I was planning on using a service that was going to allow me to have write in comments. When I went over 10 questions though, I had to switch to Kwiksurveys WHICH DOESN'T ALLOW WRITE IN ANSWERS WHO DOES THAT. Hence why the really random scattering of choices with an ""other"" thrown in to be a catch all. 

I'm taking recommendations for survey services for the next census though ~~whose results will be more speedy~~

**[Favorite Music Genres](http://i.imgur.com/qcY8iT1.png)**

^*Rock*:**255**, ^*Rap*:**95**, ^*Hiphop*:**125**, ^*Indie*:**184**, ^*Folk*:**96**, ^*Bluegrass*:**42**, ^*R&amp;B*:**61**, ^*Electronic/Dance*:**192**, ^*Pop* ^*Music*:**99**, ^*Country*:**36**, ^*K-Pop*:**36**, ^*Other*:**70**

This seems similar to what I see of reddit's music taste in general as well. Classical will be going on the next set of items. 

[^Also ^where ^are ^you ^K-Pop ^Fans? ^I ^will ^find ^you](http://24.media.tumblr.com/a0cc588d71a2487702579f51601d5a2a/tumblr_mnqjkaZm7X1sti0wto8_250.gif)

**[Pets](http://i.imgur.com/5BtZQ3x.png)**

^*Dogs*:**148**, ^*Cats*:**147**, ^*Lizards*:**7**, ^*Hamsters*:**4**, ^*Other ^Rodents*:**16**, ^*Fish*:**32**, ^*Small* ^*Children*:**21**, ^*None* ^*Of* ^*The* ^*Above/**I* ^*eat* ^*my* ^*pets*:**148**

Nothing too unexpected here either, *though i'm wondering if those small children are actually yours...*

###**SUSHI STUFF**

**[How Long Have you Eaten Sushi?](http://i.imgur.com/eiaHtRF.png)**

^*0-1yrs*:**27**, ^*1-2yrs*:**39**, ^*2-3yrs*:**45**, ^*3-4yrs*:**32**, ^*4-5yrs*:**45**, ^*5-6yrs*:**49**. ^*6-10yrs*:**67**, ^*10-15yrs*:**57**, ^*15+yrs*:**47**

I love a good bimodal distribution! I'm really happy we have such a mix though, it means that there's room for great discussions about different topics. Or just posting really good pictures.

---
**[How Often Do you Get Sushi?](http://i.imgur.com/YOKEMuy.png)**

^*Once/Twice* ^*a* ^*year*:**16**, ^*Once* ^*Every* ^*Few* ^*Months*:**67**, ^*Once* ^*a* ^*Month*:**100**, ^*Few* ^*Times* ^*a* ^*Month*:**163**, ^*Once* ^*a* ^*Week* ^*or* ^*More*:**62**

Of you 62 at the end, how often do you get sushi exactly? 

---

**[How Much Do you Spend on Sushi?](http://i.imgur.com/N0uQoED.png)**

^*$0-10*:**32**, ^*$11-25*:**184**, ^*$26-50*:**124**, ^*$51-75*:**39**, ^*$76-100*:**16**, ^*$100+*:**10**

I'd love to see the correlation between this question and the last one, I'm pretty sure I've had a check amount in each of these brackets over my lifetime.  

---

**[Do you Prefer Maki, Nigiri, or Sashimi?](http://i.imgur.com/B3SzfdY.png)**

^*Maki*:**112**, ^*Nigiri*:**75**, ^*Sashimi*:**41**, ^*Other/I* ^*LIKE* ^*ALL* ^*OF* ^*THESE* ^*DON'T* ^*HASSLE* ^*ME*:**178**

Nothing too crazy here, no huge gaps between choices. How many of you actually had a preference that fell into the ""other"" category instead of just being indecisive? ^heh ^heh

---

**[Favorite Maki](http://i.imgur.com/wNRbtB2.png)**

^*Spider* ^*Roll*:**98**, ^*California* ^*Roll*:**96**, ^*Philadelphia* ^*Roll*:**66**, ^*Volcano* ^*Roll*:**73**, ^*Dragon* ^*Roll*:**150**, ^*Tuna* ^*Roll*:**131**, ^*Salmon* ^*Roll*:**145**, ^*Spicy* ^*Tuna* ^*Roll*:**178**, ^*Yellowtail* ^*Roll*:**66**, ^*Alaskan* ^*Roll*:**57**, ^*Super* ^*Crunch* ^*Roll*:**76**, ^*Avocado* ^*Roll*:**68**, ^*Other* ^*Vegetarian* ^*Roll*:**27**, ^*Other*:**40**

Different rolls do vary depending on which part of the world you live in, I tried to cover most of the basic ones. Do you have a favorite roll different from the ones here? Tell us in the comments!

---

**[Favorite Non-Sushi Ingredients](http://i.imgur.com/AmIb5Ai.png)**

^*Avocado*:**278**,  ^*Cucumber*:**159**, ^*Cream* ^*Cheese*:**121**, ^*Wasabi*:**168**,  ^*Tobiko*:**97**, ^*Spicy ^*Mayo*:**173**, ^*Daikon*:**42**, ^*Sweet* ^*Potato*:**52**, ^*Tempura* ^*Bread* ^*Crumbs*:**145**, ^*Blood* ^*Of* ^*Your* ^*Enemies*:**78**, ^*Other*:**21**

Aw hell, I forgot to put ginger in here. We have lots of wasabi-heads here too! How much wasabi do you like with your sushi?

---

**[Favorite Nigiri/Sashimi](http://i.imgur.com/7ol4fM4.png)**

^*Sake(Salmon)*:**289**, ^*Maguro(Tuna)*:**251**, ^*Ebi(Shrimp)*:**126**, ^*Tai(Red* ^*Snapper)*:**70**, ^*Tako(Octopus)*:**87**, ^*Tobiko(Flying* ^*Fish* ^*Roe)*:**63**, ^*Hokkigai(Surf* ^*Clam)*:**41**, ^*Unagi(Eel)*:**177**, ^*Saba(Mackerel)*:**65**, ^*Tamago(Egg)*:**83**, ^*Toro(Fatty* ^*Tuna)*:**167**, ^*Uni(Sea* ^*Urchin)*:**55**, ^*Ikura(Salmon* ^*Roe)*:**78**

Yum yum! I'm a huge fan of Tamago personally. I've had Idako (Baby Octopus) before and it's quite interesting! The consistency was similar to a grape for me, not the taste though. Are there other Nigiri/Sashimi that you like? 

---

**[Do You Make Your Own Sushi at Home?](http://i.imgur.com/V37uEBE.png)**

^*Yes*:**160**, ^*No*:**212**, ^*No* ^*But* ^*I* ^*Have* ^*a* ^*Friend/Relative* ^*Who* ^*Does* ^*and* ^*I* ^*Eat* ^*Theirs*:**26**

It's awesome how many sushi makers we have here! If you're considering making sushi at home for the first time, there will be lots of resources that will be available to you in the near future here on /r/sushi!

We went in with low expectations based on a number of things - particularly the frequent mentions of surly service to foreigners, and some (particularly a few sushi snobs/chefs that we trust) who say it's overpriced given the short duration of the meal. 

Much could be said, but in summary, it was a truly epic meal with sublime, warm and thoughtful service. Possibly the most expensive meal i've ever eaten in terms of dollars per minute - we were there, maybe 45 minutes? Sushi service lasted 30 min or less - one amuse and then 20 pieces, pretty perfectly spaced out. Easily a top 4 sushi meal for me. 

There are definitely chefs doing stuff with sushi that is more creative (even more traditional), but this was all of the classics executed to perfection. Warm, vinegary rice, amazing cuts of fish, perfect seasoning. The aged/pickled gizzard shad was my favorite. 

Both Jiro and his son were friendly and joked around with us. Jiro came out after we were done and snapped a picture with the three of us. Unsurprisingly, most of the other diners were americans. Surprisingly, many of our fellow diners had no idea what they were doing there. At least one couple had no idea how to use chopsticks and were stabbing the sushi off the counter (and why you'd ever use chopsticks to pick up nigiri, I don't really understand). Another couple asked for soy sauce (/facepalm).

Overall a great experience. I'd actually consider going back again next time I'm in tokyo, which surprised me. Do it if you can.

**First things first**, I'm in the process of going through the spam filter and approving posts that the spambot caught, which is a lot. I'm not planning on going too far back, but if you've submitted in the past couple of weeks, you should see your post here soon.

**Second**, I want feedback from you guys, is there anything you want to see around here? More sushi pics? Restaurant reviews? Let's make it happen if you guys want it!

**Thirdly**, I set up some user flair for you guys! Right now there's maki rolls, gunkanmaki, and nigiri.  If there's a different roll you want, let me know and I'll try to make it. 

I'm not planning on really doing anything different from the way the sub's been running. Just disciplining the spam filter (I'm probably bringing on someone to help do that as well for when I'm not here), and all that behind the scenes stuff. 


Let me know if you guys want more flair or something!

This was about my 4th time doing it and I would definitely say this was only my first *successful* time. There were a lot of things I had to learn the hard way. When I researched how to make sushi,I found numerous guides on creating various types of rolls, but never how to make multiple platters in succession while still keeping it all fresh. This guide would focus on teaching an effective way of hosting a sushi party with friends/family without going into too much detail on specific recipes.

Some items it would cover:
* When to start preparing for dinner and what to prepare first
* Organizing your kitchen space &amp; fridge efficiently
* Some easy &amp; simple appetizer ideas to occupy your guests while preparing the main course

I’d try to keep it easy to read, with lots of pictures. So, what do you guys think? Any comments?"	t5_2qm24	True

We finally hit 5000 subscribers guys! We're catching up on those filthy communists at /r/ramen!^^^^/r/ramen^is^actually^a^great^subreddit^dont^hate^them



ANYWAY! I wanna do something that gives back to you guys. This subreddit has really seen some amazing growth over the past few months and it's because of all of your great contributions.  

###First off, the first /r/sushi census!

This has been suggested by a few of you guys over the past couple of months, and I figured this is the best time to do it! 

These questions came from you guys! Namely /u/sushiallday, /u/sebtownfarmgirl, /u/cupopizza and /u/wvx (who gave moral support ;)) 

It's a fairly short survey and it'd be great if you took it, I'll leave it open for a while, and I'll post results after a while. If you don't see an answer choice there, leave a suggestion in the comments and I'll add it in! 

[http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=z4thde1v9sw8frn122938](http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=z4thde1v9sw8frn122938)

###Now for my favorite part, ERMAHGERD A WIKI!

I've been trying to put in some work here and there on our subreddit wiki. I eventually want it to be a bitchin reference that we can link to whenever someone asks what a good sushi restaurant is in their area, or what's a good recipe for sushi.

Every sushi regular knows that regular patron-ship of your favorite sushi restaurant tends towards receiving special treats by the chef(s) of that restaurant. Whether its sashimi, nigiri, maki, or something else I want to know what some of your favorites are!

Here are a few of mine:

* **LIVE**, not fresh, uni sushi/sashimi. I'm talking where the urchins are kept live in a bucket of water under the bar, and the chef doesn't shear the bottom off of it to harvest the uni until right before he's ready to put it on your plate. This, my friends, is one of the finest combinations of flavor/texture that the ocean has to offer.

* Spanish mackerel(aji) sushi/sashimi. Should be served with ponzu sauce, masago, green onion, and(maybe) lemon. And no, if any of you are thinking that this fish tastes anything like the usual mackerel(saba) that you can find in every restaurant, let me reassure you that this fish is nothing like its pungent cousin. Seriously, try and find a spot where you can order this delicious fish.

* Spicy Tuna/Octopus Roll - basically your average spicy tuna roll but jazzed up by adding pieces of octopus(tako), masago, and green onion into the mix. Maybe some scallops too if you're feeling it. Octopus is one of my favorite ingredients behind the bar and, in my opinion, one of the more under appreciated fish, despite being one of the staple menu items and, thus, served basically everywhere.

* Salmon belly sashimi - If the chef at your restaurant receives entire salmon for breaking down, the meat that makes it into the display cases on the counters is usually cut from the meaty filets of the fish while the rest of the meat gets put under the counter for the chef to use for putting inside rolls and such and the bones head to the kitchen for stocks and such. Well, if your chef is nice, and you come in on the days that you know he's breaking down his fish, ask if he'll cut you a special order of sashimi from the belly meat of the salmon. The pieces are smaller so I usually cut 15 pieces of this ""mini sashimi"" as an equivalent to a 5 piece order of the standard size. Personally, I find this meat to be a lot more flavorful than the rest of the fish and usually regret that it's mostly just used for making Philadelphia rolls.

These are just a few of my personal favorites. I could definitely go on, as I've made a lot of interesting requests, but I find myself making these 4 things for myself to eat more often than anything else.

What are some of *your* favorites? I want to know what makes sushi particularly delightful for you so that I can bring those elements into my own enjoyment of the cuisine and share them with my own customers.

**EDIT:** Sometimes I also like to put scallops into the spicy tuna/octopus mix described earlier for that extra bit of texture and unctuousness.

Protip: Many of the rolls offered at most sushi restaurants start with a CA roll(imitation crab, avocado, cucumber) as the foundation, with other ingredients added to the top. Now, I've nothing against CA rolls, as their popularity in CA and this type of basic format for structuring rolls allows us to make all the CA rolls needed ahead of time so that they are rolled and ready when a customer orders and their order can be filled in a more timely manner. Having said that, the CA roll is basically the entry level roll, designed for novice sushi seekers yet unsure of what they like or can tolerate. It's pretty low on my *Chart of Ascendingly Awesome Sushi*(chart does not actually exist). Since there's basically no where to go but up, substituting almost anything else for the CA roll base will greatly enhance the flavor and mouth feel of a roll. My usual goto: the spicy tuna roll. An extra dollar or two and your boring, old regular roll is now amazing! **tl;dr** Anytime you notice a roll that uses the CA roll as it's foundation, substitute that shizz for something more interesting like a spicy tuna roll."	t5_2qm24	True

Knotthead	17	2	26	I've been getting Albacore Tuna from the local Sprouts Market and it has always been really good for my spicy tuna rolls. What about supermarket salmon?  Not the kind in the freezer section, but the fillets and steaks they have on top of ice next to the lobster tails and other fish.  I've always been skeptical of using that in sushi, and since there is no grading technique for fish here in the US I was wondering what you all thought.  Would that salmon be ok to use?  I live about 20 miles from the nearest Asian fish market here in Denver, so it’s hard for me to get salmon fillets from there.	t5_2qm24	True

I've met calamari I love at the Prado happy hour, and I've met calamari I hate in pretty much every other restaurant I've tried it in. 

Aside from that, I am a big fan of red pepper flavor over black pepper (white is a nice neutral), I find that avocado tends toward the less flavorful pasty side of foods, and I still haven't figured out why my love for salty foods and my love for fish can't equate in a fish swimming in salt, but it doesn't, and holy crap, a sunfish dredged in flour and flash pan fried is still the tastiest fish I've ever eaten.

It was roughly twice the amount of food pictured in [this image I found on google.](http://norecipes.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/07/california-roll-13.jpg)

I went to track it in my calorie tracking app but it lists a California roll has having only about 45 calories which seems way way too low, so I thought maybe it meant each portion of the roll is what it's counting.

Basically I'm wondering the terminology for serving size and a general ballpark for an entire California roll vs. one of the portions of it.

I believe I've read somewhere that you usually go for sashimi first before nigiri and maki. Then what order comes afterwards? If you are eating cooked foods as well, what should the ordering be?

And even more interesting to me is, let's say I've got a plate of different nigiris (tuna, salmon, hamachi, scallop, shrimp, ikura, etc.). Is there a proper ordering to eat these as well? I know I usually save the unagi for last because of its strong flavour, but I don't really know if there is some proper progression.

I know some people are really strict about the way they eat their food and what is ""proper"". While I like to say anyone should enjoy their food in the way they enjoy it most (eat dessert first for all I care), I was wondering what the traditional/proper way is."	t5_2qm24	True

1370838844.0	1g0yj3	I'm confused about Yellowtail and its neighbors.	LittleKey	14	2	7	"So here's what I think I know:

* Yellowtail is an ascending fish, A.K.A the various stages of its growth are significantly different in terms of taste/texture
* The term ""Hamachi"" is commonly used to specifically denote *farmed* Yellowtail
* ""Buri"" is the oldest stage of Yellowtail and is used to specify *wild* Yellowtail

Are these statements all correct?

And there are a few things that confuse me:

* I read that, in Osaka, ""Hamachi"" is the name for the second-youngest stage of the Yellowtail. I'm guessing that's just coincidence; the Hamachi we get at sushi bars is fully grown, right?
* The place where I work sells ""Kampachi"", which we call Baby Yellowtail. But I've read that Kampachi is also the name for the oldest stage of the related fish, Amberjack. These are obviously quite different, so now I don't know what fish we're selling! Anyone have any ideas as to which it might be? Or how to tell them apart by sight?
* Lastly, there's a third variety of fish called ""Yellowtail Amberjack"" (or ""Hiramasa""), right? As if it weren't confusing enough already... how prevalent is this fish?

Hello /r/Sushi! over the past couple of months we've really started to pick up in traffic, which is awesome! We've had more posts, more discussions, and we seemingly jumped from ~2800 people to ~3500 people in a short amount of time. 

That being said, I want to stay on top of things in this subreddit, and that includes knowing what you guys like here and what you want to see more/less of. Let's start with stuff on this end:

**RECENT CHANGES**

* I put some new links in the sidebar, namely the link to /u/sushiallday's awesome site ""Make Sushi""! It's been wonderful having in-house contributions like his tutorials, and I'm excited to have such a great reference in the sidebar

* I also posted a link to sushinut.com after the [great discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/16p1br/wanted_to_give_a_shout_out_to_my_friends_new/) we had in /u/war3rd 's thread. 

* I removed the link to the wikipedia page on sushi because lol. 




**POSSIBLE UPCOMING UHHH STUFF**

* I would really like to start using redditor's sushi pictures on the side bar rather then the ones I ~~egregiously steal~~ get from tumblr. If you like this idea please tell me in the comments and I'll start fleshing this idea out more. It'd probably involve having a timestamp somewhere in the picture. 

* Do you guys want more flair? Do you have a favorite roll/fish that you'd like to see as a flair? Tell me! 

* The header is kind of old, I'd love to also replace that, but I think that's a contest a little further down the road.

*While I'm really happy with the discussions we're having in the subreddit, I am considering removing the downvote button in here since we're such a small subreddit. I hate seeing en masse downvoting of people opinions in here

* **On the flipside of the previous point however,** I have no problem being more strict on comments whose purpose is more argumentative and accusatory rather than constructive. **Remember that if you want to have a discussion about the way someone enjoys their sushi, you're encouraged to take it to PM's, there's no reason to have it on someone's post**


**THOUGHTS**

I was really on the fence about doing a /r/bestof2012 contest in here, I still felt like we were too small and there would be a low contribution rate. If I am wrong in my judgment I am very sorry, we can do something during this year to make up for that. 

**Other than that, what would you like to see in /r/sushi? Stickies on certain subjects? More flair? Let me know below!**

[I love you guys](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5m1wmutqi1rwcc6bo2_500.gif)

1342131295.0	wgsft	To anyone who has worked in/hired for a sushi restaurant	BlackMantecore	15	6	6	"Hello everyone. 

There is a sushi bar in my town that I am a regular at. It’s a place that is traditional meets hip, in the sense that the menu includes quite a few traditional items yet the atmosphere is relaxed and quirky. The chef is known for hiring Westerners, both as servers and for the kitchen/bar.
I’ve decided I want to apply to work there, in the kitchen. Therefore, I was wondering if anyone who works in a sushi bar can give me some insight about what you would most like to see as far as cover letters and resume structure. 

I don’t have sushi experience but I do have kitchen experience, and the chef is also known for hiring people without specific sushi knowledge so I don’t think that should hurt me.

What trips me up though is that I have a couple of higher education degrees. I think when it comes to food service jobs, that sometimes works against me because people feel I am overqualified and won’t stick with it. However, food is my passion and I have a great work ethic. I’d also say that I tend towards being humble. I am not going to be the person who turns their nose up at cleaning the bathroom because I have a Masters. So my question is how can I best convey that say, through a cover letter? I don’t want to leave my education off of my resume because then I have a huge employment gap and I also feel that it’s a big accomplishment in my life. 


If anyone has some advice, I would very much appreciate it!

1365990851.0	1cd24e	Boston Sushi Class: Oishii Boston	h2g2Ben	11	0	9	"I know there are some other folks from the Boston area here, so I wanted to write about a nice sushi class I had today.

Oishii Boston (Sound End, Washington Street) has a sushi class the second sunday of every month. It's $50, about 2 hours, and with the head chef (I think) from Oishii, Chef Ting.

I got there a little early, and was offered water or tea (I took the tea). The rest of the group filtered in over the next ten minutes or so.

We got seated and started with some basic knife safety, discussion about how to make sushi rice, and how nori is made.

Chef Ting is incredibly affable, has some great stories, and is a good teacher. There were 10 people, so there wasn't a ton of feedback, but he'd correct you if you were doing something wrong.

We went over how to make temaki (hand rolls), inside-out rolls, and nigiri. 

As is the case with Oishii, all the fish was top notch, and they even went out of their way to accommodate folks who didn't eat shellfish by providing them with tempura vegetables while the rest of us were making shrimp tempura rolls.

I got the distinct impression that what they do in the class varies based on who's there, what the skill level is, and what he gauges the class would be interested in, meaning that you could go back a couple of months later and probably get a different experience. (Chef Ting said to mention when booking if you're a repeat customer. Also, to book the class I just called a few days in advance.)

The $50 class fee got me: A 2-hour class, Miso Soup, Three Hand Rolls, California Roll, Hamachi Nigiri, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Yuzu Sorbet, and a vodka tonic (Chef Ting ordered everyone a vodka tonic after a round of successful hand rolls.)

I'd be very interested in going back in the future, Chef Ting even teased that he would consider teaching folks how to make tempura in a future class.

I'll try to answer questions people have over the next day or so."	t5_2qm24	True

1343743396.0	xg63j	Two pieces of sushi-eating etiquette that are very important to follow.		13	5	5	"There are many rules of sushi etiquette that the conscientious person may wish to follow when eating at a traditional sushi bar, whether it be in Japan or elsewhere. Some rules are listed here http://www.sushifaq.com/basic-sushi-experience-information/how-to-eat-sushi-sushi-etiquette/ and in this info-graphic http://www.theworldsbestever.com/2009/12/10/sushi-etiquette/

Although it is nice to learn and respect these traditional Japanese rules of conduct, in my opinion there are only two truly important rules. The reason they are important is because they concern the taste of the sushi itself. (NB these two rules apply specifically to nigiri sushi.)


**1:** If you wish to use soy sauce (and you should, unless the chef has already applied a sauce) make sure you dip the fish into the sauce, not the rice. The rice is extremely absorbent and if soaked in soy will hide the taste of the fish. A thin layer of soy on the surface of the fish will suffice. (PS when dipping and eating nigiri, use your fingers. It's easier and perfectly acceptable socially.)


**2:** When putting the nigiri into your mouth, make sure it's upside-down; that is, with the fish touching your tongue. The reason for this is obvious: you can taste the delicious fish without interference from the mass of rice. My sushi-eating experience changed completely (for the better) when I was first told about this method.

1374527476.0	1iu7ym	For anyone interested I put together a list of items that can be useful to have when making sushi at home.	spastichabits	10	1	7	"I've noticed the vast majority of r/sushi subscribers are home chefs who have an interest in making sushi, so I've put together a basic list of items available on Amazon that might help to take home sushi to the next level.  
  I spent all of thirty seconds researching each individual item and they were chosen for three reasons, they were cheap, well reviewed, and they came near the top during my search.  The item is what is important not the brand, so feel free to dig a little deeper, and surely the more you're willing to spend the greater quality you will find. 

**THE BASICS**

Rice is what makes sushi, sushi.  So first and foremost a [rice cooker](http://www.amazon.com/Aroma-ARC-914SBD-Uncooked-Digital-Steamer/dp/B007WQ9YNO/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374527391&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rice+cooker)
  Unless your first name is Jiro, it's almost always best to make your sushi rice in a rice cooker, anything else will give sub-standard results.

  
While we're on the subject of rice, all sushi rice needs to be marinated, it should be marinated in a non-reactive dish, plastic or wood, a wooden bowl known as a [hangiri](http://www.amazon.com/BambooImportsMN-Sushi-Hangiri-Making-Accessory/dp/B005UOR6G2/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374524719&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=hangiri) is by far the best option and will give your sushi making an air of authenticity. Link is to a whole packet, as bamboo mats are also important, but aren't otherwise on this list. 
  

If you want pretty, well sliced nigiri you can't get away from needing a [sashimi knife](http://www.amazon.com/Sekizo-Yanagiba-Sashimi-Knife-240mm/dp/B000OIEP86/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374524843&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sashimi+knife), the long blade allows you to cut through the fish in one continuous slice so you don't need to saw through it. Linked knife is super cheap and probably not so great, but if you're only doing this as an occasional hobby, should be fine, if you're looking to step it up, I'd definitely put down a bit more money.

**Other useful items**

If you want your rolls to not looked squished when you cut them, you're gonna need a decent chefs [knife](http://www.amazon.com/Chef-Knife-SC-1-Non-stick-Sushi/dp/B0081TTY90/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_3?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374526200&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=sushi) for veggies and cutting the roles.  This is super cheap, so quality is suspect.  Again if you're serious, invest more money, hobby chefs, should be fine, and any decent well sharpen chefs knife should work.  

No matter how expensive your knife was when you bought it, if you don't keep it sharp you might as well just use a butter knife, so you'll be needing a [sharpening stone](http://www.amazon.com/Kotobuki-King-1000-K-80-Combo/dp/B00200L90I/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_3?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374526042&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=sharpening+stone)  This is a good item to have in any kitchen, sushi or not. 

If you're gonna go through all the freaking effort of making sushi at home for fucks sake get [sushi rice](http://www.amazon.com/Nishiki-Premium-Medium-Grain-15-Pound/dp/B004NRLAVY/ref=sr_sp-btf_title_1_5?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374526347&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=calrose+rice)
This is the only item on the list I'm personally familiar with, it's great rice, but any short/medium grained sushi rice will work.   

Give yourself space to work, don't try to do everything on a cutting board the size of a cd case, get a decent freaking [cutting board](http://www.amazon.com/Breville-BOV650CB-Cutting-BOV650XL-Compact/dp/B003LYZZ8Y/ref=sr_sp-btf_title_1_7?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374526557&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=wooden+cutting+board) if you don't already have one. 

Anyway this list could go on for a long time, but this should cover most of the basics, if anyone has anymore suggestions feel free to add them.  

  If anyone has any questions I'll be around for a few hours now and more tomorrow, I'll be happy to answer basic questions and give some tip and pointers for the home chef.

I'm hardly even a sushi beginner. But before i made a short story and make it long (you know, the opposite of making a long story short) let me throw this down:

TL;DR: Rarely ever eaten sushi, not a huge seafood fan, going out for sushi. What do I order?

As stated, I'm not a big seafood person. Not sure I would say ""not a fan"" - maybe that's not accurate - but growing up my parents didn't eat seafood outside of bredded shrimp. Since they didn't eat it, I didn't eat it. So I never had a chance to get a taste for it and I grew up not liking any sort of seafood.

After growing up a bit and getting out on my own I've tried to expand my palate a bit part of that has been getting into seafood from time to time. I just had scallops for the first time the other day (they were small scallops in a pea soup, but damn were they tasty!).

I have had sushi once or twice - and by had it I mean taken one piece, eaten it, didn't hate it but didn't love it. But I'm not ready to give up! A friend and I made plans to go out tomorrow night and when deciding where to go - knowing she loves sushi - I just got a craving to go for sushi. So I went with it - what the hell, right?

I'm game for trying just about anything and my initial plan was to just go in blind, but I figure it is worth asking for advice on what I should look for.

So, /r/sushi, help a beginner out?"	t5_2qm24	True

1357763413.0	169o7u	Quick question about Nori!		6	0	4	"Hey there! I had a little testrun of sushi today (i plan on doing some sushi on the weekend) and my nori just tasted wrong. It was super chewy and tasted very fishy, totally dominated the rest of the flavours. I googled a bit but the answers were completely different everywhere i went, so i thought i'd ask the experts on here! Some things that you might want to know:

The nori i used is already roasted. I found out that if you use unroasted ones it developes the exact same symptoms as mine had, so i'm not sure if mine is low quality or i should give it another roast.

I used a rice cooker and the rice turned out really nice, as far as i can tell as a newbie. However, i don't have a hangiri (can't buy one right now) and i also read that if the rice is too moist the nori can become chewy. So since hangiris are wooden i suppose that it absorbs some of the moisture and dries the rice a bit? Are there ways for me to emulate that process, in case that's the cause of my nori problem?

Those are the possibilities that i stumbled upon so far, i'm thankful for any tips!"	t5_2qm24	True

1343768114.0	xgwl3	"Concerning ""Gloop"""	OgreLord	8	2	10	"Concerning what is referred to as ""Gloop"" on this sub.

 I live in an area where its hard to find sushi whats NOT loaded with ""Gloop"" and we have many many sushi bars here (Reno Nevada area, we have 30+ sushi bars within about 50 miles and all but 1 that I know of have AYCE options but I digress). I frequent one of out local sushi bars (at least once a week) and I have become friends with both of the chefs, so I asked him about it.

 My chef told me its all about business, tailoring your product to your customer and there tastes. We must remember that these are businesses and they are there to make money and make their clientele happy. 

So for example, in my area Sushi is one of the most popular dinner options in the area and most of the sushi bars are always busy, and this is an area filled with rednecks and cowboys. if squirting some spicy mayo or teriyaki sauce on the rolls they make help them sell more of course they are going to do it! 

Okay, there I'm done with my little rant on ""Gloop"". I know this is still a controversial topic on this sub and I respect everyone's opinion about it, and that's just it, its an OPINION some like ""Gloop"" some don't. Personally, I believe when its used on the appropriate creation it can add another dimension of flavor, but it should never touch some things, EVER!

3.Boil for 10-ish minutes

4.Leave rice to cool and  add sushi vinegar.

First time eating at Sushi Azabu last Friday.  The Chef's Omakase consisted of a small sashimi plate with a handful of dishes followed by the nigiri.  The quality is neck to neck with Sushi Yasuda (NYC), but I felt Azabu edged out on the rice.  A great meal, no complaints.  

Chef's Omakase starts at $100 (you can choose a price range, probably for the nigiri).  You can also get the sushi omakase that's not on the menu for $58, but I recommend the chef's omakase!
