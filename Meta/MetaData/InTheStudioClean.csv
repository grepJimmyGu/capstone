Over time I'll try to find more. Feel free to help me out though. Next time you come across a site/band/contest/DJ/etc with stems up for grab... share it with us.

Edit: For those who don't know. ""stems"" are individual sections of a track. For example, you have a stem for vocals, strings, synths etc.. They are simply the channels bounced down to audio files.

The post have been phenomenal! In fact, modding has been extremely easy. We haven't had to remove a single post. keep it up! The only thing I could think of to make us better, would be even more submissions. 


**There's two ways we can do that:**

1) have strong regular posters. 

2) have more people posting.



I believe if we can take care of option 2, option 1 will follow suit.


Yesterday I made a little promotion post on r/music. With only 6 upvotes, it brought in over 150 new subscribers, pushing us over the 1000 mark! This shows there's definitely an interests in what were doing. To keep us going strong we just gotta spread the word. I'm going to post another promotion on **[r/music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/)**. I hate being one of those guys, but tell your friends about us. I'm lovin whats been done so far. Time to share the wealth.



**Aside:** Heres a little treat for reading my whole schpeal. 

You can find a list of tons music subreddits [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/help/faqs/Music) 

*One of the reasons 1000 subscribers is such a big deal, is because subreddits with 1000 subscribers are featured in bold, and get put to the top of the list. Now that we meet that criteria, we simply aren't old enough :(  In a few days we'll be 1 month old, and hopefully added to the list.*"	t5_2ua83	True

The genre doesn't matter. From Aviccii, to Justin Beiber, to Plies, all are welcome. Don't downvote because you don't like the genre/artist. If the video contains terrible technique or general lack of skill that would be a decent reason to downvote. 

I've been stalking people like Ryan Leslie, and Future Music Magazine for new ""behind the scene"" videos for years now. So next time you come across an inspiring video related to music production, show us some love and post it here.

Any suggestions?

1374693435.0	1iz4e4	Hi guys, we're Equipboard, wanted to introduce ourselves to some fellow studio gearheads :)	entrigueme	20	19	7	"Hey guys!

We're [Equipboard](http://equipboard.com), an early stage startup that aims to be the place to go to for ""who uses what to hone their craft, and why."" As an example, we recently added Steve Aoki's equipment board: http://equipboard.com/pros/steve_aoki 

Ideally we'd love Equipboard to be a place to turn to for inspiration, and to discuss people's gear selection, including discussing what the pros are using, signing up to get pro gear updates, showcasing what *you* are using, etc.

We'd love to hear any thoughts you have on the site - if you do (or don't) find it useful, or if you can think of anything that would improve your experience. We sincerely hope you guys enjoy poking around a bit!


**edit:** for the sake of transparency, just wanted to mention that we are compensated for purchases made  through some of the links on the site"	t5_2ua83	True
