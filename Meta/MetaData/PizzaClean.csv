I just wanted to share a couple things with you folks. I've worked in several pizzerias over the past 10 years, and while my current job isn't in the same field, pizza is still one of my passions. I learned a lot about pizza, churning out as many as 200-300 day, and figured some of you might appreciate some tips.

**Dough:**
If your dough is too much like flat bread, or too cracker-y, try and start your yeast; warm some water (90-100 degrees, warm to the touch, not hot), add your yeast, and sprinkle a small amount of sugar over the yeast. Allowing the yeast to sit will let it bloom, speeding up the yeasts production.

If you're struggling with finding the right consistency, try and make your dough at least a day before - 2 days is optimal. Letting the dough rest allows the gluten in the dough to bind, resulting in a chewier dough. Using a higher gluten flour, such as King Arthur's bread flour also helps.

I typically use sea salt and beer when making dough as well; sea salt is a flavor preference, while the beer gives the yeast production a bit of a kick. I typically use a Lagunitas IPA, or Sam Adams Boston Lager, but anything not too dark will work. Using a mixer is almost a must, unless you're Lou Ferrigno. Using the hook attachment, and setting the speed to the second notch for 15 minutes will beat the shit out of that dough. After letting it sit overnight, halve the dough, and knead the halves. Stretching the dough should yield in a thin, stretchy membrane that is slightly transparent. This is how you know your dough is going to be awesome.

The recipe below is taken from Alton Browns recipe, as its the same basic recipe used for most any basic restaurant dough.

*Base dough:*

* 2 tablespoons sugar

* 1 tablespoon kosher salt

* 1 tablespoon pure olive oil

* 3/4 cup warm water (substitute 6oz of beer for awesomeness)

* 2 cups bread flour / high gluten flour

* 1 teaspoon instant yeast

**Cheese:**
I use a mixture of about 70% whole milk mozzarella, and 30% jack cheese. Skim milk is for babies, as it by definition carries less flavor than whole milk, and melts worse. The addition of the jack cheese gives the mozzarella some bite in both texture and in flavor. Once the combination is evenly distributed on the pizza, I sprinkle a little salt over the cheese. A little, not a lot - I still use sea salt, and too much salt is a fine line to cross, depending on the brand of cheese/salt you're using. For reference, I use Clover cheese, and Trader Joes sea salt.

**Sauce:**
If you're like me, I go for a less is more approach with sauce. I dislike sweet sauces, and certain sauces don't sit well with me, typically sauces made with tomatoes bathed in citric acid. When I make sauce, I try to use either 6 in 1, or San Marzano. Both have limited amount of ingredients, so you're free to really choose a flavor profile, and both do not use citric acid as a preservative. 

*Base Sauce:*

* 1 Can 6 in 1

* 1 Tbsp Basil (fresh, if possible)

* 1/2 Tbsp red pepper flakes (A couple dashes of franks red hot also works)

* 1 Tbsp Onion Powder

* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil

* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder - the difference between most marinara and pizza sauce is the amount of oregano, and garlic in the sauce. Marinara is fine and dandy, but it has no place on pizza!

* 2 tbsp Oregano (less is more with oregano)

* Salt and sugar to taste: I typically start with a little sugar, just enough so that I can barely taste it in the sauce. From hear, begin salting the sauce gradually until the saltiness and the sweetness can both be distinctly tasted. Less is more!

Parmesan cheese can also be added, if you're into that.

Heat sauce up on low - medium heat for 20 minutes, let cool, and the let it sit over night.

**Baking tips:**
If you're having issues with the pizza's doneness, or uniformity, you're probably running into a couple of issues; thickness of dough, topping dispersion, and baking heat.

In reality, most restaurants have ovens which can far exceed the 500-550 oven temp most people have in their kitchens. The faster you can cook a bread, the more a crust can develop. If you've got an oven at 800 degrees, its going to create a better base for sauce and toppings than a normal oven can ever hope to achieve alone. Invest in a pizza stone, set your oven to its max heat for about an hour prior to cooking, douse the stone with a heavy amount of fine corn meal, and set the pizza directly on the stone. You'll be surprised at how much this elevates your pizza - from pretty good to fucking awesome.

Also, in regards to sauce and toppings - you want to cover the pizza in sauce, but you don't want to drown it. Ladle about a cup of sauce onto a 14"" shell, and with a spoon, coat the pizza by moving the spoon in a spiral moving out from the center. It's fine if you see a bit of crust beneath, as the pizza heats up, the toppings cook, and the cheese melts, the sauce will level out.

In terms of cheese, again you want to cover the pizza, but give the pizza room to breathe; drowning your pizza in cheese is apt to give it a soggy center, as the cheese will pool in the middle. I go for 14oz, give or take, of shredded cheese on a 14"" pie.


This won't guide everyone to the perfect pizza, but I hope it helps some along the way. If anyone has questions, I'd be glad to help out if I can."	t5_2qlhq	True

Good beginner sauce/dough/pizza recipe(s)?

But it's real NY thin crust. We use a brick oven to cook, and a Hobart mixer to make the dough. 

We use [mondako flour](http://www.pfmills.com/mondako-flour-products-2.php), and [75 canola/25 extra virgin oil](http://www.amazon.com/Canola-Extra-Virgin-Olive-Blend/dp/B0050IMHW6). the rest is pretty generic ingredients. 

The recipe is for 25 pounds, I doubt any of you will need 25 pounds, so just reduce the ingredients proportionately to the amount you want. 

Also when mixing, it's best to use a powered mixer, don't mix by hand. Also after the fifteen minutes rising on the table, knead it into 15 ounce dough balls and that makes 16"" crust. 

And **refrigerate overnight**

My wife made a cake that looked like a pepperoni pizza that she wanted to serve in a pizza box and also wanted to hand out pizza boxes with little prizes as goody bags. So we called around to a few places and nobody would give us around 15-20 unused boxes. Finally we called Papa John's and, not only did they give us the pizza boxes, but they also discounted our order for the party (8 large pizzas, half pepperoni and half cheese). Gourmet and artisanal pizzas are great, but when you need some basic pizza for a kids' party, great customer service goes a long way.	t5_2qlhq	True

1373372777.0	1hxiju	First Pizza from my Uuni oven (album inside)	andrew_holmes	37	6	13	"I posted a while ago about the kickstarter Uuni pizza oven.  Well, it arrived last week and it's fantastic.

The oven gets hot very quickly.  There's maybe 15 to 20 minutes after lighting the oven to having the deck temperature over 400C. 

Air is sucked in the back by a small fan, which feeds the fire.   The forced hot air circulates in the cooking chamber, and exists through some holes in the front of the deck by the door, then travels under the deck and  back outside through another set of holes at the rear of the Uuni.  

The album shows today's lunch:

This is the second pizza cooking attempt.  The oven came with a small bag of hardwood pellets, and by the time that I'd fired the oven to condition it, and cook a pizza, I was out of pellets.  I could see that they were going down quickly so didn't stop to take photos.

27Kg of pellets arrived yesterday, so now I've got time to take photos.

Today's pizza was great; a little charred because it cooked quicker than I was expecting (went in to turn it around after 90 seconds, but it was already done!).

TL;DR - New pizza oven cooks pizza, and it was great.
