Question, Hypothesis, Prediction, Method, Test, Analysis, Conclude.

**In Mythbusters they subtly follow this perfectly**
****
Question: The myth. Is this possible, what will happen when, etc.

Hypothesis: The hypothesis is what happened in the myth, the real world story.

Prediction: They often make a prediction as to what they think will happen

Method/materials: They state exactly what they are doing and with what materials

Test: Normally a small scale test

Analysis: They analyse what they've done and what happened. (Talk about it after the test)

Conclusion: When they conclude they normally go up to a larger scale, and remark on early outcomes and what they should do to make he test better.
****

**EDIT** I want to make something clear here.  I realize the show is for entertainment purposes only.  So is 'Modern Marvels', 'Through the Wormhole', or 'Wonders of the Universe'.  But the show (at least until now) was still a learning type of environment, answering questions like ""how can someone escape from a sinking car"", or ""are bulls aggravated by the color red"", or ""Can steak be tenderized with explosives?"".  These conversations would come up at a bar over beer and you can discussed a ""well, on mythbusters they tested it this way and this happens..."".  Yesterday's episode had no new material and was just a plug for a different Discovery Channel special.  That's what my disappointment was. "	t5_2qtxd	True

Gimli_The_Dwarf	68	17	17	"Sorry for the abrasive title, but a large number of people have been trying to get *someone* from Mythbusters to acknowledge this ever since it aired. Seeing Adam comment on it in his AMA makes my head explode. 

THEY DID IT WRONG

The Myth is that when you break a ship's mooring line, the snap back can seriously injure or even kill you. MB tested it and couldn't even get a bruise on the dead pig they used. 

Because they tested the wrong thing. 

In their eagerness to dial it to 11, they got the strongest line they could find, which was wire rope. The only problem is that mooring lines aren't wire rope - they're nylon. That's why it's called ""Synthetic line snapback."" Hemp ropes don't do it, Kevlar ropes don't do it, and wire ropes certainly don't do it. 

Nylon is used for mooring lines *because* they stretch - it gives some buffering to the force holding the ship to the dock. If they just broke, then a good solid wave could rip a ship off the pier. 

If you need a mental image of this - it would be like testing if a rubber band can hurt your finger when it breaks, and testing the myth by pulling on a length of cotton string until it broke. 

By the way, I forgot - the reason they used wire rope is that wire rope is used in aircraft carrier arresting wires, and that's what they focused on for this myth. The thing is - the snap from an arresting wire comes from the huge tensioned steam engine holding it tight, not the rope snapping. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX19sAudmic) is a video of what it looks like when an arresting wire fails. 

But an 8"" nylon mooring line snapping puts that to shame for speed and damage. "	t5_2qtxd	True

To take these pictures, 100 participants put their hands on a black surface with a small black peg between the pointer and middle finger.

Then, 12 people had the back of the hands photographed. These people had the small black peg between the middle and ring finger. Then, this middle/ring combo picture was placed next to 9 pointer/middle combo photos.

My question is, Could that peg placement have tipped off the participants? Sorry if this doesn't make any sense or is a silly question.

Clarity: It was indeed the guesser's hand plus 9 random people's hands. Also, I could see the black circle between the fingers, therefore I would assume the guesser could see it also.

Photos, courtesy of /u/willdogs: http://imgur.com/a/Jqdst These pictures demonstrate the ease of recognizing where the peg is located on the hand.

Ok this is the official Mythbusters account, looks like your average spamming TV show account, times the shows start, links to the website and all that good stuff.

https://twitter.com/donttrythis
But Adams account is full of very similar tweets lately, tweets about what time the show starts get retweeted by the official account very quickly it seems. The PR speak ""mythbusterstour.com"" tweets look odd as well.

https://twitter.com/JamieNoTweet
Jamie has very similar style tweets to Adams show start times tweets all saying the same **""tune in at 9/8c!""** line each time, not something someone would naturally say if they were just tweeting about the show. And again he has the same style ""mythbusterstour.com"" tweets.

I don't see similar what i'd term ""official show spam"" style tweets from Kari, Grant and Tori anyway.

So what gives? Does someone else at Discovery have access to their accounts to post that stuff? It can't all be them doing it right?

1371322805.0	1gev4c	I'm a NHTSA crash safety tech. I totally called the Crash Cushion myth. (Spoilers!)	hapaxLegomina	28	5	12	"In this myth, Adam and Jamie crashed their giant dumptruck into a Volvo station wagon in a classic t-bone configuration. They compared the G load and injuries between a SynDaver in the back seat by itself and a SynDaver in the back seat between two simulated obese people.

Spoiler: The SynDaver between the obese passengers suffered wildly more extensive injuries than the lone passenger.

I knew what a real-word result would be (other people, fat or not, contribute to injuries. They don't act as protective cushions,) but I totally expected the lack of bones in the ""big dudes"" to throw the test off. I'm pleasantly surprised to see that it didn't!

Other occupants are potential injury sources in any crash, and that's one of the many reasons it's a bad idea to sit on someone's lap in car. In fact, some newer model year SUVs have an inboard seat-back mounted airbag that deploys in side engagements when there's a passenger in the front seat. The reason is that we started seeing head-to-head injuries showing up in these side engagement crashes. People bounce around like pinballs during a crash. It's good to have airbags, cushy seats and stretchy restraint webbing around you. It's not so good to have heavy, high-momentum, bone-filled people around you."	t5_2qtxd	True

1375272736.0	1jezvv	Myth Request - Breaking the Crossbar in Football (Soccer)	ChrisDnmnm	37	14	12	"This is probably a long shot, but this myth has been bugging my mind ever since I was a kid. 

When I was a kid in the 90's one of the top football players was the Brazilian player Roberto Carlos. He played for some of the best clubs in Europe and was famous for his tremendously powerful and precise free kicks.

I believe it was based on the power of his free kicks that the myth was born. The myth went that he, at some point in his career, kicked the ball with such force that it broke the crossbar. So, it was not just the goal falling apart because of poor construction, but the crossbar actually cracking, break, being destroyed, due to the shear stress. 

Now, I've never seen the mentioned kick; not even after the birth of YouTube, Google, etc.. But, searching the web, I can see that I am not the only one who's heard of this. Furthermore, I believe that anyone who has played football, or is interested in football, have heard of either this myth or similar. 

So, is it possible to break the crossbar with a football from a free kick? A lot of factors play into this myth: wind (air resistance), distance (minimum 18 yards), material of the football, material of the crossbar, friction (is the goal fixed into the ground), and of course power. Can it be done? And, can it be done by a human?"	t5_2qtxd	True

Shifting from 3rd to reverse at 45mph is not a great feeling that will leave 2 very nasty black marks and smoke rolling behind you

i have personally done this on accident in an old 78 ford truck with a sbf 400m/c6 auto transmission i daily drove for quite a while, now i know there aren't as many vehicles these days running down the road but there still are several antiques that like mine (due to worn out motor mounts) require an occasional check to make sure you're in the right gear after a quick takeoff from a stop sign that might tweak the linkage enough to cause a unwanted downshift

Instead it does Cooling a Six Pack, Is Yawning Contagious, Hollywood on Trial, Son of a Gun, Shop til you Drop, and Mythbusters Revealed. All in season one which don't start showing up til season 3.

If they had positioned the body more towards the front of the board and taken an 'all fours' posture, the thrust vector would have been directed through the center of mass and caused less torque.

To be fair that's NOT what Jamie said. In the context of the episode in question he was referring to the impact on the car between the two trucks would be the same as if it hit the wall at 100mph. In the test that was done with the swinging hammers and the clay, the clay balls were measuring the impact on the outside vehicles, the trucks.

1355396420.0	14s3lm	My Issue With The Coffin Punch	edders	4	1	1	"SO! I've now watched the ""Coffin Punch"" episode 3 times and the same thing is still bugging the ever living crap out of me. In the episode they're testing to see if the ""Kill Bill"" coffin escape can be done. The scenario is: a person trapped in a coffin 6 feet under has to punch a hole through the lid of the coffin from about three inches away and then climb out and through the dirt to the surface.  
Since Grant takes charge on the myth, they use a robot to do the punching to keep all the punches consistently the same strength... and the same 3 inch distance. NOW! I don't know about you, but I already see a MASSIVE flaw in this approach. Besides the fact that people don't generally punch the exact same every single time, they also don't punch at their target, they try to punch THROUGH their target...  
SO! Even after seeing that the very first punch the robot throws cracks and breaks the wooden top of the coffin, the fact that a few hundred punches later, the robot hasnt broken past the 3 inch mark (The distance the robot is set to), this test some how ""proves"" it is impossible for someone to break through the top of the coffin...  
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU ALL, am I just crazy? Or did they actually screw it up? And did they ever return to the myth in some episode I have yet to reach?  
tl;dr Grant's obsession with Robots ruined a test"	t5_2qtxd	True

All it takes is 220 feet. :-("	silentmajority2012	1	1	2	"I am used to half assed science and obvious answers/stupid myths (i.e obvious hoaxes but hey let's play) from the Mythbusters, more so as the seasons progress, but I found this segment genuinely upsetting and I am surprised that it aired.

The show is produced in the Bay Area and anybody with half a Google knows that [hitting water from a height of 220 feet is fatal unless you land exactly right](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013fa_fact?currentPage=all). The stats don't lie and the causes of death are frightening. Here's [the reality](http://flowingdata.com/2009/07/28/suicides-by-location-on-the-golden-gate-bridge/) (original link is dead).

So many shows since they got popular are over-the-top dumb and pure entertainment but there is fun stuff there in what they do. That's why I watch (and get angry when they are so dumb: surely that is part of the plot). But this was a very simple ""myth"" that, on average, at least twenty people prove every year and have since the bridge opened. This is right in the ""Mythbusters"" back yard. I have no idea why they would go there. They put pigs in heavy bags (obviously the air inside the bags would act as a cushion).

If you haven't yet then go seek out [The Bridge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799954/) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_\(2006_film\))). It's very moving and absolutely horrifying.

Dr_Wernstrom	4	7	1	"I stopped watching years ago when they switched to 2 myths per show. It was on the other night so I watched a newer one. It had to do with dodging a snipers bullet, water VS concrete and duct tape airplane. 

It left me thinking that Jamie and Adam are either getting really dumb or that the producer of the show is having thing do pointless stuff just to get people to complain and get more buzz going.

dodging a snipers bullet for one could be possible. They just failed to test any thing in that myth correctly. 
No night testing ( fire can be seen better at night no way ).  THe USMC has been using Night vision scopes since Vietnam. 
Shooting at 500 yards max they kept talking about how far that was but 500 yards with lapua 7.62x51 or 8.6x70 round, a trained shooter and spotter 500 yards is to close.  one of the longest confirmed kills was over 2000 yards with a .50 cal  at 1600 yards with a 7.62x51 it takes almost 4 seconds for the bullet it hit the target. You need to lead the target if they are walking or you will miss well no** technically they will have dodged the bullet simply by walking.** They will hear it hit then hear the shot then run like hell.  

Speaking of walking why did they not test out side profiles? 

TLDR: no night testing, no side profile testing, distances way to short. 

As far as the other 2 ""myths"" Will adding a ~~Duct tape~~ stronger and lighter material to an airplane then what they had 60 years ago work? 

It was less the 10lbs and they made it sound like a big deal, I hope the guy flying did not have a big lunch or it is a no go. 

Concrete thicker then water? ( said in a zoidberg voice )  hold on concrete will do more damage then hitting water when at the same height. I think every one already new that. The actual myth is can water do the same damage as concrete which is yes. jumping from 200 feet and landing in water is the same as jumping 40 feet and landing on concrete.

What is my reason?

Look at the height they are at when they are swinging - the cage is low enough to the ground (at the neutral position) for people to reach the cage. When they climb up and grab the flag, they let go and don't immediately drop. Instead, they swing casually - and when the cage hits the neutral position again it is now quite high off the ground.

I don't believe they climbed the rope mesh, I think the cage was being lifted and they simply kept holding themselves to the rope mesh.
