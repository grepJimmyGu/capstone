It's probably the reason TP is currently my fav game as Epona in that is awesome. Fighting on horseback, vaulting on/off and looking badass riding round the field.

I loved WW but there was something missing. I didn't enjoy SS as much but imagine how good Epona would look in that art style. OOT was my first game and she seems necessary now.

Plus, Epona seems *way* underrated in this subreddit - give her some love.


Anyone with me?

**Edit: to be clear, I am talking about the 'big screen, 3D games' rather than the handheld or older ones. It seems like a lot of what is talked about on this sub are OOT, MM, WW, TP and SS so I didn't think to clarify... My bad!**"	t5_2r61g	True

So our attempts at making r/Zelda a [spoiler free zone](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/lxvpl/state_of_the_subreddit_spoilers/) is looking to [be futile.](http://memegenerator.net/instance/11573792)

Now that the game has been released in NA people are posting everything they can that makes a reference to almost any part of the game at least 14 hours in. This subreddit was just hammered yesterday with over 50k impressions up from last weeks 30k a day impressions. Submissions are through the roof and there is no attempt to even put [SPOILERS] in your threads. Us mods can't keep up, plus this entire subreddit would be in black bars if we did.

So please take caution when browsing this place. There is no feasible way for us to really keep up with the amount of spoilers busting through the seams. It is most likely only going to get worse as people get further into the game. And like we said in the original post we don't want to limit discussion!

But! Please try to be mindful and use discretion if you make a comment. Use spoilers tags when absolutely possible in your comments. Using them in your title doesn't seem feasible for the time being, but if you can, fantastic!

But please don't put actual spoilers in your title. We'll just be removing the post if you blatantly put a spoiler in your title. If we have the bandwidth we will black out the title and not remove it. Right now most if not all have been quite considerate and made their title's vague which we are very thankful as mods and as readers!

That's all. Just a status update for those curious about what's been going on the last 24 hours.

Edit: Just to clarify here are some examples on what we will still be editing. We're not going to edit [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/mj670/100_of_my_deaths_in_skyward_sword_are_because_of/)  or [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/mjqah/scumbag_zelda/) as the titles were vague. Click at your own risk when you see things like this if you don't want to be spoiled. Threads like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/mkdj8/link_gets_his_sail_cloth_from_zelda/) will be edited to remove the spoiler from being seen. I edited that post with CSS. Before we were asking for all posts to have a [SPOILER] tag in front of the thread. But if the person it talking SS be prepared to be spoiled and avoid the post. Like I said we don't want 90% of the front page to be black barred. 

As always. Report posts and comments that have blatant spoilers and we'll take care of them."	t5_2r61g	True

Well my favorite is The Song of Storms for a very important reason. 

After I beat a hard dungeon or if I just find myself at a resting point in my quest, I pull out the ocarina and play The Song of Storms.

Far away in the castle I know Ganondorf is waiting for me.

Confident, thinking I'll never survive to see the castle gates

 But when you finally gain control of Link, you start from a top-down perspective in what seems like the 2D games before it...

..then when you walk out the door, there's this epic moment where Link steps out onto his little porch and you finally get to control the game in a 3D environment.

Then the FIRST THING you do is climb down onto another plane of space.
