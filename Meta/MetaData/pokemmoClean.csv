**Installation:** First and foremost, [I will not tell you how or where to get roms, that is illegal.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=pokemon+fire+red+rom)


Now then, you need to download the files provided from [here](http://pokemmo.eu/downloads/)

They are in a .zip file, you will need to open that and move all the files inside into their own folder.

Of the files you downloaded, you should have gotten an empty folder called ""roms"". This is where you will place your copy of Pokemon fire red (Which should be a .GBA file, by the way).


Once the .GBA file is in the roms folder, run PokemonMMO.exe and you should be all set.




**In Game Information:**


*  What is a GM/Admin/CM/Moderator/Ect.

The Administrators, Game masters, and Community moderators are the staff of PokemonMMO. They are there to assist you in any way they can. [Before asking them to fix something, please try searching the help forums instead.](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/forum/9-support/)

[Check here for more guides!](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/forum/26-guide-tavern/)


And of course try to ask your questions here!



* Does this game work for Mac users?


This game is not currently supporting Mac osx. However there are two fixes available.

[An app which launches the game for you courtesy of Kibook.](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/topic/174-mac-os-x-app/)



[And an .exe patch from reddit user mtwede.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/z6sy3/amazing_a_pokemon_mmo_that_actually_works_and_you/c6282rn)



* How do I get my Pokemon to follow me? 
 

You need to place a pokemon soul silver or Heart gold .NDS file into your roms folder. **Then drag the pokemon from your party list to the ground next to you.**

* How can I make my game look better?


By installing the updated textures so generously provided by Darkshade.
Found [here.](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/topic/786-firered-with-updated-graphics/)
*(Side note: By having the Soul silver or Heart gold roms, all pokemon sprites are updated. moves are not.)*


* What works and what doesn't?


Currently, some features of the story are disabled, but will be added soon. (This includes the game corner, ect.)

Pokemon battle, Evolution, trades, 1V1 Duels, Trainer battle, EV's, and many moves are included.



* Do the battle mechanics follow later Gens, or are they Gen III?



All battle Mechanics are of Gen III, that means that the Physical/Special split has not occurred. Abilities are unimplemented, however they are planned and will be under the Gen III stats.



* Do trade evolutions work?


Yes, **however hold items do not,** so Pokemon who evolve through hold item trade do not evolve yet.


* How do I Trade/Duel/Friend someone?


Right click them.



* Is this game the same as Pokemon Fire Red?


Pokemon MMO follows the same basic plot as Fire Red. All locations, Enemy trainers, events, and items are the same. 



Pokemon include the exclusives from both versions.  For example, you would normally have 25% chance to find Ekans, but now it is a 10% chance, though Sanshrew is also included.


* How do I access my Friend list?


Type /friendlist Into chat.


* How do I make the chat stay solid all the time?

Click the small lock icon, found on the bottom right of chat.


* Where is POKEMON/ITEM/EVENT?


Have a look through [this](http://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml)



* What about legendaries, and shinies?


You **cannot** find **legends** in the wild, however, some may be included as prizes in upcoming pokemon tournaments. *(Please note that this is still being discussed.)* [Find info on and register for upcoming tournaments by signing up at the official forums.](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/)


**Shiny Pokemon are included** and are encountered as normal, begging for one will get you nowhere. People are finding them all the time, be sure to try trading for them!

Beware of those scammers and look for suspicious behavior for example if they act  like they dont have a lot of time and need to get the trade over quickly.

For now you can't report these scammers but you can inform others in the Trade chat of the Names of these Scammers.

When someone is offering a shiny Pikachu beware, it could be a Trap. 

One of these scammers is /**NurseMaddi**/Do not trust this person.

Hi guys.
Reddit is one of my favorite communities overall. Especially for PokeMMO.

Used to, forums have been my way of connecting to others and talking about a specific subject, game, etc. and share my thoughts. However, that's just not possible on the forums for PokeMMO.

Being completely blunt, I see the forums as just being a sewer of people with zero communication skills and people who frankly wouldn't even survive trolling 4-chan.
It's really sad to see a community that could be a lot of fun to be involved in be full of literally just assholes. I even received a bit of unnecessary hostility from moderators. Granted, that may just be because of the amount of things they have to do, but it's still not how normal forums are ran.

I don't mean to offend anyone - if you're a decent human being at least, I'm probably not referring to you here.

So please, keep this Reddit alive and friendly, PokeMMO needs it."	t5_2tt0u	True

1374696358.0	1iz8j3	Becoming Gym Leaders	danielmontilla	33	11	19	"Okay, this may have been proposed at some point before, but I didn't see it, so here it goes:

I have an idea for how to make the end game more fun, especially if you're like me and you've beaten the first gen games more times than you've had sex.  (I'm not saying I don't have a lot of sex, I'm just saying I've beaten Pokemon Red A LOT.  Bad analogy.)  Anyway, I was thinking about how everyone really wants to become a gym leader in the hand helds.  It's like a long standing dream, and really, with some hard work and creativity we can totally do that in PokeMMO.

All it takes is this:

* Try to get your name out about being a leader by telling people who/where you are when you log in.

* Always battle in the same place so that people know where to look for you.

* Pick a theme!  Make a cool one.  It doesn't even have to be all dragon or all fire.  I was thinking of an all Eevee evolution team for me.  But you can do something like an all starter line up.  Maybe even copy the pokemon other NPC gyms have, but train them the way YOU would train them.  Hang out in their gym, too!  Just ignore the fact that there's a Brock avatar next to you.

* BREED!  Here's the it gets tricky and kind sorts out who really wants to be a leader and who doesn't.  Well, not tricky, just work.  Naturally, since we can't give out badges I was thinking we would give out Pokemon.  Naturally not your main team line up, but a good Pokemon that embodies the theme you chose for yourself.  If I did Eevee evolutions, obviously people who beat me would get an Eevee.  All starters?  Let the winner choose a starter.  Dragons?  Dratini or something.  Be creative about it!  And since other people can't name the Pokemon think of a unique name for them.  Not ShitFace or TurdGoblin or anything, just something to show that it's a legit Gym Pokemon.

* Be okay with losing!  People are SUPPOSED to beat gym leaders!  That's the point of Pokemon.  Don't throw the fight, but don't be pissed off if you lose.  You'll ruin it for everyone.  Just lose like a sportsman/woman and give them their Pokemon.  Maybe give them a few words of encouragement or advice.

* Battle for your spot.  If you and someone else decide they both want to be the Ice Gym leader, then battle for it!  Whoever wins gets the be leader (There, at least.  Theoretically you could always just go somewhere else and be a leader in that area).

* And last idea, just off the top of my head, maybe we should choose a server.  Maybe server 4 will be the Gym server and anyone who wants to battle REAL Gym leaders can go have their adventure there.

* Actually, one more thing.  I don't know about leveling.  I'm thinking since this would really be more for end game players, you should max out your Pokemon line up.  That way everyone knows what level to expect and you don't have to worry about your Pokemon getting TOO string after a while and have to take them out of your line up.

Who knows, maybe if this takes off we can have a real Pokemon League that only trainers who have beaten all the leaders can compete in.  A huge tournament once a year or something.

Anyway, these are all just ideas, if you like them let me know and maybe we'll try to make it happen.  And honestly, people could already be doing this, I haven't checked.

1365008101.0	1blij1	Discussion: What would it take to make PokeMMO a game you would play more frequently?	b0b_d0e	29	10	48	"In light of the last thread concerning making /r/pokemmo a place were discussion can take place, I thought maybe I should start some manner of discussion myself then :) 

One thing I have seen that is a semi popular sentiment among casual players like me is that ""PokeMMO is the kinda game where you only play it once after an update to catch all the new pokemon and then never play it again until the next update"" I suppose people that love to do 50s battles will continue to play to get that perfectly ev trained correct natured starmie or what not, but I couldn't honestly care less about battling. The things that always drew me into pokemon games was a sense of adventure and a sense of ""Gotta catch em all.""

So what else would motivate someone to play the game? One thing I think would be lots of fun is to take the concept of secret bases in RSE or the underground from DP would be lots of fun! Setting up traps for others and hanging out in the underground would be very fun I'd think. Would adding in non cannonical pokemon things be interesting such as a pokemon ""raid"" where each person can only bring in one pokemon and together the six of you form a ""party."" I haven't really thought more into the semantics of that, but its more of something to start a discussion on the matter really.

However, instead of trading back my level 20 something Alakazam, he traded me his lvl 50 something one. I feel really bad because now he's stuck with my sucky one and I have his good one that he worked hard on. If anyone know who this trainer is (maybe he has a reddit account), or if you just see them in the game, tell them that Antoeknee has their Alakazam and wants to meet at the pokemon centre where we did our initial trade. thanks, I hope this doesn't get down voted."	t5_2tt0u	True

Some ideas I have in mind: 

* Different level battle nights

* Single/Double battle nights

* A subreddit with official rules and such?

1. Maybe I'm just not paying attention enough, but how does the time system work?  I know it a 24:00 hour system but what is the basis for the time? Eastern, Western, not even US time zone?  Or none of these?

2. My friend and I wanted to basically play this together so can that be easily done?  like we'll find each other as long as we're on the same channel?

3. Is there any way to check another players stats?  Like what pokemon they're holding or do you just have to kind of go in blind and hope you can fight them?  Same goes with trading.  Someone asked to trade and it just said ""Do you want to trade?""  I said no because I couldn't see what they wanted to trade.  But is it like, i click ""Yes"" and it brings us to a trade screen to select what we trade?

4. So is there no benefit to challenging other trainers other than just for the fun of it?  It's still cool, and i know you don't get money/xp, but it'd be cool if there was an incentive (even though i suppose it could be abused if that were the case.)

thanks for any help.  i know these questions probably become more clear as you just play the game but i haven't really played pokemon since gold/silver so there are a lot of new things to learn (EV and whatnot.)

Update: So I posted on the official forums and it turns out the server time wasn't synced, so it was actually considered morning. I was told to try re logging to fix it and if that didn't work they would hopefully fix it eventually. Re logging didn't work for me so next time I just have to make sure to check /servertime instead of going by the normal time in game.

I decided to grind in the game corner to get another Eevee. Not too excited for the grind of training/raising happiness again but what's done is done I suppose.

Most of you made accounts only to sit on the name, you don't even post outside of the sub unless it is directly related to pokemmo. Why are you doing this?

Apartment/Guild House system -- 
Similar to caves in B/W--
Instant access to PC/ Shared PC--
Password protected entry/ need to be a member--
Customizable/ Expandable/ ""Secret base"" Hideout for you and yours! 

Hey guys, I know there aren't many active people on this board but I wanted to throw this out here.  I believe that there are people already starting ""guilds/teams"" and think that it would be great to have a system very much like the caves in B/W.  There, one could have access to one's own apartment or guild house (provided they are a member or have a password).  Coupled with some kind of teleport function (like instantly accessing the caves) one can easily get in touch with guild members to trade, or have access to a PC (ever try to catch something with a full box?  No buenos.) in case you need to switch out an HM mule.  Another Idea is a shared guild PC, like a Guild bank to store pokemon, items, even money.  So what do you think? Feasible?

Let me start here, I played Red and Blue when I was a KID, have not really touched them since I lost my gameboy in like 1998. My friend told me about this game and of course I went out and bought a copy of fire red so I could play. Now I know some things have seriously changed (still have no idea how to best use IV's) and there are a LOT of things I don't remember. That being said it seems that every time someone asks a stupid question they get berrated to the point where the game does not get fun. 

I understand that I can google anything about the game, I also understand that we have modified a single player game to make it into a dynamic multiplayer experience. What is the harm with people asking stupid questions. I said that the devs should put a newbie channel in the game for people who are just starting and want to help eachother out. I just feel that this community will never be successful if we don't help eachother out. If they bring Gen 4 into PokeMMO I will go buy it but I literally have never played it. I think I played a friends Pokemon Black for about 2 hours one time, but I will have a TON of stupid questions.

Basically I've ended up with a setup that will either rape or suck depending on what I come up against, so I could use some help either getting some pointers on how to properly set up a team or maybe some suggestions to which pokemons to swap out and what to get instead, perhaps an entirely new lineup. But please keep in mind that I'm somewhat new to the game again, so I wont be able to go just anywhere to pick up a pokemon, but at least I'll know what to look out for :)

Anyway, here's my setup:

* Kadabra
* Butterfree - it seems to overlap a bit with Kadabra having good cc and psychic damage; So I'm thinking I should get rid of one of those two at least?
* Warturtle
* Pikachu - Loving the paralyze (whatever it's called)
* Pidgeotto  - He doesn't really see much use, it's mostly used as an ""oh fuck"" when the 4  abovementioned do poorly
* Beedrill - Same as Pidgeotto pretty much

I know it's probably pretty bad, but I've only just gotten my 3rd badge so I'm still prettty new.  

Also, please note that I'm not looking for a lineup to ""roflstomp"" people in duels, just some cookie cutter, simple setup to use while going through the game to help me get a better understanding the game overall, while going through the ""story"".

Hope some of you fine folks are willing to help me :)

1354425453.0	1450kw	Why is this not open source?	DatThingDer	11	5	10	"Edit : (Dammit... that shitty formatting.)

Yet another one...  




So why is this not open source? Why are pretty much none of the Pokemon MMO open source?  
All Pokemon MMO have suffered greatly from at least one of the following, stemming from the fact that they are closed source :   
- Unpleasant staff  
- Unpleasant community  
- Slow development  
  
  
Examples :  
- Pokemon Cyrus Online - When I played it back in 2009, it had very, very immature staff (all 17 years olds and below, their youngest one, 15, being the most mature of them). It was its greatest problem. The lead developer (Cyrus) was simply really self-important and arrogant. The server was very badly managed and they rolled out changes that included glitches that would allow people to gain advantage and would destroy the ""economy"". That's not to say that the server was starting to get overrun by toxic Brazilians at the time. There was some kind of petty bashing and competition against other Pokemon MMOs going on as to who would get the best Pokemon MMO.  
- Pokemon World Online - I heard (heard. I haven't actually played, so for what it's worth :) that it has been overrun by scammers, ruining the economy and the community.  
- Pokemon Online (POL) - It has been in development forever and it doesn't seem like it's going to see the light of the day anytime soon. They want to get it right the first time, but others might be beating them to it.  
- PokeMMO - Development is also slow.  
- Pokémon : Den of Ages - Had very friendly staff and great custom maps back when I played it in 2009, but has only one developer. So the development is slow. The client runs on Windows only and the game is not very popular, in spite of being very good.  
  
  
What I don't understand is that nobody is able to come together and create a basic Pokemon MMO, which everyone would be free to configure, customize, fork, mod and run however they want afterwards. I know that it is very feasible, so I really don't understand why it's not happening. We're not talking about developing a new game concept and new game mechanics, everything is already there. We already know how pretty much everything should work vanilla.  
  
  
I have some programming knowledge in java, in GUI and socket servers, so I could definitely help with some minor things as simple as say, making a tabbed chat system or at least making it so the channel can be selected from a drop down menu instead of successively clicking a button. But I can't, because for them to let me access the source, I'd probably have to prove them that my skills are worthwhile first (which they are not, they are obviously more experienced than I). It would be much more simple if anyone could submit anything for a commit, without engagement. Job would get done much more quickly and 10 different groups of people wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel 20 times.  
  
  
Consider Minecraft and the Bukkit API, or Spout and Tekkit which also require a modified client. Everyone is happy and whoever isn't happy can start their own server. There are very large public servers as well as very small private servers. All have different gameplays. This model is a winner.  
  
  
To quote a friend, what keeps most games alive past their release is the ability of players to either mod it, create in game content or improve upon it.  
  
  
To apply this to a Pokemon MMO would mean that players could make custom maps, add content and alter the game mechanic however they wish.

It uses the default bindings but can be changed. I only spent an hour on it so it may behave a bit funny but I think it's in a usable state. 

How to use:

-[Install autoit](http://www.autoitscript.com/cgi-bin/getfile.pl?autoit3/autoit-v3-setup.exe)

-[Download the archive-need to extract](http://www.filedropper.com/pokemmogamepad_2)

-Run pokemmo script or compile it to have an easier to use .exe

EDIT-forgot to mention that this actually works better than just using a keyboard. For example when you are starting battle and u hold ""a"" it will chose attack and first attack without stopping, with this script if u hold the corresponding gamepad key then it will wait until it's released and pressed again so it doesn't skip through choosing which attack you want to do, it doesn't autoclick like keyboard input does when holding down a key

Edit2-For some reason, not sure if it's autoit or the gamepadex library i'm using, while the script runs it spams the capslock and ctrl key, this doesn't interfere with the game but does with windows so exit the script to end this behavior. "	t5_2tt0u	True

Like a ton of Snorlaxes (Snorlaxi?). 
On my dick. 
So of course I did the logical thing and downloaded PokeMMO....and it was glorious. 
It wasn't too long until I heard of 'lucky eggs' and how much of a buttpain it was to acquire your very own through a Chansey in the Safari Zone....
My first reaction was a brisk, barking laugh in the face of the RNG gods. Previously mentioned, I played Borderlands 2 where one literally (but actually figuratively) sat on their knees and sucked the RNG gods' dicks until they give you a legendary weapon...
Coming from BL2 I thought ""Pfft, catching a Chansey? No big deal bring those little pink bitches to me"" .......
Now I started off confidently with the idea that I'd have meself a lucky egg within the hour.
Several hours later and many Safari sessions later I realized how wrong I was.
Hours after that I cried myself to sleep for only being able to catch 3 Chanseys.
For the next week I periodically searched for Chanseys and lucky eggs, but to no avail. 
So today, my birthday, I'm turning a new leaf and not wasting my time on those damn Chanseys.

I needed for sure the 211 stat for level 50 and was thinking about dumping the other 252 EV in HP stat or maybe DEF. Because its funny watching people try to attack after a light screen set up and using him for a bit of a wall / paralyser is not what people expect.

1351278846.0	124zn2	PokeMMO Pokemon/Lucky Egg Giveaway	Krobelux	6	2	11	"Hey guys! So I'm relatively new to PokeMMO and the Reddit community as well as streaming on Twitch.

In just over a week I've farmed a few Lucky Eggs, and have caught a few decent Natured/IV Pokemon as well as grown a small audience over on Twitch. Now I would like to celebrate my small achievement by doing a giveaway!

I'm not sure how well this will work, but I plan on doing a giveaway for 6 Pokemon and 1 Lucky Egg at 2:00 PM PST today. I'll be streaming at 1:00 PM PST (45 minutes from now, of posting this). I would like to have at least 30 viewers that way not one or two people win everything.


Here are the rules:
-Be in my stream at the time of the Giveaway
-You DO NOT have to be a follower
-Don't flame or be derogative to myself or other viewers
-If your username is called, please be attentive. After 30 seconds I will reroll.

Pretty basic. Like I said though you do NOT have to be a follower. I don't feel like I need to warrant that you need to be because I'm really just doing this for fun and as a way to give back to the community. I'd like to do more giveaways in the future assuming all goes well. 

I believe I've covered everything. I hope everything works out as I've never done a giveaway before, so this should be fun! Hope to see many of you there! (•‿•)


Here's a link to my stream:

Here is what I'm giving away:

TL;DR
I'll be giving away 6 decent Nature/IV Pokemon as well as 1 Lucky Egg.

First of all, I just started PokeMMO - I did play Pokemon with the old Blue/Red Version on my normal Gameboy when I was a kid, and this game kinda brings this old gamer feeling back, so thanks for that.

Unfortunately there is one little issue; it seems like the whole of China is blocked from the game. I am living in Beijing right now, and if I try to access the homepage, I have to go through a 'captcha'. Captcha sucks and I suck at Captcha, so when I fail to put in the right answer, I can not connect to the Homepage until I reset my router.

Worse though is, that always when I try to connect the game client, I get the 'cannot receive update feed' (or something like that) message - its impossible to connect.

I have no problem though to connect with a VPN - unfortunately that makes the game quite laggy.

1366917942.0	1d3p1v	Thoughts on amateur mid-story competitive battling	tee_ess_ay	1	1	0	"I'm currently on a Nuzlocke run of the storyline with an amateur competitive-battle side. (The Gen I storyline is actually quite enjoyable, IMO). Here are some thoughts:

.
.

It seems that competitive battling (a la Smogon) is pretty much separate from playing through the story. This makes the first ~50 hours of gameplay largely a grindfest to acquire lvl. 100, good EVs/IVs, and TMs for your desired moveset.

Nuzlocking is great fun for veterans who have already played through once.

There is no reward for PvP battles while you are progressing through the story -- I'm the only person I know who battles strangers.

Finding good matchups is a pain -- I can't tell when people are way higher level than I am.

.
.

Thoughts of a 'competitive' scene mid-story: (take with a grain of salt, i'm no expert):

.
.


Nuzlocke makes it very difficult to catch and keep desired pokemon for your team -- Abra is rare, hard to catch and squishy.

Movesets are very limited early game -- TMs available at Celadon include Attract, a poor man's Thunder wave; Secret Power, a weak Return; Brick Break, good power and wide availability

Entire sides of the metagame are unavailable, e.g. Stealth Rock/Spikes, Wish/Baton Pass, weather, Endeavor/Flail + Focus sash variants, Hidden Power, Toxic.

Dig and Fly, while quite useful in the story, are predictable and so poor choices in PvP.

Paraflinching and variations are easy since Bite is common; notably Zubat with confuse ray/attract, bulky Squirtle with attract, Butterfree

Sleep Powder Butterfree is possibly OP pre-30; it has excellent stats at low levels and has access to Compoundeyes boosted Sleep powder/Stun spore/Supersonic. Can hit hard with confusion/psychic or STAB aerial ace. It can OHKO Vital spirit Mankey but can be checked by an early Golem.

Similarly early Beedrill is a fearsome sweeper with STAB twineedle, Brick Break to counter geodude/onix.

Trade-evolutions have better stats than most at the same level; Alakazam is most common but Gengar/Machamp/Golem can still pose a threat.

Playing Nuzlocke forces a tankier build, as you can be careless with glass cannons in story (e.g. crit Hyper Fang from a Rocket grunt, Magnitude 10 on wild Geodude, Selfdestruct Koffing/Voltorb).

PokeFlute and Yellow flute both offer 1-turn sleep/confusion cures mid-game. May not be useful without a speed advantage.

Other good choices are Gyarados from the Magikarp salesman and early Alakazam from trading. Dragon Rage/Secret Power are excellent early, and Water Pulse offers early STAB.

Low PP moves are an annoyance in story, e.g. if Giga drain is your only offense on Ivysaur, you're gonna have a bad time farming.

It's often worth it to delay evolution for earlier moves.

Trading pre-Misty can be dangerous as pokemon may be unruly.

A severe lack of fire types and ground moves makes bulky Ivysaur (Leech seed/Poisonpowder/Sleep Powder) difficult to deal with; Gyarados/Beedrill can kill at the risk of Sleep Powder, Alakazam can OHKO.

Few sure-hit moves make double team/minimize worth bannin. A last resort is Swift Sandshrew which hard counters Pikachu but might have trouble with Clefable, or Odor Sleuth Growlithe if anticipated.

Snorlax, and Lapras and the Eevee-lutions are great additions mid-story and will probably be popular among Nuzlockers as they are all tanky. For Nuzlockers, Espeon can replace Alakazam and Jolteon for Pikachu. Vaporeon is typical bulky water (rare in early game, minus Squirtle); Umbreon is tanky and STAB Bite/Faint attack can hit Alakazam and Gengar.

Trading for Dratini/Beldum/Bagon/Larvitar is expensive and hence rare. No early ice, but their stats are mediocre until they evolve anyways.

Grinding at game corner for BoltBeam, etc. is annoying but effective.
Many of these issues can be solved with bans; but bans may be unfeasible for 'casual' amateur battlers who are just looking for a challenge while they beat story.

Any thoughts or additions are welcome. (Also posted on pokemmo forum)."	t5_2tt0u	True

Is it a legit pokemon mmo?

What games of the series are included in the story of the game?

Are all generations of pokemon in the game?

Is it still the same pokemon game in a sense but with co op?

That said, the sound effects for some reason, for me, are important to the experience. I just find myself not as into the game without that stuff, and the unsynced music is just really bothersome, but then when I have that all the way down there's no sound at all :(.

Just curious if there's an ETA or any sort of idea about when sound effects will be added. Sorry if this is a noob question, I searched on this sub-reddit ""sound effects"" and only found one or two posts saying that they aren't in, but nothing about when it may end up being in the game.

1350421405.0	11l9vq	(HELP) Original Blue version	Absit_Peccavi	3	4	1	I just bought the gf a used copy of Blue for GBC on Amazon and I started it up to test it out.  I got all the way through all of the opening sequence and choosing my starter, battled the rival, then saved. The last thing I wanted to check was that it would continue the saved game data, which it did not. I contacted the user I bought it from, but he won't accept a return. I know that the issue is the internal battery, so my question is: Does anyone know how I can replace the battery without damaging the actual game?  If not, is there any other way to fix it? I just wanted to give her a piece of nostalgia, then this ruined it for me. Any help is appreciated.	t5_2tt0u	True

I've seen a bunch of picture of overly crowded areas, and have a pretty easy solution to it. 

What if any storyline-important areas are instanced for each player, so there can only be one or a few players in that area? This should limit how crowded they can become and make the story play out closer to the original.
For the rest of the world, why don't you simply double the amount of space? Just duplicate the number of tiles in each area, and the crowding problem should be quatered! If you're confused on the math there, doubling the tiles meaning increasing the length and width by a factor of two, which increases the area by a factor of four.

Wouldn't this be an easy solution to the crowding problems?
