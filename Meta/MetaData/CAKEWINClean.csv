Hi all! I am also sorry if this is not the correct sub, I just figured this would be the right place to start!

 I have just recently moved, and for the time being, I am planning on selling cakes/cupcakes from my house, until a position opens up at a store. That way I don't get rusty.

My question is about transporting tiered cakes. I have a 4-door car, so I don't have a flat surface to be able to transport the cake fully assembled. The only thing I can come up with is just transporting the cake unassembled and then when I get to the location, assemble and add finishing touches.

If that is my only option, what kind of containers are best for transportation? 

Any answers or additional advice is greatly appreciated!

1349026283.0	10pu85	I know this is r/cakewin, but my 1st 3D cake was a cake failure and I'm wondering if any of you experienced bakers could give me advice?	Streetlights_People	21	2	11	"First: apologies if this is the wrong subreddit, but /r/baking seems more focused on recipes than on 3D cake construction. I've seen many gorgeous 3D cakes posted here and am wondering if this subreddit's  experienced cake artists could steer me in the right direction after a cake failure. 

I make cakes just as a hobby. I've made a few wedding cakes for friends, but this was my first sculpted cake. I was trying to make a Fozzie bear cake and planned to sculpt the body out of cake, then add a head, arms and legs I made out of rice cereal treats. I made the rice cereal treats without butter (like the recipe suggested) and crafted the head on to a plastic dowel. It looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/6EFAc.jpg) .

I next made the cake out of a dense red velvet cake that was pretty similar in texture to a pound cake. I made 3 batches (6 individual cakes in total) and stacked them with cardboard separators and dowels on every second layer. I used a cream cheese icing I'd stabilized with vanilla pudding mix. So far so good. 

The problem came when I tried to add the head. My use of cardboard separators meant that there was only 4 inches or so of cake to sink the dowel attached to the head into, which wasn't enough to support the head's weight. I tried to make rice krispie treat shoulders around the head to give it some support and attach them using icing. This worked okay, and I proceeded to decorate the cake with the same stabilized cream cheese icing. 

I attached a gumpaste hat, but when I tried to attach a bow of thinly rolled gumpaste, a disaster hit. The weight of the gumpaste pulled the head and shoulders forward and they began to fall off. The motion pulled the ears off, and the icing on the chest began to slide off. End result is, sadly, [this](http://i.imgur.com/Jic0r.jpg) . Hours and hours of work down the drain!

I therefore have a couple of questions:

* How do you apply gumpaste to piped icing?
* What's the best way to connect rice krispie elements to the cake? 
* What's the best way to connect rice krispie elements to each other? I tried to use a bunch of toothpicks to connect the ears to the head, but as you can see....it didn't work?
* I used dowels and cardboard separators to give the cake stability, but it prevented me from sinking the head as far into the cake as needed. Could I have gotten away without using doweling for a cake of that size?
