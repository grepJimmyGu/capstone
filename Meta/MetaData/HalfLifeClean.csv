1345687218.0	yo89l	The stages of Half-Life 3 deprivation	Twagstir	229	33	86	"Stage 1: You've just beaten half life 2 episode 2 and are in shock. You want to curl up in a ball and think about the journey. You then go to google and find out the release date of episode 3 or Half-Life 3. You find that there is no established date. You expect it to come soon.

Stage 2: You expect it to come at any major gaming event, be it E3 Gamescon or what have you. Every time they come and go you get more and more disappointed. I mean, look at all the clues that people are finding!

Stage 3: I bet they're going to release it randomly, on steam. They are just going to go ahead and throw it on steam, no commercials or advertising or anything. I bet tomorrow Im going to load up steam and buy Half Life 3 right away!

Stage 4: Google search Half-Life 3 every day. Filter by last 24 hours. Every day you see some bit of news saying that Half-Life 3 is around the corner. You savor every bit.

Stage 5: Theories. You see if you subtract Gabe's weight from pi you get 23562089650238695, and if you rearrange those numbers you can get a date! HL3 CONFIRMED!

Stage 6: Maybe if i forget it will be released.. just maybe... 

Stage 7: Acceptance. Patience is a virtue. Why not look on the bright side? The longer it takes, the better it is, right? RIGHT?!!? "	t5_2rgym	True

*You all need to calm down.*

Seriously. We've been doing this song and dance for going on *6 years. 6!* 

Don't get me wrong, *I get it*. I get why people are so desperate for information regarding the next installment. Hell, I have:

* A [Combine Overwatch tattoo](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#0)
* A [Lambda Core tattoo](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#1)
* A soon-to-be-fiance named Alyx (seriously), who has a matching [Lambda Core tattoo](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#2)
* A signed copy of [Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#3)
* I've sewn [Snark plushes](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#7)
* I've built a replica of [Alyx's Gun](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#9)
* I built a [model diorama of post-rebellion City 17](http://imgur.com/a/hInE1#11)
* I've visited [Valve's Office](https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/380982_2849342666201_133297027_n.jpg)
* I own every physical copy of every Half-Life game
* I've got the Gravity gun on preorder
* I've read many of Marc Laidlaw's books (my favorite is Dad's Nuke)
* And tons of other stuff

I am *just as invested in this franchise as many of you.* Hell, I might have even gone a little creepy in my fandom. If that's the case, I genuinely hope that when somebody like me begs for the community to relax, people will at least notice.

People, everybody just needs to take a deep breath, take a step back, and *think*.

Valve *is working on this game*. We're talking about one of, if not the most, revered games in the history of video games. The economics of such a release alone would render the decision to *not* make the game idiotic.

But we've ballooned the community's excitement for this game so much that anything less than super-human perfection will be enough to satisfy us. If there is a *single flaw* in this game, people are going to hate it. It doesn't matter if this game is better written than The Great Gatsby, or more moving than Schindler's List; if Half-Life 3 isn't perfect in every conceivable way, our community is going to hate it.

*Valve knows this*. And I think Valve is an even harsher critic of their work than we are. Valve has established itself as the type of company that will release a game *only* when it is perfect in their eyes, and that is part of what makes them amazing as a company.

The level of desperation I see from people trying to find clues is genuinely saddening. I see users ripping apart glitches until it's nothing but a few lines of obfuscated code. I see posters claiming that Valve's employees are intentionally lying about the existence of an ARG. I think there are actually people out there who believe that Valve is letting people believe in the next Half-Life to keep them invested in Steam.

Now, I get that there is a certain element of circlejerk in this desperate quest for information. I get that a lot of people do this as a joke. But Poe's Law dictates that there are *some* of you that can't relax, that can't stop the search. I beg of you: please remain calm.

Half-Life 3 *is coming*. Valve *is working on it*.  There was an entire floor (one of five) of Valve's office we *weren't even allowed to see*. 

Valve won't let us down, but we need to relax. *Everybody*.

Half-Life 3 is another day closer to release than it was yesterday. Never forget that."	t5_2rgym	True

I was extremely excited when I heard about this opportunity. My goal was clear for me: fight my way through Ravenholm using the Rift. Let me tell you: It's completely different. While this may sound cut-and-pasted, it made it so that I was *actually there*. As a result, I started understanding the space around me, and what exactly I was putting Gordon's body through. The zombies are the same height as you, which may seem obvious, but actually is incredible to understand. I was facing a hulking abomination, not looking at a screen a few feet away. As for the game affecting me IRL, I had to crane my head upwards to climb a ladder, as opposed to just shifting my mouse forward and seeing the top. When I crouched to examine a dead headcrab, the thing was in my face. Dodging lunges from fast zombies was thrilling, and every swing of the crowbar held **weight** in it.

It was incredible, guys.

https://twitter.com/SurgeonSim2013/status/350341471657926656

EDIT: This has just been discovered in the TF2 update in Surgeon Simulator:
http://imgur.com/4jHlNMB

All credit goes to u/armrha

You can see the little rings around Saturn. It's got to be the solar system, and there's an arrow pointing from Saturn to a question mark. 
The korean is apparently 시간은 , which /u/Cosworthrev and /u/KinneySL have translated as 'The Time' or 'Time' or 'Period'.

 We had this tweet a few days ago from Steam: 

https://twitter.com/Steam_Support/status/349678346688405505
 The Korean there says 'Prepare for unforseen consequences'.

 Then HL2 was stuck in all the characters speaking Korean today, which was patched and fixed. 

The claim is that these aren't ARG related but, this third, Valve-related thing linking it all up, it's starting to look extremely suspicious. There have been a lot of ideas as to what the text to fill in the blanks is, from SATURN TETHYS to a whole host of other stuff. What do you guys think? and the Surgeon Simulator 2013 guys have tweeted an acknowledgement of the puzzle.


EDIT: 

Hey guys, some new info from around the web. Confirmed by many.

I'm going to compile a thread with a list of things that we know to have happened, some may not have been posted here before, some surely have.

1. /u/aliven434's [Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/ndQfN) noting employees and their levels, and their recently played games.

2. There was a Half-Life 2 patch note that said you can 'No longer pick up *Grigori's Annabelle* in **Ravenholm**' - note the missing e - 'if you're in the **wrong place at the wrong time**.' Familiar quote? As well, the person who posted this is in 13 different Steam groups and his level was 13.

3. The magazine scans mentioning Half-Life 3's 'terrarium'.

4. A potential reference to a significant date with the various iterations of either 3.7 - gigabytes - or 7.3 or other.

5. The Steam Support tweet in Korean that translates to 'Prepare for unforseen consequences'.

6. Also, all of this happened on June 25 - the day the Korean War began in 1950. /u/valdezvaldez pointed out that the developer who posted the patch notes has exactly 25 hours played on Half-Life 2, last seen today.

Alex and Gordon Freeman are married. They are at Alex's dads funeral. Everyone is sad. But suddenly a zombie Alex's dad comes out of ground. He walks towards them and he doesn't attack. He has the  good head crab on his head...Lammar... and it brought him back to life. Dr Kleiners says Lammar hop into my hands but she dosen't want to come off. Then Dead Alexs dad calls other bad aliens....but they are actually good. He can talk head crab. So he gets a bunch of nice head crabs.They all then help them defeat the combine. Then 
slowly Gordon hears a rattle in the bush. He goes over to the bush and finds little black spirits that don't attack. Gordon then crawls forward to find this big circle bright yellow thing that shines and then blue around and then red around it. And then he found this button and when he pressed it zombies come out. Then when he put something into the yellow dot. He knew it could work to save Alex's dad. So he brings Alex's dad there and he put him right in the middle square and it made him alive again. And Lammar was still alive and hopped into the doctors hands.   The End."	t5_2rgym	True
1347713822.0	zx9p5	Black Mesa. Success or failure?	PeteMalony	128	32	240	"First, I'd like to apologize for tricking you guys into clicking this post. Of course, Black Mesa is a success. The only failure, honestly, is the fact that now the wait for HL3 is that much more painful. But, in all seriousness, let's talk about some decisions the team made. I'll start. Crowbar animation and hit box. Why change it so much from HL2? HECU soldier voice acting. Why did they decide to purposely make it horrible? Crouch jumping. Why must I do it for obstacle's that clearly should not require it? That's all I got. Please, let's be constructive as we criticize.

EDIT: Ok, I've read all the comments so far. Seems we're all just about on the same page with most of the content. 
1) Crouch jumping (necessary, not optional. Xen excluded)
2) HECU voice acting (has negative affect on immersion)
3) Crowbar (animation/hit box questionable)
4) Soundtrack (out of place in some areas, but amazing)
5) Public announcer (absent. an integral and very important part of HL1)
6) Weapon acquisition order (BM team tried to make it new and fresh, ended up upsetting fans)
7) Movement (feels stiff, no weapon sway, EXAMPLE: Look all the way up then all the way down in HL2)
8) Engine (needs more physics based puzzles or scripted sequences)"	t5_2rgym	True

Triage is meant to tell the story of what happened while Freeman was gone, from the perspective of a citizen of City 17.

As Kleiner said, the events of Nova Prospekt were taken as a signal to begin the uprising. You play as Matthew, a citizen left with nothing after losing your family and home to the Combine. Without anything to live for in this oppressed city, you join up with the resistance to fight for the only thing you have left; your life. Fighting alongside other undistinguished citizens will give you a new, grittier perspective on the battle of City 17.
  
This mod will include new features such as:  
- A whole new singleplayer story with new locations, characters, and voices  
- New weapons, and weapon mechanics (ironsights)  
- Smarter NPC AI, ex: using cover, suppressive fire  
- Updated graphics and sound effects

If you're a fan of the HL2 universe and want to experience it again, please keep an eye on this mod.

1331953551.0	r0crk	I might know what's on the Borealis? Hear me out!	Blue_ODaniel	99	14	39	"Okay, so after racking my brain on and off over the years, I do believe I came to the conclusion of what might be on the Borealis. Before I get into the Borealis, I want to explain something first:

There are a lot of similarities to the Philadelphia Experiment. (Now to those who don't know what that is, it's an experiment supposedly conducted in the 1940's to render a warship invisible, and there are theories that it might have teleported and perhaps went forward in time a bit) But it's not the Experiment that's important so much as what's the theory behind it. It's called the Unified Field Theory. Coined by Albert Einstein, it's a mathematical formula that proposes that gravity and electromagnetism are one and the same, and that it can be used to bend light around an object. (The Philadelphia Experiment.) 

Now, the thing about the theory is,once Einstein solved the problem, he immediately destroyed it, claiming that humanity was not ready for what it holds. Einstein died, and now the only person who was able to solve it was dead, and no one was able to solve it afterwords.  That's where I believe that Aperture and Black Mesa come into play.

We all know that both Aperture and Black Mesa competed for federal funding for their development for their portal devices. Black Mesa was strong in the scientist numbers, but as we all know with the development of Aperture in Portal 2, their numbers in staff were... lacking. That's where the scientist spies from Black Mesa come into play. Two scientists in Klieners pictures are cut out, but they are seen in a picture with the Borealis, meaning they went to work for Aperture, betraying Black Mesa. with their knowledge of the super Portal that Black Mesa was developing, Aperture needed to find a retaliation to fight against Black Mesa in the race for the super Portal.

Now here's what I think might be on the Borealis.

First off, the name. Borealis. Named after the Aurora Borealis. The Northern Lights.It's an Ice-Breaker Ship meant to have the ability to break through the ice shelf in the arctic, but what better reason to go into the arctic than for the Northern Lights?

They're using the high amounts of energy from the Northern Lights to act as a super conductor, a power source to open a super portal! The very same from Black Mesa, and on top of The Citadel.

This also explains why Eli wants to destroy it, Kliener wants it to study, and why the combine are after it. 

(I also have a sub theory that GLaDOS was developed to complete the Unified Field Theory, but that's for [/r/Portal](/r/Portal) , with that being true, and the fact that GLaDOS' name is on the ownership certificate for the borealis, it might porve itself in further study, I'll get back to you on that.)


TL;DR, The Borealis might hold a super Portal device using the Aurora Borealis (The Northern Lights) As a power source/conductor.



EDIT: In Portal 2, when you go to the Borealis dry dock, there's a message from Cave Johnson about a teleportation experiment. (the one where your skin might not teleport with you). Both the Borealis and the Philadelphia Experiment teleported from dry dock. If this is true, that means that the Borealis disappearing might not have been an accident, Cave Johnson might have oversaw its departure, but it could have killed the crew.   Just thought I should throw out there."	t5_2rgym	True

1366752733.0	1cypqn	A New Appreciation for HL2	ZeroCracked	93	11	50	"While we all know Half-Life 2 is an incredible game, I decided to open up, about a couple weeks ago, my copy of the game on my Steam account to do a bit of achievement hunting, since I was bored with BioShock and I was still waiting for The Knife of Dunwall to come out. I boot up the game and decide to switch the difficulty onto hard, since I always played the game on easy or normal. Before, I would just jump headfirst into a firefight and take at least a couple hundred rounds before walking out victorious. But I tried that my first couple fights, and I can't count the number of times I died. What happened throughout the game was a sort of rediscovery of HL2 for me.

In the past, I would treat it as any other linear game. Go from point A to point B, shoot things, listen to what people have to say, and move on. I gave no appreciation for the AI for either the allies or enemies, and I didn't even bother to stop for the odd cache or two. But then, I found myself stopping everywhere I knew there was a cache, and paying more attention to how enemies reacted to my movements.

As I stated before, in the past, I'd grab my MP7 and shottie and raze everything in my path. But something hit me a few minutes ago. I'm currently up to the bridge section of Highway 17. I parked my car on the hill leading up to the bridge, and actually got to work. I realized what I was doing as soon as I popped the door open and threw a grenade in to weed them out.

The Combine AI is a lot more advanced than I gave them credit for. When I play on a lower difficulty, I'd just view them as human-shaped targets standing in the path of my bullets. But I crank up the difficulty, and suddenly, they're the highly trained soldiers they're meant to be. I recall a post some months ago asking for advice for a mod to HL2, to increase Combine AI among other things, so they would flank you, throw grenades in your hiding spots, and other possible ways to squeeze every last bit of health out of you. But I notice they do exactly that.

I crawled down the hill staying low, and ever so slowly approached the house. I whipped out a grenade, and opened the door. They were ready to take me out before I threw it right in and backed off. They survived the explosion and were ready to give chase, but I was waiting with my Gravity Gun and a gas canister. With that house clear, I got all the ammo and health inside and went back out. From there, I crawled to the right wall of the shed and tossed a grenade towards the right house as a distraction. That got their attention. I whipped out my AR2 and fired away, then I got hit by a shotgun blast from my side. I hadn't even noticed they were getting around me. There, I switched to my shotgun and revolver, and the ones that got too close, I filled with about three shells of buckshot, and put a round into the head of anyone I could hit from further away.

Then it hit me. I was actually planning out my movements, and thinking about how I approached the situation. That is the very essence of Half-Life. Run, think, shoot, live.
Run down the hill.
Think about the enemy positioning and how to approach them.
Shoot back.
Live through their flanking techniques and counterattacks.

A little further back, in the area just after you get the crossbow, a bunch of them hole up in the house. I decided to hide out in the garage and wait for them to come after me. Then I saw them throw something. (I have all my weapons reskinned/reanimated and the grenade mod takes away the beeps.) I thought nothing of it, then an explosion went off in my face. They were weeding me out of my hiding space. I took off to hide behind a chest high wall. (I blame the Call of Duty SP campaigns that I played beforehand.) They flanked me on either side of the wall. I barely made it through THAT situation.

I really have a new appreciation for the game now. Looking for lambda caches (Especially now that I decided to turn up the game's graphics to max), going Gravity Gun only in Ravenholm, and going out of my way for achievements, has really given me a new outlook on enemy behavior and the character AI, as well as HL2's general atmosphere.

www.blackmesasource.com/

I'm going to share my final verdict for the G-Man Mystery. 

NOTE: I've pondered this theory for many many years and there may be some holes. Please leave feedback 

So, the G-Man has been a mystery since the first HL game. And everybody wants to know his motives. Well here it is.

G-Man delivers the crystal to Black Mesa, and he knew what it would do to Earth, hence his famous quote, ""Prepare for unforeseen consequences."" The Xenannian creatures may have been pulled to Earth against their will, or maybe not, seeing as though they had an army ready. But how could they have known? Did G-Man and the Nihlanth plot this? Why would they be ready? It HAD to be pre-meditated.

Why would Xen help G-Man's obscure group? G-Man said THEY had control over Xen after the events of Half-Life 1. Did G-Man and his group DUPE Xen in order to gain the borderworld for the events of Half-Life 2? Or maybe he had other reasons for this. Like Xen being taken over, Earth being shattered, and the Nihilanth being killed by Gordon Freeeman. This means that G-Man used Gordon to finish him off. His final act for Xen.

After that, he locks Gordon in stasis against his will to await his NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

While Freeman was in stasis for 20 years, the Combine force their way through the riff created at Black Mesa and take over Earth in roughly 7 hours. And from what Breen says about his portal technology, it seems the Combine have Xen too... Did G-Man give them away? And for what price?
The 7 hours war was not between Xen and Earth, but between Earth and the Combine armada. Xen was just a side effect to open the riff. After Black Mesa was nuked, Xen was just being picked off. Besides the (now broken free from Nihilanth's control) Vortigaunts and the headcrabs (which are being used by the Combine).

G-man is using Gordon as his ""champion"" in overthrowing investors in his group. 

Look at it like this: A man (G-Man) has put something for auction online. Like a house (Earth). He is the landlord. He gets a real estate agent (Gordon) to sell the house to other people, even though there are still people living inside it. The new tenants practically take control of the previous owners. Then, the man gets his real estate agent to remove the new tenants. Thus making a profit. He continues to do this until he is rich. That is practically what G-Man is doing to Earth.

But maybe Gordon is special. Why else would have such boundless energy? G-Man no doubt sees the danger in this and is ready at any time to overthrow GORDON if he ever tries to rebel against G-Man. Maybe that's what Eli was trying to warn him about before he was assassinated? Perhaps that's why G-Man locked Shephard in stasis as well. Seeing his potential in case Gordon was killed, or if G-Man had to kill Gordon himself. (G-Man is obviously skilled in combat, as shown by the opening of HL2: EP1)

Breen is totally aware that G-Man sold the Combine Earth, as told be his legendary statement,""Did you realize your contract was open to the highest bidder?"" The highest bidder for Earth (the house) being the combine. But it may or may not be apparent to him that G-Man is overthrowing investor, after investor. If that was true, Breen would have had Gordon killed a LONG time ago. Also, Breen's statement about Gordon being controlled backs up the fact that G-Man is forcing Gordon to be his champion. In retrospect, that is the equivalent of controlling him. But that's the only shaky part of this theory because HL3 has yet to have seen the light of day. 

Naturally, if G-Man told the Combine where Eli was, they would be happy to finish him off. Perhaps G-Man meant to kill Gordon in that situation due to him being disobedient at the end of HL2 and escaping stasis via the vortigaunts. G-Man NEVER WANTED THAT...
He either wants to have Gordon kill the combine so he can have the land all to himself, OR he wanted Gordon dead ever since he broke free from stasis. And closing the Combine portal, thus closing MOST of the riff caused by Black Mesa, put a huge hole in his plans, and now wants Gordon dead, and Shephard to take his place. 

This alone can only be answered in Half-Life 3.

The Nihilanth wasn't a villian, he was humanitiy's last hope. They needed his help to save Earth. Because if G-Man needed Gordon to kill the Nihilanth, he obviously couldn't do it himself. If G-Man hadn't taken out Nihilanth, Xen doesn't get conquered. Xen isn't conquered, no Combine. 

No Combine, No 7 Hours war..

No seven hours war, Earth would have been saved. But that didn't happen. You were DECEIVED by the G-Man and are working for the REAL villain. The G-Man.

Famous last statements by the Nilihanth before he died:

""The last, I. AM. THE. LAST."" (of my kind) OR (hope for your pitiful species)
""Win. You cannot win."" (Against him)
""Comes. Another"" (Tyrant)
""Deceive you. He will DECEIVE you."" (G-Man will kill Gordon when he doesn't need him anymore)
""You. Are. Man. He. Not. Man. For you he waits... For you..."" (self explanatory)
""Win. You cannot win..."" (any longer)

Well... That's it... I've finally gotten my word out. I'm not saying this is set in stone or anything, it's just an elaborate theory that I've pieced together. Please leave feedback if I missed anything"	t5_2rgym	True

It might mean nothing, but since when does Valve repeat a small detail like this so many times for it to mean nothing? What if they are spies for the 'benefactors' (or advisors, take your pick)

MDirty	97	24	68	"**AT THE MOMENT, THERE IS NO SOLID PROOF OF A HALF LIFE 3 ARG. KEEP ON YOUR TOES, DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP TOO MUCH, BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON.**

**Current state: There is still little evidence supporting a Half Life 3 ARG, just hype trains. There is, however, an unrelated puzzle/ARG in Surgeon Simulator 2013. Completely unrelated to Valve. No, Ricochet's achievements are not new (see below). As for SS 2013, at the moment, we're out of clues on it. Valve has denied all ARGs. They're probably telling the truth...for now.** 

So, as you've heard from that other post, there may or may not be enough evidence to prove an ARG for Valve from Surgeon Simulator 2013. There is quite a lot of evidence that implies this, not necessarily directly say it, but it's enough. An explanation for Gabe Newell and Mark Laidlaw having no idea about the ARG is the fact that they may not be working on it (the ARG) at all. Note Valve's project system. Mark might just be writing for the story. He doesn't have any use in the ARG. This MIGHT explain the emails and whatnot that dismisses an ARG, but don't get your hopes up still. About Gabe's email. He may be faking us, or he may have no idea it's going on at all. Who knows? We have to give it the benefit of doubt.

In this thread, we should discuss ARG related stuff, assuming there is one. Joking should be kept to a minimum. Here is some evidence and conjectures I've compiled. Remember to take everything with a grain of salt. Some of these may be coincidental. Don't assume too much unless we have definitive proof.

**SURGEON SIMULATOR 2013 HAS A PUZZLE, BUT IT HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH VALVE!**

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** I just got up and found out the Surgeon Simulator 2013 developers were screwing with us. The puzzle in Surgeon Simulator 2013 has nothing to do with a Half Life ARG. Although they very clearly mocked us about it, as there was Korean on one of their dev's twitter saying, ""Prepare for unforeseen consequences,"" the exact same thing said by Steam Support.

Refer to this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyS3-DvO7NT8eKLfCMPyAcXCpP1tSTLUX26bKjERqsk/edit?pli=1

-Note that all links between Surgeon Simulator 2013 and Half Life at this time have been disproved. See the twitter links and update above. Do note, however, that while the SS2013 puzzle may be under the *medic* statue, it's most likely just the object they used for their puzzle. Remember, it's THEIR puzzle in THEIR game, so it's not Valve related at all. But the usage of Korean in their puzzle is obvious mockery. ^^^^^^get ^^^^^^the ^^^^^^pitch ^^^^^^forks

-It turns out the connection was Korea was just that many Valve games were released in Korea recently, and that's why they did it on Korean important dates, if you get what I'm saying. The connection to Korea is NOT Half Life related, as it's happening to plenty other games. Half Life 2 just coincidentally got a Korean language bug. There's also a Dota 2 tournament in Korea, the first of its kind, involving Nexon, a close partner of Valve. Do note anything Korean related is most likely not related to the ARG (if there is one) now.

-There was an unrecorded (in the update log) item (a claim check ticket) added to TF2, it has numbers on it that resemble cpordinates of some sort. Maybe not.

-Some players have reported their steam clients freezing up and playing the Tetris theme. Whether or not this is related to the puzzle/ARG is unknown. It seems to only happen in group chats.

-Ricochet is not a part of this. The achievements it has are called FinishedGame, FoundEasterEgg, and Invincible, according to Steam API. They were here since about [February](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1238036&amp;p=39760199&amp;viewfull=1#post39760199) and are most likely not involved in the ARG.

We need to focus on things in TF2 and Half Life, we can pretty much disregard Surgeon Simulator 2013 for now.

I had just gone through my second divorce and Wendy was going through her first. Neither of us were looking to get back into a new relationship anytime soon.  Around the same time the Chappelle show was playing a bit about True Hollywood Stories with Charlie Murphy, brother of Eddie.  For those of you who may not be familiar with the bit, [here it is](http://youtu.be/tqD6q_8DpLU).

While playing Half-Life online one night someone decided to change their name to Rick James.  I changed mine to Charlie Murphy to go along with the gag.  At about this time Wendy had just had an argument with her ex to be and was looking to blow off some some steam by going online to play.  While looking at names of players in servers she saw her husbands name, Charlie Murphy.  She thought ""that idiot is playing with his own name"" and decided she was going to go in and put a whoopin' on him.  Little did she know it would go the other way.  After a few times of being killed by me she realized I was not who she thought I was. We got to talking and over days and months built a great friendship and I ended up moving to New York to be with her just over a year later.

1362696062.0	19vh5l	Reasoned Prediction - Half-Life 3 exclusive launch title for Steam Box (also on Steam)	PantuTheDog	77	19	34	"Ok, hear me out here, because I think given what we know at the moment I think, tentatively, it's very reasonable to assume that Valve will release Half-Life 3 alongside the release of it's new Steam Box later this year.

Given that Gabe Newell is a very smart guy with excellent business sense, and given that entering the console market is a highly risky affair for *any* company whether they're as loved and as successful as Valve or not, it makes sense that Valve are going to want to give us some very convincing reasons to pick up one of their Steam Boxes when they launch later this year, especially considering Valve as a company can't really afford to sell the box at a significant loss and plan to make up their profits 5 or 10 years down the line in the way Microsoft planned to when they launched the first XBOX.

I think Valve are also aware of the fact that the people who will be most interested in buying a Steam Box will be console gamers who like the idea of Steam and the games it sells but are unwilling to shell out significant $$$ for a high-end gaming PC to adequately run its games on.

So what is the one sure-fire way Valve could convince this demographic to pick up a Steam Box at launch before it has established itself in the console market (which it won't be able to do in the first place without enough early adopters?)... EXCLUSIVE TITLES.

Now, what exclusives could Valve offer it's customers? It's usual repertoire of exclusives tend to be games which play best with a mouse and keyboard, but these types of games are also the exact type of games which will play WORST using a controller on a console hooked up to a TV. They may also have a nice library of exclusive indie games, but indie games are hardly system sellers. They need exclusives which work well within the living room, and given the insane popularity and dominance of First Person Shooters in the living room it seems that the most secure way for them to encroach upon the competition would be to offer at least a couple of must-have FPS titles from day one.

They will also want to avoid having to pay third party developers to make their games exclusive to it's new system, as Valve doesn't seem like the kind of company that could survive financially on such a business model in the same way that, say, Microsoft does. So what conclusion does this inevitably lead to? Valve needs at least one killer first-party FPS exclusive to launch alongside the Steam Box.

Given Gabe Newell's insistence on shrouding the development (or non-development!) of HL3 in complete secrecy - his recent comment to the BBC that 'when we have something to announce, we'll announce it' springs immediately to mind - we have no idea how far through development HL3 is. However, the ending to Half-Life 2 Ep 2 absolutely **screams** for there to be a sequel, and it seems inconceivable to me that given the popularity of the franchise and the long amount of time the company has had to develop the game it isn't somewhat far along in development, if not nearly finished in it's entirety.

If there's one thing which could guarantee the Steam Box is a hit, it's Half-Life 3. I don't think Newell and the rest of the team would be making such a huge gamble in entering the highly competitive console market without the assurance that their system will sell, and what better assurance than HL3 as an exclusive?

Anyway, that's my theory on the matter. Obviously it's important to remain **cautiously** optimistic about this possibility, but given that every successful console to date has required at least one killer app on or around it's launch date to propel it to an early success, given that Valve can't really afford for the Steam Box not to be an early success, and given that Gabe Newell is a highly intelligent businessman and knows that their home console has to be be an early success, I'm calling it...

**HALF LIFE 3, 2013 on Steam Box and Steam for PC.**

What do you think? I'd love to hear everybody else's views on the plausibility of my little theory wot I gone just typed out.



TL:DR - Valve needs a killer app to launch the Steam Box alongside, and the only sure fire game which could step up to the plate and ensure sales is Half-Life 3.


**EDIT** Forgot to mention, further evidence for a new killer FPS coming from them soon is the fact that Gabe  let slip to 4Chan members who came to visit Valve HQ last Autumn that Valve was working on Source Engine 2. I believe references to the new engine were found in the code for DOTA 2 as well. If they've had a new engine in the works for a while, what game do you really think they're going to show it off with?.."	t5_2rgym	True

1337662574.0	tysp1	Thoughts on HL3	footlong24seven	64	13	73	"Obviously Valve is working in HL3 and not Episode 3. It doesn't take 5+ years for episodic content to come out, considering that Valve said the intent with the episodic content was to release new games every 6-8 months. This is clearly not the case for the next game in the series.

Many gamers complain about the wait for the game. After all, EP2 was over 5 years ago, and we haven't heard a single word on HL3 except for some concept art, a few unconfirmed screenshots, and false rumors. Adding fuel to the fire, Valve recently announced that they won't be showcasing any new products at E3 2012. 

So why the wait? Rumors are abound with some kind of Steam console in the works (isn't that what a computer is?) or that Valve is waiting for the next generation of consoles. I honestly doubt both of these claims. Modern PCs with the latest graphics drivers can handle the game if it's going to be that demanding on a system. 

The more realistic reason, I think, is because Valve is aware of the public pressure on the release. This is possibly the most anticipated game in decades, and Valve sure as hell knows it. Considering the industry standard bar they raised with HL2 and Portal, HL3 is going to have to raise the bar again. From Valve's perspective, HL3 must be a masterpiece for the ages, or else people will make a big stink and lose faith in the company's creativity.

Graphics aren't really the issue. TF2 has minimal graphics and millions of people play it. What's really the issue for Valve is how do you make a game better than HL2 and Portal? Quite a tall order. Essentially, Valve is going to have to create a revolutionary game mechanic in order to lure players. Remember, HL2 introduced the Gravity Gun, and Portal introduced the Portal Gun. What new guns/mechanics can you conceive of that would be on par with these? A portal/gravity gun would be cheesy and make beating the game a walk through the park. 

Valve needs to figure out a new mechanic different from the portal gun and gravity gun (though the gravity gun may still be used in HL3). Otherwise, gamers will complain that they've been cheated.

TL;DR : Valve knows the hype around HL3. They want to deliver with the best game that was ever created - anything less would fall short of expectations. Hardware must be taken into account, but Valve's main issue is introducing an element into the game that is as revolutionary as the portal gun and gravity gun. 

Conclusion: If that's the case, then I don't mind waiting. I'm confident that Valve knows what it's going up against (essentially the community's expectations) and is taking their sweet time refining a game for the ages that will not only please the fans that have been waiting for so long, but will revolutionize FPS gaming as HL2 and Portal did. Be patient. It WILL be worth the wait. "	t5_2rgym	True

I have played over 30 hours of the original game, played some hours of the sequel (didn't make any big progress though), bought Half-Life: Blue Shift the other day (it was 75% off in Steam) and tried it a little bit. I also have HL2: Ep 2 (not one, that was a big mistake because now I'm waiting to have money so I can buy Ep 1). 

The thing is, it's one of my favourite series of games.

Having played so much the original game, I got to the Xen levels (after killing Gonarch, though I didn't get to Nihilant). Reading in forums and this subreddit, I see there's a general hate against Xen, something I don't understand since I felt that the levels were good and satisfactory. Could someone explain me why the final levels are so hated?

As far back as I can remember, I've always been a gamer. Whether it was finally beating Tetris after many hours of frustration, or finding out the princess is in another castle, I was there to experience it.

I can think of a time I was playing Super Mario Bros. 3 while my little brother Cody was watching. I handed him the second controller and showed him how to ""play"". Obviously I was still playing the game, but he didn't care, he was sharing the experience with his big brother.

I don't recall when I got a Super Nintendo. Those years went by fast, quite a few things were happening in my life at the time. I lost my step father Tim, and school wasn't going well. One day it happened. I got a Super Scope, holy cow I lost my marbles. That was the coolest thing I had ever seen in my entire life. I was shooting stuff on the screen with a FRICKIN BAZOOKA. Mother of GOD this was awesome.

We zoom ahead into the days where I got my Game Gear. I had it all, I got the carrying case, the attachable zoom screen, the extra battery pack, and all the sonic I could handle. I think that machine ate more AA batteries than anything else I've ever used. I think that was the time I also watched more Power Rangers than was healthy.

Fast forward a few years to Christmas one year at my grandparents house in New Mexico. I opened up my larger present to find a box with the words ""Nintendo 64"" staring me in the face. I couldn't believe it, I was the luckiest kid alive. I could have died right then and would have been fine with it. Many, many hours of Mario Kart 64 ensued along with other classics such as Golden Eye 007, Banjo Kazooie, Extreme G, Super Mario 64, and Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. At this point Cody got better at Golden Eye than I did.

A few years later Sony laid a fantastic video game system on me, the Playstation. So...Many...games... Crash Bandicoot, Jet Moto, Twisted Metal, Final Fantasy VII, Tomb Raider, Blasto, Metal Gear Solid... It went on and on. I remember playing a game called Medievil with my stepdad Roger. I watched him play while he convinced me to eat my first grapefruit with a spoon. I covered the top with sugar and dug out the juicy meat, delicious!
Going into my teenager years, I found PC gaming. At first it was a mess of things like pinball games, and skifree. We didn't have the kind of money to have a fantastic gaming machine so I couldn't play the high end games at that time.

I got my first job, and money started coming into my pocket. I bought my first PC. I went to the local walmart and got an Emachines. I made sure to get the one with the AGP slot so I could get a better graphics card.

Unreal Tournament happened. At this point the family had replaced the other computer, so we had an extra. I set up a network game of Unreal Tournament with Cody in his room. Man that was my first real experience with anger, it took me so long to figure out how to share one game with another computer using RJ-14 ( Phone cord for those that don't speak tech ) I got it though, I was so happy with myself.

This was a breaking point for me, it opened up a floodgate of games. I experimented with Diablo, Warcraft, and many others. Then I found a game in a pile of stuff that was on sale, Half Life. Installed the game to find a storyline, NPC's that interacted with you, extremely detailed graphics, and voiceovers. I put this on my mental checklist of favorites.

Santa brought our Playstation 2 for Christmas one year. I don't think I ever stared at a screen more closely. Seeing all the detail in Spy Hunter, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 made me drool. Playing through Metal Gear Solid 2 was a great time. Gran Turismo 3 sucked quite a bit of my time, and I never finished Final Fantasy X because I erased one of my save spots and it made me go back over half the game.

Slowly, as I grew up playing all these games, I started to gain a sense of what a good game was. I realized when I was playing a bad game that I wasn't enjoying myself, and moved on to another one. Years pass, my tech experience got better, and so my PC got upgrades. I started subscribing to game magazines. They were all talking about one game, Half Life 2.

I remember this game changed my opinion of what a good game was . This game was gorgeous. It made my PS2 jealous, I could feel the rage. *Thinking back, that was probably why it got the ""Disk Read Error"". All of the things I could interact with, the amount of weapons was staggering, and the voice acting was amazing. It felt like I was IN a movie, like I WAS the main character. Things were happening to the characters in the game that made me feel sad. Then the game ended on a note I didn't enjoy. I didn't know what was going to happen.

I started following the development of valve's creations. HL2 multi-player came out, but that was only a minor distraction. Years went by and I was rewarded, but only barely. Half Life 2: Episode One came out. I ran home, installed the game and thought it was a sequel. Oh boy, was I wrong. The only thing this game did for me was make me angry. Not only did I not have answers to the looming questions about the storyline, I was teased into thinking it was the actual sequel.

I realized I had become attached. I wanted to cry I was so frustrated. Then The Orange Box came out. Wow, what a refreshing update. I got a fix, and it only made me want more. Things happened in the game that I never expected, people died, and I genuinely felt sorry for some of them. Gabe Newell and team at Valve had done a fantastic job of creating something that felt real. Something I wanted to hold onto, like it felt special to me. Team Fortress 2 became a big part of my coping process, then the waiting began.

Almost 6 years later that brings us to today, and I am still patiently waiting. Hell, we even saw the release of the fabled Duke Nukem Forever, and still no Half Life sequel. Fans have picketed on Valve's doorstep to no avail. A steam group called ""A Call for Communication"" attempted to get Valve's attention by getting over 28,000 gamers to all play Half Life 2 at once, and still nothing.

Valve, this message is to you. I have followed the tale of Gordon Freeman for a long time. I'm not asking you to deliver an unfinished product. I'm not even asking you to show me screenshots. All I'm asking is for you to confirm the existence of a sequel in the works. I'm fairly certain I can speak for all Half Life fans when I say we have been extremely patient. If the sequel to Half Life is to never exist, all we are asking is for you to tell us. Table scraps, information about the new source engine, or something.  We just don't want to be waiting for all these years in vain.

TL:DR Don't leave us hanging Gabe.
Do us a solid, just tell us it exists."	t5_2rgym	True

1364511977.0	1b7hdk	What do you guys want to see FIRST in Episode 3?	clonetrooper250	49	4	82	"Okay, so Episode 2 left off at a pretty crucial moment, didn't it? I won't spoil it, but I think most of you know by now how that turns out, so I think we can agree its not the sort of moment we can directly pick back off from to start the final eisode.

So I put the question to you guys: Where do you want, not expect, WANT to pick up from at the very beggining of HL3/Ep. 3? As in, the very first thing we see in the very first scene when we'll begin a new game?

Will we begin with another Gman monolouge? Will we see the inside of a helicopter sitting across from Barney and Alyx on our way to the Borealis ? Will we wake up in a cold cell in a Combine prison, realizing the resistance has finally been broken by the Combine?

Again, this is what you WANT to happen first, not what you're EXPECTING to happen first. I'll give you my idea:

Firstly, remember these two?: http://sectorw.wikia.com/wiki/Consoling_Couple

Of course you do. These two are the epitome of hoplessness in the begining of Half Life 2, with the woman saying things like ""What are we going to do?"" and ""When is it all going to end?"", and the man can only sit by her and give a few words of comfort despite knowing they're both very likely doomed.

They show up a few times later, now with the Resistance, and we can assume they'll be alive at the beggining of HL3.

Now, as we know, the Suppression Field is now out of commision, so the Humans of Earth are now able to reproduce again. (I think you see where I'm going with this now). 

I'm going to guess HL3 will begin a significant amount of after Episode 2 ended, because I doubt Valve would want to start off almost immediately after you know what happens, they'll probably want the in-game characters to have already come to terms with such an emotional defeat, because they'll know the fans are probably over the shock after 6+ years.

But how long would be the right time be to allow for such a thing to happen while still allowing characters to be somewhat mournful? I'd say about a year, or at the very least... 9 months.

So here's what I REALLY want to see in Episode 3. These two: http://sectorw.wikia.com/wiki/Consoling_Couple in a hosital room where the woman is about to give birth. (Gordon would be present just because I guess. Hell, he's a doctor, maybe he's even delivering the kid himself?)

Anyways, I think this would really strike a chord with everyone because this child would be the first human to be born in over 20 years, and that would be an IMMENSE sign of hope for the Resistance.

Of course, this is just my idea, which I'm sure many people would have an issue with, and there'll be plenty of other ideas. So what do you guys think then? How do you want VALVe to handle the moment where they invite us back into the amazing world they've created?"	t5_2rgym	True

I know we've all been waiting for a long, long time, but that's because they are making it as well as they can, not as fast as they can. I feel like we're starting to lose one of my favorite parts about this community, which is that it can appreciate that good work takes time, and while we will joke about how badly we want it now, we know that it's better to let it marinate in GabeN's sweet, sweet nectar.

We love HL, because it's fantastic. We love HL2, because it's arguably even more so. We are not going to love HL3 because it will come out when we want it to, we are going to love it because it will be breathtaking. Would *anybody at all* find themselves saying, if it came out before it was ready, ""HL3 wasn't as good as I wanted, but at least it came out when I wanted""?

Nobody here is entitled to a new game. Nobody here has a right to see it when they get impatient. Why do some of you sound angry about this? It will not happen on your time. It will happen at the *right* time. And then you will have wasted your energy thinking that you know better than the company that made your favorite games about how and when to release them.

When I got to the part where you put the crystal in that beam I thought I screwed up and did something I wasn't supposed to do.

1343236836.0	x521i	Is it a feasible idea that Half-Life 3 will arrive when the next generation of consoles does?	halstedom	49	11	73	"With the Portals coming to X360 and PS3, it seems obvious that Valve are trying to make a dent on the console market. Would it be a likely thought that they're hanging unto HL3 until they can unleash their newest engine alongside it?

The Source engine was absolutely phenomenal when Half-Life 2 was released, so I'm thinking that Valve deeply wish to have the same impact again when Half-Life 3 is released - something they're probably not able to do well on the console market, as that generation is coming to a halt in terms of hardware.

Now, when the next generation comes, they would be able to innovate once again. Many other companies are likely wanting to do the same, but there's a chance Valve could win that war.

MonarKay	43	7	39	"So I just got back into Black Mesa this evening to immediately remember why I hadn't played it in so long- the helicopter. Playing on Normal, at 100 health and 75 power, that damn helicopter took me several /dozen/ attempts to beat. It just felt like I had no real control over how well I was doing- I would take damage not because I messed up, but because my only cover they gave me wan't adequate. Because I couldn't see the copter and it's movement was unpredictable. Because it took something like 8 hits and I had to run and refill my ammo.

Finally, /finally/, I beat it, (still lost all of my power and most of my health) only to walk straight into another brick wall- the military ambush in the water channel area. No matter what I do, I just die. Over and over. In order to shoot anything, I have to leave cover. Because the soldiers are master marksman and apparently psychic, if I leave cover- for even a moment- I get shot. A lot. There is no way for me to deal damage without also taking damage- and they have waaay more health than me.

So how the flying hell am I suppose to win here? Am I missing something? I've played and beaten every main entry in the Half-Life series, and I know how to play the games. So why exactly is Black Mesa giving me such a hard time? On /normal/? It wasn't just these parts- the canyon wall before the copter was also infuriating, as was the ambush in the main lobby.

* My theory is that it's set a year or two after the events of Ep2.

* The game is now set in China/colder parts of Russia.

*  The Combine have used the Borealis however not as they expected bringing Portal storms. (which means more Xen creatures)

* The game sees you and Alyx push the resistance to the Borealis  where the combine are centred.

* They make it however go to the Combine world (Xen maybe on the way) 

* G-Man starts appearing in the Xen/Combine World sections where the Vorts can't stop him.

1360423544.0	18708o	My theory on the G-Man and the conclusion to Half-Life.	Maghook	50	16	36	"Just a thought, but as the G-Man and the Vortigaunt are four dimensional beings, then it's completely plausible that they (or just the G-Man) may also have the power to break the fourth wall. That means that the G-Man may have been using the ""Free Man"" as a conduit of sorts to speak with... well, you and me. My only reasoning is [this game over screen,](http://i.imgur.com/M3BAswn.jpg) it's far too odd in its statement, and there's multiple variations depending on the conditions of failure. Kind of ironic, considering then that Freeman may very well not be free of will. Valve is very deliberate in their decisions and I can't see this as being an oversight.

Also, I'm just speculating, but I'm enjoying this theory I've created where the end of Half-Life 3 comes at the fall of the Combine with the human race repopulating the planet, this includes Alyx and Gordon settling down, as Eli had joked about previously. So, Alyx gives birth... only to have the G-Man intervene and take their child with him, to another moment in time, somewhere in the past. He places the child under the care of foster parents who are employed at a research facility, awaiting the day where the child will at last be of use to the G-Man and his employers. Possibly placing the child in a position that tests its abilities before requiring use of its talents.

The facility? Aperture Science. The child's name? Chell.

The reasoning? The connection between Aperture Science and Black Mesa being competitors, along with the disappearance and rediscovery of the Borealis. That and the fact that the G-Man has access to some kind of space-time portal technology that both Aperture Science and Black Mesa had separately been working on.

Also, the G-Man sabotaged Black Mesa in order to test Gordon, causing the Resonance Cascade and the deaths of many, is it not possible that he'd also sabotage Aperture Science to then test Chell? You know, by compromising GLaDOS's artificial intelligence and morality, causing GLaDOS to initially release the neurotoxin that killed almost everyone inside of the complex? Maybe Doug Rattmann was Aperture Science's own version of Gordon, chosen by the G-Man as a sort of anti-Freeman (even their names are similar), but his emotions got the better of him and he failed, only to have Chell succeed.

Even GLaDOS taunts Chell about her past and her ""dead"" parents abandoning her throughout the testing facility... perhaps she is somewhat aware of Chell's history. Perhaps a part of the G-Man's subconscious and personality was implanted into GLaDOS's artificial intelligence alongside Caroline's?

I thought the ending sequence was okay, but the moment when the dad (does he have a name?) died wasn't actually very visceral.. or something. I knew what was happening, and was kind of waiting for Dog to show up and save him, but then he died and I was like :o

They were worked on for quite time and where never really in the game with the exception of the one seen in the Citadel (http://images.wikia.com/half-life/en/images/4/49/D3_citadel_050339.JPG). When reading some articles one day, I discovered a visual similarity between the Crab Synth and the Vortugor (http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Voltigore), a Race X creature (Half-Life: Opposing Force). How do they look the same?, I'll explain.

A 'synth' is a creature created by the Combine, which is like a cyborg, half living being, half machine. These creatures where all alien species from different worlds which the Combine had invaded, and taken over. These poor creatures where taken into synth factories and surgically made into war machines. There is also a theory that states the Combine have found ways to breed or clone synths to make large armies effortlessly. Read more on the wiki (http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Synth).

Synths are also known not to be their original shape (when they were non-synthetic organisms). This would mean that the Vortugor could have easily been made into what we know as a Crab Synth. Their 4 legs legs could have been merged to make 2 large, powerful legs. Their  arms could have been adjusted along with their spine to be kneeling down, or ""forward."" I created a diagram to represent what I mean, visible here: http://i.imgur.com/ua5XF.jpg The Vortigore is the one from the upcoming HL:OF mod, Operation Black Mesa (http://www.moddb.com/mods/operation-black-mesa), because it looks far better than the 1998 HL:OF model, but is the same thing.

You may say that anything could then be made into a synth, like an elephant into a Strider. This logic would not make sense, because the combine want to make minimal changes, like adding armour and weapons, not completely converting the look of the creature (would take too long and be pointless, easier to make robots).

Now, I know Valve and the people who made HL:OF likely did not intend this, but it could be possible because the Crab Synth has bery little background information, which could be worked on later *caugh* HL3 *caugh* Maybe the Combine could have had some interactions with Race X, after all they did come through the portal like the Xenians.

1349537357.0	111lkp	So I have my own theory/explanation for Gordon Freeman. What makes him smart, capable, and even why he does not speak...	Throwaway_4_opinions	44	12	20	"**Spoilers (duh)**

Let me begin by saying this is just my speculation. I am certain valve did not think of any of this for Gordon and the actual reasons Gordon is the way he is all is due to being more of a blank slate for the player to fill. Now for my explanation. I know it sounds weird just allow me to elaborate and it will make more sense. 

Gordon Freeman's intelligence, marksmanship, and mute tendencies can all be attributed by being classified as a high functioning autistic, possibly a savant. What we know about Gordon Freeman from 1 and 2 are the several facts: 27 year old MIT grad with a PHD in theoretical physics, above average athletics for a scientist (although this could be attributed to the HEV suit), physical appearance is only cleaned rather than personally adjusted (this can be debated earlier models of freeman gave him quite the beard and ponytail and if you count BMS he had a ponytail he cut off most likely because a higher up told him to), outstanding marksmanship for a non military trained civilian (again HEV suit *could* be credited to this). This is what we know about Gordon and these features do fall under some aspects to high functioning autism.

Now before I go further with this explanation I should really address the subject of autism a little further to both address the often misunderstood facts of autism and further establish the differences between autism, high functioning autism/Asperger's Syndrome (which I will from henceforth refer to AS for the sake of simplicity). 

Wikipedia sums up autism as *""...a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior...""* it is important to understand what exactly this is supposed to mean. To put this into more simplistic terms the brain is rewired. Things that are easy for a ""average"" individual to connect together in a thought process are not as apparent and in some cases entirely absent with an autistic individual. [This does not mean the individual is ignorant in the least.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=JnylM1hI2jc#t=192s) In a sense [the individual is blind to things an average individual can identify or easily grasp.](http://youtu.be/FoxE8_1eeWk) in this example John completely misses his mother's request to go back home. Why wouldn't she want to watch the freight trains? He likes trains so everyone must at least show some interest in them. He even heard her say she doesn't want to watch the trains. Well maybe she just hasn't seen a good train ever she doesn't know what she is missing!

So I said Gordon Freeman is what I classified as a High Functioning autistic, AS or savant. What is the difference? Well this is the part of constant debate for the developmental disorder. Autism is not something simply classified by a standardized diagnosis. The traits can be wildly different and will not always fall under the exact same behavioral traits. With AS and High Functioning Autism this becomes more complicated. These are the individuals classified with autism, but seem to be impaired to a lesser degree, having noticeable ""different"" behavior. AS differs from other forms of autism mainly because linguistics are not impaired, typically however while this social impairment can be very crippling, Autism in all of its forms quite often has a practical upshot. I mentioned before how autism in a sense rewires the brain. So while the individual may be handicapped and socially ""blind"", an autistic individual can often ""see"" something in a way others cannot. 

At this point I must stress this does not mean that anyone diagnosed with autism is an untapped super genius, typically an autistic individual will gravitate to a particular interest and it will become a passionate obsession. Depending on the level of social impairment, and a multitude of other variables, these interests can be made into a career in certain cases. For high functioning Autistics, this is more often achievable. To further clarify, just like any ""average"" individual, those I classified above achieve their career through a honed, practiced, and long obsessed skill. In rare cases there are Savants.

Savants are the ""gifted"" ones often glorified in films. The Rain Man of an uncanny level of bottled perfection of a certain activity or skill. they do not have to put great effort into something to achieve it. [In some cases they just do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8YXZTlwTAU)

Now that I have established a few terms I will point my perspective of Gordon. Gordon in my mind grew up a high functioning autistic and from an early age gravitated to Mathematics which lead to numbers, to physics, to theoretical physics. After many years of obsessive interest in physics and study, he achieved his MIT PHD and eventually gets the government job at Black Mesa. Gordon is smarter than the average scientists there, more physically capable too, so higher ups can overlook or simply not care if he isn't the social type and doesn't talk, he is doing the work and very well at that. And if that ponytail of his grows too long we will give him a talking, guess he just needs someone to order him to. The most he will do is give you a look and then reluctantly comply. He knows it will just get in the way of that hazard suit anyway. 

After the residence cascade Gordon discovers he is quite good with firearms, he can shoot extremely well for someone who never touched a firearm in his life. It's just natural. He can just account for all variables and just do. Thus his Savant skill is discovered and utilized. As far as morality, Gordan is not too bogged down by it. Everything he faces is a case of self defense and therefore shows no sympathy to his antagonists. 

**EDIT:** A lot of people think I am saying Gordon can not speak at all. Please let me clarify this a little bit more. Gordon would not be mute being high functioning autistic. Simply socially inept or more likely socially declined. He can speak if pressed to do so but his silence is for either the case of analytical observation, or does not see any logical reason to speak as it would either provide a redundancy to conversation, or his actions simply speak louder than words do.

It is time to raise the crowbars my comrades.

The plan is to send Valve as many crowbars as possible.

Valve's been keeping secrets and it is time to pry it from them.
(Crowbar pun, we are not trying to force Valve's hand just show unrest)

We need to determine how organized we want to be.
One a day?
Or random when people get a chance to buy and mail one out?

LET'S DO THIS!


We shall not stop until Valve is up to their nipples in crowbars...or when the cease and desist orders come.

I'm giving away 6 Half-Life games this week on my site: [PlanetPhillip.Com](http://planetphillip.com).

For the whole of this week, I’ll be giving a game away each day. I bought them last week when they were on sale.

It's a simple draw and no registration is necessary.  Just leave a comment on each relevant post to be entered into the random draw.

You must have a working email address though, otherwise I can't send you the game.

1372502480.0	1hazxb	There has to be more. [ARG Crazytalk]	Bramman111	43	13	20	"Think about it. The information we have only comes from the last week. The TF2 MvM ARG OMG BBQ took years to develop, with hints being dropped like breadcrumbs in a forest.

Half-Life is Valve's biggest, most well-known franchise. It's synonymous with their entire company. If there is an ARG it has to go back farther.

So my thought was, why have all the past ARGs for HL3 just been dropped? Why are we not keeping them on the forefront when looking at new material? I'll admit, I've forgotten all but the most recent ARG, and after spending about twenty minutes going over old forum posts I'm getting nowhere. Not to mention it's about 3:30 AM in my timezone, and I'm more tired than a semi.

If this has sparked any ideas in anyone, great. Keep the comments rolling below. If not, well, I'll stick to my original plan and say that if Half-Life 3 comes out at 8:47 AM New Mexico time (GMT - 7 I think, so about five hours from now);

It was all right at the beginning, since after some time you get the dark energy powered gravity gun (giving Combine a good hammering with it is hell of a fun).

Then after a while we made it to a parking lot with a bunch of antlion burrows. I did one stupid thing there: ran forwards (more upwards, actually). Yeah, didn't block the holes. So another challenge emerged — try to open the fucking gates with a ton of antlions behind your back trying to have you as a dinner.

I made it — dunno how, though, with a lot of cursing, and ~10 hp left (not to mention how many times  I loaded the previous savefile). Yeah, could go down and block the burrows — but no, too lazy for that. And who takes the easy path anyway.

Zombines were yet another source of PITA. A heavy dumbass with an armed grenade — gosh, a perfect match.

What if the Source 2 engine is too much for the current consoles to handle, and they're waiting for the next generation to come out.  This could explain why they have been so slow coming with 'Ricochet 2', because as of now, they have no reason to rush development, because if they actually finished it, they wouldn't have consoles to release it on.  So I would hope we at least hear something at the E3 after at least the the next gen Xbox or Playstation comes out.

A few days back when Half Life 3 appeared on the list for Gamescon, Vic at Lambda Generation reported that he was ""explicitly informed"" by a manager at Gamescon that ""Valve were the ones who asked that HL3 be placed on the list; but that apparently, ""just a few minutes ago"", Valve requested that HL3 be removed from that list.""


Now, today, we've seen a video of a new gaming keyboard. On this keyboard is the Half Life 3 symbol. I don't know much about copyright, but I don't think Mad Cat would put Valve's symbol on a commercial for their project without talking to Valve. What I'm implying here is that maybe the symbol wasn't put there randomly...
[Video in question](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGhJDCdtXA)


Also today, there was a blog post [here](http://www.l4d.com/blog/post.php?id=8648) with a link on the bottom of the page. It has since been corrected, but for some time the link actually took you [here]( http://sybolt.com/mvm//mvm). Notice what game the user is playing. The L4D blog is operated by Valve, they control what's put on it.


Additionally, as far as I know dota2 is the only unfinished video game product Valve is known to be working on (CS:GO is a couple days from release), so it sounds like they'd be a little more free to work on a big main project.

Yes, it's a bit dated gameplay-wise. But what really made it worthwhile for me was the writing, the graphics and the SOUND.

It's a game cut above the rest in so many ways. The different environments, the tense soundtrack (a little sporadic, which is a good thing) and voice acting made HL2 more of a ""movie-like"" experience than most games. It felt more real, as if I WERE Gordon Freeman.

What I didn't like about HL2: the plot, pacing and autosave/checkpoint system. The story is not that interesting when compared to the first game and the storytelling is lacking, with plenty of missing details and/or background. As for the pacing, the game literally tired me, physically, which is surprising. I didn't get a nice ""three-act"" feel from it, which I got from other games like The Darkness and most Halos. Re: checkpoints, autosaves were few and far between, requiring lots of manual saves so I wouldn't lose progress. Not a big deal but annoying for sure.

Still, the problems are minor. It's an EPIC game any way you slice it. It was made even better by the Xbox 360, booming surround sound and a 61-inch TV.

**Episode 1**

Yes, it's very short. It took me 5 hours to complete it. At the same time, EP1 is polished as hell. Not having any weapons other than the Gravity Gun in the beginning freaked me out a bit, but I got through the first chapter and soon I had my weapons again.

Getting the crowbar back actually got me teary. That's an insane achievement for an FPS. I emoted loudly, drawing my wife's attention. I couldn't believe how much I missed it :)

Graphics got a nice bump in EP1. Everything looks sharper and more detailed. Lighting was improved as well -- it definitely felt more natural. I'm still amazed at what Source can achieve.

In short, EP1 was over too soon, whetting my appetite for Episode 2. If you own the Orange Box (one of the best values in gaming, ever) prepare to be amazed.

A question remains, however: where is Half Life 3 / Episode 3 Valve? :)

**Update 1: halfway through Episode 2**

So I started playing Episode 2. Just got past the Combine Cannon area, which takes place right after the helicopter.

My thoughts: I'm torn between EP1 and EP2. I think that cave sequence in the beginning was way too long. It dragged so bad I would have stopped playing right there if this was not a Half-Life game. Once you're out of the cave, things improve greatly... At least until you're stuck in a dark building again.

I wonder if I feel like that because of Halo. I like the open-world feel of EP2 but Valve keeps putting the player in dark environments. Or places with a ton of toxic waste. The reason I liked EP1 so much is that City 17 feels REAL. Traversing those buildings, meeting people along the way, felt like something that could actually happen. In the first half of EP2 though, it's all about going underground, dealing with toxic waste, etc.

Highlights so far: running away from the Guardian, being with the Vorts.

I LOVE how the Vorts are written. It cracks me up every time I hear ""The Freeman."" They have a calming effect on the game, a multitude of Yodas helping you out along the way.

I think EP2 really gets into high-gear right before the bridge -- and using the car to jump over broken segments. Suddenly the games makes a 180 (sorry about the car metaphors, I'm a car nut) and becomes much more expansive. No more dark corners and creepy crawlies -- it feels real again.

It was fun to meet the Hunters for the first time. My favorite strategy to deal with them is running them over with the car. So satisfying. I also enjoyed the whole Advisor introduction tremendously, from its deafening noise (turning the screen sepia for a moment) to the discovery of the ""nest."" That whole sequence when it almost kills Gordon was masterful.

Finally, running away from the helicopter was really fun as well. I only wish Valve would have adopted PROPER CAR CONTROLS. Is it so hard to assign accelerate to right trigger, brake to left trigger and turbo to A? Driving the car never feels ""right"" and it took away from the whole chase sequence, which was fun in itself. 

(when the car broke down, I thought ""Shit, the whole car thing was shorter than I expected!"" It was a nice surprise to know it was going to be fixed)

I also kept missing the damn helicopter. I would either shoot too high or too low, taking longer to get through the battle. Still, I enjoyed it. I even liked the whole Combine Cannon sequence because it gave me something new to play with, having to avoid getting blown to bits while dealing with Combine soldiers and those sneaky zombies.

TL;DR: right now, I still prefer EP1. Let's see how I feel once I complete this sucker :)

**Update 2: Episode 2 completed**

Finished the game Friday night. I knew Eli was going to die and yet, when it actually happened, I was in shock for a good couple hours. What a horrible way to go -- and right in front of his daughter.

The fact that I'm still thinking about it shows how *engaged* I was throughout Episode 2. After completing the game, I now think that, yes, it's better than Episode 1. I just had to get through those stupid caves and get to the car for things to GREATLY improve :)

From the Combine Cannon to the very end of the game, I can say I enjoyed 90 percent of it. Not a big fan of the final battle -- I have terrible aim with the gravity gun and kept missing the Striders -- but everything else was superb, especially the other driving segments and the battles inside White Forest. I also love the downbeat ending, emotional distress and all.

My conclusion: Half-Life 2 plus Episodes 1 and 2 might be the best gaming combo of all time. The mythology is deep, far-reaching and engrossing; graphics have held well; face animation/voice acting are excellent and reach L.A. Noire-like levels most of the time. An amazing series of games and one that I will recommend to ANYONE interested in science fiction and/or first-person shooters."	t5_2rgym	True

The tone that Half Life 2 conveys is more about resistance (lambda symbols and resistance movement groups) rather than continuing the story right where it left off. Most enemies were Combine variants.

1344737959.0	y2qgu	Remember my theory about the super Portal? I'm back to convince you. 	Blue_ODaniel	32	8	59	"4 months ago I posted to you guys about my theory that the Borealis is actually carrying a Super Portal from Aperture.

Later I posted a video [this video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJJkh5T3w-k&amp;feature=youtu.be] that gave you all a video representation of my theory.

Today I'm here with real-world proof that my theory might work.

As stated, My theory revolves around the idea that the ship itself is carrying a Super Portal from Aperture, that Super Portal being powered by the very thing it's named after, the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights. 
Below is something that has been recently added to Wikipedia  under the Aurora Borealis page, proving that using the Northern Lights as a power source is completely possible. 

""The aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history, very near the maximum intensity that the Sun is thought to be capable of producing. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the 125,000 miles (201,000 km) of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Traveler:
Boston operator (to Portland operator): ""Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes.""
Portland operator: ""Will do so. It is now disconnected.""
Boston: ""Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?""
Portland: ""Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually.""
Boston: ""My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.""
Portland: ""Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?""
Boston: ""Yes. Go ahead.""

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.[27] Such events led to the general conclusion that
The effect of the Aurora on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid is discoverable in them . The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.""

As I stated before, My theory could be like every other, and be completely bunk. But My theory has outside proof, but the decision as to what you believe is completely your own, I just wanted to share my opinion."	t5_2rgym	True

1339038381.0	up5r0	Regarding Adrian Shepard's role in the future of Half-Life	Contun	28	5	16	"Throughout the Half-Life series, the G-man has played a pivotal, albeit mysterious role in Gordon Freeman's endeavors. At most points, the G-Man has acted merely as a silent observer seen from afar. However, he always seems to interfere when those under his influence are in their most dire positions, and although his actions have directly interfered with the goals of the characters at times, he has prevented their deaths on numerous occasion. Despite this, several characters harbor suspicions regarding the motives and goals of the G-Man. Both Eli Vance and Wallace Breen disapprove of the influence that the G-man has over Gordon, and even as far back as the original Half-Life the Nihilanth seemingly warns Gordon of the G-Man and his intentions. So far, the Vortigaunts are the only entities shown to directly prevent the G-Man's plan for Gordon.

After reflecting on this, it makes more and more sense for Adrian Shepard to be brought out of his stasis. Gordon Freeman has proven to be an excellent tool for the G-Man to accomplish his goals, though he has become a legendary figure in the process. While there are perks to this, he has gained the attention of outside forces whose interferences could prove troublesome. Adrian Shepard, on the other hand, is universally unknown by anyone who may oppose the G-Man's goals, as he was just another one of the faceless Marines sent to deal with the Black Mesa incident. Shepard has proved he can overcome any obstacle set in front of him just as Gordan has, but he could do it without the outside influences.

I wasn't sure if speculation is wanted here or not, but it seemed like the optimal place to share this thought."	t5_2rgym	True
