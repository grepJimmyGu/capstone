So, I'm an idiot; I play with my wedding ring, and I have for as long as I’ve had it (seven years).  This past Saturday, while walking on Walnut Street, I dropped it and it one-hopped into a sewer, sinking into the murky water.  
I figured it was gone for good, but someone suggested calling PWSA.  Sure enough, they sent someone down and we spent over an hour trying to blindly find it with a long grabber/claw tool.  Eventually we gave up, and I started looking into replacing it (I also told my wife at this point).  Well, I got a call yesterday from PWSA trying to set up a time to meet there to search again, I was hesitant and felt like I'd be wasting their time, but they insisted.  We planned to meet this afternoon, probably around 1pm, and they'd call to let me know.  
I received a call around 12:00, asking me if I was the guy that lost a ring, when I said yes, they told me they had it and asked where they could bring it (they delivered it downtown), and when they dropped it off, they refused any reward.  
They explained that they tried going down in there yesterday, but couldn't find it and probably only buried it deeper, but today they vacuumed it all out and that allowed them to find it pretty easily.  I just can't believe how much work they put into finding it, when they easily could have ignored my requests, especially since it was 100% my fault that it happened.  I've seen a number of posts on this subreddit talking about how nice the people are in Pittsburgh, and I just had to share this story, reinforcing that truth.

 * Follow traffic laws, you're required to by law.  For your safety... and yours. (not mine,  I'm in a car.)
 * Don't run red lights [and stop signs,] see (1)
 * When I pass you, and you reach the red light, don't pass me. It scares the FUCK out of me to pass a biker, now you're going to make me do it again?
 * I accelerate faster than you, don't pass me.  See above.
 * Don't swerve into lanes, do what everyone else does, check the fucking lane. See (1)
 * Remember, you're on a bike.  Making a statement while you're on a flimsy aluminum frame won't mean shit when some dumbass in a 2 ton aluminum frame hits you.

1363030216.0	1a3jig	TIL: spot delivery scams are fraudulent and illegal. A warning to anyone buying a car in PGH	saraquael	135	13	43	"This is a text post because I don't want any karma, I just want to warn anyone buying a car that these kinds of scams exist and that there are dealerships out there who are looking to take advantage of people. 

Two weeks ago, a close relative of mine bought a car from Spitzer Toyota in Monroeville, PA. She traded in her old car, went through financing, was approved, signed the papers and drove the car off the lot the same day. She'd given them an almost 30% down payment on the vehicle, too. Everything was gravy. Then on Friday (of course, the day before the weekend, right?) the dealership left a message telling her that her financing had fallen through, and to call them immediately. 

So she called Saturday, as soon as she got the message. The finance guy told her that her loan had been denied because she wasn't employed. He suggested that she'd been fraudulent on her credit application. Now, she's a union construction worker, so she goes from job site to job site, working for different contracting companies. She had had a couple days off between jobs, but she definitely wasn't ""unemployed."" She had also discussed this with the salesman, who had told her that he sold to union people all the time and it wasn't a problem due to the nature of the business, blah blah. Anyway, the finance guy then went on to tell her that the loan company was pushing them to repo the car, but he'd called her to see if he could ""work something out."" 

She said she'd call her loan company Monday morning to sort it out. Well he then made it sound like the repo trucks were already out looking for the car (funny how it went from a possibility to impending doom in 30 seconds). He tried to push her into coming in immediately so they could, again, ""work something out."" When she tried to call him back a few minutes later, he didn't answer and didn't call her back. 

Monday morning, she called her loan company. They insisted that no, she was absolutely approved for the loan, they had just needed to verify her employment. All they needed was a phone number for their records. She called Spitzer back and spoke to the finance guy again. She deliberately didn't mention having called her loan company, just to see what the guy would say now. 

Once again, he insisted that funding for her loan had been ""pulled"" and that the loan company had declined her. ""But look, I don't want to see that car come back here; I want to see you get to keep it. I want to help you out in any way I can. We can try to work something out,"" Scumbag Finance Guy said. ""Your union sent a letter to the loan company saying you aren't employed, and so the loan was denied. Loan buyers can pull funding at any time."" This is an outright lie - three of them, in fact. Her loan was still approved: the loan company had only been looking for a phone number to verify; no one had sent any letters from the union (she checked; the union doesn't even verify employment); and she had already gone back to work on another job. She was fortunate enough that she had the money to pay off the entire balance of the car loan if needed, but she still called a lawyer just in case.

Most people don't know that this is illegal. ""Spot Delivery,"" or ""Yo-Yo Financing,"" is an unfortunately common tactic in which dealerships attempt to defraud the buyer by selling them a car and then notifying them, often weeks later, that their financing had fallen through. They then ""yo-yo"" the buyer back into the dealership, telling them that they'll have to finance at a higher interest rate, pay penalties and fees, and/or give the dealership more money to avoid repossession on a car they've already been approved to buy. This is a predatory tactic because they know that, after a few weeks, the buyer is often in a real bind at the thought of having their vehicle repossessed and doesn't want to go through the embarrassment of losing the new car they'd already showed off to their families and friends. The buyer also thinks the dealership is on their side and trying to help, as the dealership pretends to be sympathetic to the buyer's plight. Dealerships tend to use this tactic on young people and people who have bad credit, but it can happen to anyone. 

**Don't fall for it. If you signed purchase documents and registration applications and if you obtained insurance for the vehicle, had a new license plate put on the car and/or had your old plate transferred, the car belongs to you.** The dealership signed the paperwork, and the RISC (Retail Installment Sales Contract) is binding. In addition, they're legally required to find you financing at the same (or better) interest rate if your financing falls through. Period.

I didn't know any of this until today, and I figured it might be of some help to anyone else who may not know their rights. If you think you're the victim of a Spot Delivery Scam, you should definitely call a lawyer or your State Attorney General's office. I don't work for them and am not affiliated, but [Kimmel &amp; Silverman](http://www.lemonlaw.com/spotdelivery.html) (think: 1-800 Lemon Law commercials) were awesome and will represent you for free. They also have a lot of info on their site about this type of fraud and helpful tips on what to do. They're the reason my friend didn't get scammed out of any money. 

And what do you know? As soon as she mentioned that she had a lawyer and wasn't paying a penny more, the dealership's tune changed and suddenly they didn't want to put her ""through anything else."" Suddenly they were nothing but accommodating - and apologetic - instead of acting like threatening douche canoes.  

**TL;DR: Once you sign the paperwork, a car dealership can't ask you to return to refinance at a higher rate, require you to get a co-signer, or ask you for any more money because the contract you signed is legal and binding. And if they do, they're scamming you and you should call a lawyer and tell that dealership to eat a thick stack of dicks.**"	t5_2qhrn	True

People have pointed out that you can go to the City Paper, Jambase, last.fm, or a handful of other websites to get all of these show listings. I use all of those along with venue pages, blogs, and social media to round up everything. No list is perfect, this one isn't either, I'm just trying to bring together a what's happening in Pittsburgh music for the week post.

Last week I mentioned that I didn't include the Justin Bieber concert on this calendar and someone said that I should include every show including those of bands that I don't like. I'd just like to point out that I'm not familiar with the majority of these bands and I try to post everything I can. I skipped Bieber last week because I didn't think his music was geared towards this community. I went ahead and included things like Carrie Underwood and Twiztid this week though and I won't filter out concerts in the future.

I'm going to miss shows here and there, so if the community could help out and post shows in the comments too that would be great! If you're in a band, post your shows here too! Include a link to your music so that people can hear your songs.

I would like to make these posts on Mondays and list shows all the way through Sunday. I'd also like to include recently announced shows so that people can plan ahead.

She got out of a car downtown and three guys ask her for her number. Then they figure out she's male to female transgender, and beat her up. I ask her if I can examine her face. Knots all over. Blood coming from her nose. She will not speak to police. I let the police know just as a heads up. I insist on her going to the ER, but no way. Whatever the reason, she just wants to go home. She sounds used to this kind of thing. I call the police again having learned the details and that it's a hate crime, giving them what I know.

It's a sad slice of life. It's brutal and ugly. Her attackers were three black men. I wonder how they'd feel if they were targed for being black by some white bigots and beaten in the same way. Maybe that's playing the race card in a bad way, maybe not. In any case, it's ugly and sad as fuck. Here in the burg."	t5_2qhrn	True

I attempted to ask Jack Wagner as well, but he slipped out before I could talk to him. I've sent an email to his campaign, and we'll see if he responds.

Anyway, when should I suggest that he do the AMA to get the best participation?
Which is better?

1342006632.0	wdpbu	Needed to share: being neighborly (aka Why I love Pittsburgh)	birdbrainlabs	111	10	31	"So I work most of the time from my house in SqHill.  It's summer so the windows are open.  A little before 5pm yesterday, I hear tires squeal and then someone groaning/yelling.   

Pedestrian vs. Car rage is nothing new at the intersection near my house, but this sounded a little serious, so I poked my head out the front window, and hear someone yelling ""Call 911"" and traffic backing up.   

So I throw on shoes and run down the stairs.   Find half a dozen people in the street, one car and a pedestrian down.  Someone with a lot of medical training is tending to the pedestrian, another person is talking to the 911 operator, and the driver of the car is on the phone in hysterics.  

Traffic is stopped heading towards Forbes on Wightman, and it's rush hour.   I can't help the guy who is helping the guy on the ground, 911's already called, so I start directing traffic.   Another bystander helps with the other direction of traffic so we can actually get people across Wightman as we need to.   

Realize that this is within 60 seconds of the pedestrian being hit: there's a doctor tending to him, two people directing traffic, one person coordinating with 911.  All the neighbors that were home are out, offering assistance/blankets/water if anyone needs it.  While I was directing traffic, a physician is driving by, asks if we need help (I tell her yes, not knowing the guy who is already helping the guy's qualifications) and stops and helps a bit.  

The first responders (big fire truck) show up within about 3 minutes, ambulance and police within 5.  

Beyond being a bit traumatized by the experience (which is part of why I'm sharing), here's the lesson:

- Within 60 seconds of this guy getting hit, there were about a dozen people involved in one capacity or another
- There were at least 2, possibly 3 doctors on scene within minutes
- Our emergency services are awesome, and were there within 5 minutes of the accident occurring.   First responders within 3.

I don't know who the pedestrian is, or what happened after he left.  He was conscious and coherent when they put him in the ambulance. "	t5_2qhrn	True

BeerMe828	126	24	21	"Yesterday (Saturday, 1/12/13) afternoon about 3:40, I'm sitting at a light downtown at Grant and Seventh. I'm in the left hand turn lane, about to turn left onto Seventh to get onto 376. The green arrow comes on, and the lane starts to move. After a few seconds, the light turns green, with the arrow remaining on. There was a cop waiting at the other side of the light, on Grant, looking to go straight through. Cop's light had been red with a green arrow, and I'm guessing when the cop saw the yellow arrow turn off, he was expecting a green light, but that's not how the traffic pattern goes.

The car in front of me makes his legal left turn with the green arrow as the cop pulls out and almost hits the guy. Cop turns on his flashers and pulls the car over right in front of the US Steel Building. My arrow is still green, but I stay put and wait until there is no traffic and pull in front of the car that's been pulled over. I got out and politely told the cop that there was still a green arrow when the car that was pulled over went. I explained that ""maybe there was a malfunction with the lights""... avoiding stating the obvious, that the cop had run the light... the two cops in the car were taking the guy's license and thanked me for my input rather curtly. They tried to explain how they ""had the right of way"" or some bullshit, and after a bit more chatting I left.

I feel terrible that I just drove away without getting the Cops' names, or car number, or anything. I have no clue how the stop ended up, but if the guy that got pulled over got a ticket, it was truly the most bullshit ticket ever. 

I know its an off chance that the person who got pulled over is a redditor, but what the hell. Maybe. Or maybe a redditor has a friend who has been bitching about a bullshit ticket yesterday... if so, I'd really like to help out. I'll go to traffic court or whatever and do whatever I can to get the person out of the ticket. 

I'm hoping the cops just let him off, but if they fucked this guy over, I just want to do what I can.

***TL;DR: Saw cops run a light and almost hit a person making a legal left turn. They pulled him over and were taking his license when I stopped to speak up. They thanked me but I left without getting any information (like a moron). If it was you that got pulled over yesterday, or your friend, and you want to fight the ticket, I'll help.***

I bought that car with the money I got from serving in the Army, you worthless degenerate. I have to live on the South Side since its close to school and work. I'm just trying to make a life for myself. I go outside this morning to go to class and the mirror is just dangling there, and its the side closest to the sidewalk. Upon closer inspection, there is a shoe mark dusted on it. Something made you so mad that you felt you needed to kick the mirror off my car, parked right in front of my house.  You pathetic piece of Jersey Shore shit. That 300 bucks to fix it will be out of my pocket. Go to hell.  	t5_2qhrn	True

I didn't have as much time to explore the city as I wanted to. Turned out the NHL draft was so much fun I spent a lot of time there. What I did do was go down to the strip district and eat GOOD. Like Rowdy_Roddy_Pipper said I can see most of the attraction would be to go shopping at all the incredible grocery stores and cooking the food late, but unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity.

I must say the people of Pittsburgh are some of the nicest I've ever met. Everyone just wanted to talk and be helpful. Even at the Consol Energy Center wearing my Tampa Bay jersey nobody gave me shit unlike other fans have. Just polite banter. Really classy people.

I will be back because there's a lot I see that I missed out on. I wish I made it to Squirrel Hill, the art and history museums and up that incline (which I was so impressed by). Mostly I just like to eat on vacation and your food there is awesome.

I have ONE gripe. Walking back to my hotel (I love that the city is so walkable) I tried to buy beer at a 7-11 and then a liquor store. Can you not do this there??? Someone told my I'd have to go to a bar to buy a case. Definitely not a deal breaker just very interesting.

Thank you Pittsburgh for a wonderful stay, will be back!"	t5_2qhrn	True

As far as I can tell there are no other activities going on for restore the fourth in Pittsburgh, so if anyone wants to join me get in touch. 

Edit: A couple people have noted their intention to participate. I will send you my cell number in a private message if you are one of those people. The time I'm thinking about being there would be from 6 to 9:30pm, unless there are any suggestions or objections.

Meetup point can be in front of the Fort Pitt Block House:

Fort Pitt Block House, 601 Commonwealth Place, Pittsburgh, PA 15222

DOUBLE EDIT:

Resources for printables can be found at http://www.restorethefourth.net/resources/
Currently I have 100 of their trifold designs, but those will pass quickly, so if you would like to bring some you are greatly encouraged to do so.

You may want to bring your own sign, water, an umbrella or poncho, and comfortable shoes. 

There are lots of great threads on how to prepare on /r/restorethefourth so make sure you check that out too.

Any questions or suggestions post here, and we'll do our best to help.

See you guys tomorrow!

3rd EDIT:

I will be heading down a little earlier today, so you're all welcome to join me sooner than later if you like.

I know this is a complete stab in the dark, but I figured I'd give it a shot. My mother was in a wreck Saturday night around 7:15 pm in Greensburg at the intersection of Route 30 and 66. Unfortunately, there are no cameras in the area to back her claim up that the light was green, and the lady is claiming that her light was green as well. She was hurt in the accident, and if she cannot prove that she was in the right of way, will have almost no way of covering her hospital bills.

1343695395.0	xf7bd	Pittsburgh seems to have a problem and I think it needs to be stated: Please, slow down and pull over for emergency vehicles, no matter which side of the road that you are on.		114	24	114	"I've been delivering Pizza's in the south hills area for more than 2 years. It's not common for me to pass an emergency vehicle while delivering but every time it happens, the drivers around me only slow down and pull over if the emergency vehicle is headed in their exact direction. However, there were three incidents in particular that warrant more than a ""whoops!"" All of these occurred while I was delivering.

Incident 1: tl;dr ""I'm in a hurry! I'll go first, thank you...""

While approaching an intersection with an island isolated right turn lane with a yield sign, an Ambulance was approaching from the left in the lane we would merge in to. I had moved off to the right at the intersection to ensure that I was not in the way of the ambulance. As I do this, the truck behind me disagrees, pulls around me and speeds off in front of the ambulance. 

Incident 2: tl;dr playing chicken with an ambulance.

I was driving on a two lane, back road with a speed limit of 35. I noticed a large white truck approaching me from the rear at a higher speed than I, so I sped up to 45 so I wasn't ""going slow"" for someone in a hurry. This wasn't good enough and he proceeded to tailgate me. I maintained at 40-45 and notice an ambulance approaching us now. I wait for the truck to pull off so I can then pull off so there isn't an accident in front of the ambulance. Except the truck wasn't pulling over. I waited and waited and he wasn't going to do the responsible thing, and as I saw the ambulance approaching within 3 car lengths of the truck, I pull off to which the truck uses as an opportunity to pass me *and then* pull off for the ambulance. 

Incident 3: tl;dr He's not turning *my* direction

I made a left turn onto a 4 lane road with a speed limit of 35, quickly moving into the right lane to make a quick right turn into an apartment complex. There was a car in either lane behind me, but when I made the left turn, they were some 100-150 yards back. As I approached the right turn, there is an ambulance coming the opposite direction in the left lane. Seeing as though we are approaching a small intersection, I pull off just before the entrance to which the car behind me ignores and flies right on by, just as the ambulance is making it's left turn into the complex. The ambulance was forced to hit his brakes to give way to the car that didn't care. This is the worst in my opinion as it is exemplary of a very short sighted selfishness; would you want the ambulance that you called to save you or a loved one's life held up by someone who is just in too much of a hurry to get out of the way?

This is unacceptable. I imagine one can get a ticket for not pulling off for emergency vehicles, but it's not something you ever see happen. But that doesn't mean that your time is more important than a life that needs to be saved. I read in the paper not a year ago of a man that died because someone was in too much of a hurry to yield to emergency vehicles and collided with the ambulance that was carrying him.

I witness all sorts of careless, reckless and unobservant driving behaviors, like I would anywhere, but this takes the cake. No where else that I have lived or driven in is it even a question of whether or not to pull off for emergency vehicles. Please, Pittsburgh, this needs to stop.

He said that I 'had no idea' how busy they were last night, so I should be willing to give them some leeway; that he knew the lettuce was dirty sometimes because this was the second complaint he'd had about it recently (and so he refunded the price of my salad). He said that he'd also previously had complaints about his staff giving bad phone service, which is why he tries to man the phone when he's working, but he'd been out on deliveries for much of the evening. He offered me free food. I declined, obviously.  I appreciated him getting in touch with me, but I'm still not going back. I appreciate the refund, as well, and I retract the statement that they're all assholes: The owner is not an asshole.	t5_2qhrn	True

As someone who comes from a food service background, I am very hesitant to post a poor review of any restaurant or bar. However, my experience with Finnigan's Wake has forced my hand.

My group requested ahead of time and received one inclusive tab for both food and drinks. After receiving an unitemized tab which we split among our group members, I visited with our server/bartender to make sure everyone had paid and tipped appropriately. I was assured everything was fine.

Upon reviewing my credit card statement several days later, I noticed I had an fraudulent charge from Finnigan's Wake equivalent to the initial amount for which I had signed. I contacted management two times over the course of the next week to inquire about the fraudulent charge, and both times I was told the situation would be looked into and I would be contacted the same day. When I contacted them a third time after not hearing back, I was informed our bartender had mistakenly undercharged my group and because I had made the reservation, I was charged for their mistake.

I am sympathetic to the fact that mistakes occur. But as a former bar manager myself, it is inconceivable to me that Finnegan's Wake management would put an additional charge on my credit card after I already paid my tab and left the bar because they decided they had not charged me enough while I was there.

This not only is a bad business practice, but also is illegal. Fortunately, I disputed the charge with my credit card company and they removed it from my account. With hundreds of bars at your disposal in the Pittsburgh area, why take the chance this will happen to you?"	t5_2qhrn	True
1341155734.0	vvpq3	Neighbors, I would like to share some thoughts with you.	FredRogersAdvice	117	38	17	"Yesterday, a man [made a joke about Pittsburgh](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/vv33b/the_best_thing_i_saw_in_pittsburgh_fixed/) and said negative things about our neighborhood and the people who live here. I know that this was hurtful to many of you, and when we feel hurt, we sometimes like to hit back. Everybody feels that way sometimes. But if there's anything that bothers me, it's one person demeaning another, and two wrongs don't make a right.

Whether we're a preschooler or a young teen, a graduating college senior or a retired person, we human beings all want to know that we're acceptable, that our being alive somehow makes a difference in the lives of others. Feeling good about ourselves is essential in our being able to love others. And sometimes, other people can make us feel less good about ourselves.

But neighbors, you know that hurtful words don't change who we are or devalue us. We don't need to respond in anger to the negative words of a stranger. Without knowing a stranger's whole story, we can't understand why they feel the way they do or why they act the way they do. Instead of responding in anger, it's good to be able to stop and try to understand your neighbor's viewpoint.

It's very dramatic when two people come together to work something out. It's easy to take a gun and annihilate your opposition, but what is really exciting to me is to see people with differing views come together and finally respect each other.

Did you know that the man who made hurtful comments about Pittsburgh [doesn't have power at his house](http://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/vtro1/so_how_many_of_you_had_your_power_knocked_out_by/c57xrm3?context=3) right now? He probably feels angry and a little bit scared. Also, one reason he has negative feelings about Pittsburgh is that he [commuted for a very long time every day](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/vv33b/the_best_thing_i_saw_in_pittsburgh_fixed/c57xw8w), all the way from West Virginia, and probably struggled with the traffic on the Parkway West. We can all agree that five years of that traffic could make anyone feel a bit sour!

Neighbors, there are three ways to ultimate success: The first way is to be kind. The second way is to be kind. And the third way is to be kind. You showed a lot of people how proud we are of our neighborhood, but there wasn't much kindness. Let's try to be better, kinder neighbors to our Reddit friends, even if they say hurtful things sometimes."	t5_2qhrn	True

1341423037.0	w1ey0	Trying to open an arcade in the city of Pittsburgh - Here's an update on things.	MagicPantsMachine	91	10	79	"Hi everyone,

A while back I had posted about how my fiancée and I were trying to open an arcade in Pittsburgh. I wanted to give a little update to everyone to let people know where we stand and what is going on.

We have the equipment. Actually we just drove eight or so hours for a Point Blank machine. Getting all of the rigs working is very hard work. I can't tell you how many crimp connectors we've gone through. But at last we have some games that I think everyone will enjoy.

Unfortunately, I think we've hit a wall. There are some very devastating laws in effect within the city that govern arcades. I don't understand how anyone thinks they would be good for business, but essentially, they make opening an arcade as one would have in the 80's or 90's impossible.


&gt;§ 777.05 - LICENSE FEES.

&gt;(a) The annual fee for the issuance of a license to maintain a mechanical or electronic amusement device that is
&gt;not a ride or a juke box or an electro mechanical gambling device shall be two hundred nine dollars ($209.00).
&gt;
&gt;(f) The quarterly license fee for amusement arcades containing six (6) or more licensed mechanical or electronic
&gt;amusement devices shall be seven hundred forty-six dollars ($746.00). This fee shall be due on or before
&gt;January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 of the current year.


The $746 quarterly ($2984 annually) is pretty bad. There is no feasible way for us to take 15 or 20 arcade cabinets (to start) that make 25 cents a play and make a profit on this. We were actually going to be taking a loss on things before, and would've been okay with it, but that will put a huge dent in what our reserves are anyway.

The thing that absolutely crushes us though is the license fee per machine. It appears that in addition to the $746 quarterly fee and the mercantile license needed to maintain a place like that, you **also** have to pay a fee on each machine, which in the books, is $209 a pop. So, if we have 20 cabinets, that means we have to pay $4180 a year in taxes just for this law.

Worst part? The feest just went up. It's now $800 quarterly ($3,200 annually) for the license, and $305 per each machine ($6,100 total on 20 machines) . So look at it this way:

If we have 40 people enter the shop every day and they each play 8 games (which is actually being a bit pragmatic, I think.) That would be 80 dollars. Assuming we can do this for 116 days straight, only then will we pay off the licenses. Never mind the rent, electricity, or the maintenance on the machines.

Even that has a lot of variables. In a shop with 20 arcade machines, chances are, not every one of them will get played evenly. Some will probably not be touched except once or twice a day. It's a huge loss for someone to have, say, an old Galaga machine that gets 4 or so plays every day. Then, even if it's played every day for those four times, it will never makes the funds necessary to be worth it. This is sad, because a lot of the old, unpopular machines are my favorites.

We are going to go talk to a lawyer in a bit to see what we can do about this. Unfortunately, I think that there may be nothing we can do about the fee on the actual ""amusement place"" itself. However, there is something weird about the way the city defines an arcade machine itself:


&gt;§ 777.01 - LICENSE REQUIRED; EXCEPTION.
&gt;
&gt;(a) No proprietor shall set up, allow to be set-up, establish or cause to be set up or established, exhibit, display
&gt;or maintain on the premises of a business establishment within the city, for the purpose of gaining advantage or
&gt;profit, any mechanical or electronic device, machine or apparatus of any kind for the playing of games or
&gt;otherwise used for the purpose of amusement or entertainment by the insertion therein of any currency or a coin
&gt;or any other metal disc, slug or token, without first obtaining a license from the License Officer. A license fee
&gt;shall be paid for each machine. This provision shall be applicable to proprietors who charge fees for the use of
&gt;pool tables on their premises although such pool tables do not operate through the insertion of currency, coin,
&gt;metal disc, slug or token.
&gt;
&gt;(b) This Chapter is not applicable to devices, machines or apparatus where the cost, price or consideration for
&gt;playing one (1) game is less than five cents ($0.05).


So this is interesting. I think what it's saying is that all of these laws and regulations are only applicable if the cabinet itself takes money, or if the amount of money it takes is over a nickel. So what if the machines were all set to free-play, and all you have to do is say, pay something at the door? I'm not sure if I'm reading it right, but maybe someone else can let me know if that's what they think it says. If we did have people pay something at the door, then we may have to pay the Allegheny County Amusement Tax, but I think we're okay there. It's just that massive fee on each cabinet.

The funny thing is that I don't think any places over the county line have these weird laws.

Anyway, that's everything for now. We're still going to continue gathering games. I think that even if this doesn't work out, we'll still have a nifty big arcade in our house, and that can't be too bad, right? Except for the fact that I'm horrible at Street Fighter, and that seems to be all he wants to play :P"	t5_2qhrn	True

Back for a third week since everyone seems to really enjoy these posts.
People have pointed out that you can go to the City Paper, Jambase, last.fm, or a handful of other websites to get all of these show listings. I use all of those along with venue pages, blogs, and social media to round up everything. No list is perfect, this one isn't either, I'm just trying to bring together a what's happening in Pittsburgh music for the week post.

I'm going to miss shows here and there, so if the community could help out and post shows in the comments too that would be great! If you're in a band, post your shows here too! Include a link to your music so that people can hear your songs.

I'm going to make these posts on Mondays and list shows all the way through Sunday. I'd also like to include recently announced shows so that people can plan ahead.

Feel free to discuss the past week in music. For example, shows you went to last week, which new records you're listening to, etc...

* Date:        April 3, 2012


Very early this morning, the University received a bomb threat targeting the
Litchfield Towers, and by mid-morning, another bomb threat targeting the Chevron
Science Center was made.  These were the third and fourth bomb threats targeting
Pitt buildings to be received in less than twenty-four hours and the tenth and
eleventh to be received in recent weeks.  Each of these threats has been disruptive
– requiring the evacuation of facilities, interfering with classes, interrupting
other important work and, in the case of the Litchfield Towers threat, causing
students to leave their residence hall rooms in the middle of the night.

Each threat has been taken seriously, with safety standing as our highest priority.
Careful searches of each evacuated building, using trained canine units from within
the University and from other area police departments, have detected no evidence of
any explosives of any kind at any site.  We are thankful for that result and are
deeply grateful for the help we have received, both in clearing buildings and in
pressing forward with the ongoing investigation, from many other law enforcement
agencies.  In fact, it should be underscored that those efforts represent one of the
many significant costs resulting from these threats – that limited police resources
have been reallocated from other pressing matters to be invested in the security of
this campus.

The inability to bring this succession of threats to a quick end obviously is a
source of frustration for everyone whose life has been disrupted by them.  But I can
assure you that law enforcement professionals are doing everything they can to
pursue all possible leads.  And, as most of you already know, in addition to the
police work and related efforts being undertaken within the University itself, we
have offered a very substantial reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of those responsible for these crimes.

Even without the motivation that might be provided by a reward, I ask all members of
the University community to be especially attentive to any unusual activity and to
share any relevant information with the University of Pittsburgh Police. 
Representatives of the Department can be reached by phone at (412) 624-2121 or by
email at police@pitt.edu
. 

Particularly given last month’s shootings at the Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic and recent reminders of violence on other campuses, those responsible for
these threats not only lack basic respect for the thousands of people whose lives
have been disrupted by them but must possess a heartless streak.  When those
responsible are apprehended, we will work to ensure that they are prosecuted to the
full extent of the law.  Until then, driven by a different set of values, we will
maintain safety as our priority and do our best to cope with whatever further
disruptions may come our way."	t5_2qhrn	True

The delivery guy, arriving an hour later, brought me spaghetti, potatoes covered in mozarella and onions, and garlic bread.  I didn't do more than flip it open, flip it closed, and call him back; despite his only having driven thirty seconds away by the time I had him on the phone, it took twenty minutes for him to return to swap it out for my actual meal.

My meal was clammy, the buffalo wings were lizard-legs dusted in powdered _bland,_ the vegetables were deep-fried and still frozen in the middle, and the salad? Had mud in it. Chunks of mud. Pebbles of dirt.  Which I didn't realize until I had a crunchy mouthful.

Called back to talk to the shop about it and was immediately put on hold. Hung there ten minutes before giving up.  Fuck those guys. Sideways. With rusty, tarantula-covered gardening tools.

Due to requests the event will be 18+ YOU WILL NEED ID IF YOU PLAN ON CONSUMING ALCOHOL- I have decided on using wristbands to identify everyone 21 and over, anyone caught drinking underage will be asked to leave immediately.

My next concern will be cost, those pavilions are NOT cheap, and i would like to provide alcohol and food and such (BYOB is allowed of course as long as you are legal). Who would be willing to donate (via verified paypal) to help cover the cost of the event? PM me if you would like to, the more donations the more goodies i can provide.

I'm going to miss shows here and there, so if the community could help out and post shows in the comments too that would be great! If you're in a band, post your shows here too! Include a link to your music so that people can hear your songs.

I'm going to make these posts on Mondays and list shows all the way through Sunday. I'd also like to include recently announced shows so that people can plan ahead.

**UPDATE** Added report linked at the bottom; includes a phone number to call with information.

**UPDATE 2** [This picture](http://imgur.com/lnKEo)

**UPDATE 3** [This article](http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2011/12/09/bridgeville-man-disappears-after-concert/)

His name is Jim Slack and he's from the Bridgeville area.

He was last seen on the North Shore around Stage AE at 3 AM on December 7th, so its been over 48 hours. No one has heard from him. 

[Here is a picture of him lifted from Facebook.](http://imgur.com/89W5r) He'd be about 25 or 26.

If you see him, please take the appropriate action. According to Facebook posts, a New Kensington phone called the Slack residence last night but there was only dead air for three minutes. That could be meaningful or not.

I haven't seen this kid in years, and we were only ever acquaintences, but I wanted to do something.

1352011963.0	12lqjy	A friendly reminder... keep Pittsburgh safe, don't drink and drive	gnychis	85	16	28	"I entered 376 going eastbound going from Monroeville--&gt;Oakland.  As soon as I merge, I notice a truck already on 376 going well under the speed limit (~40mph), swerving on and off of the shoulder, and in to the other lane of traffic.  It's only the truck and I at this point.  I slow down a bit to watch him in my rear view mirror and confirm he's drunk, and then call it in.  Maybe others feel differently, but if I see someone dangerously swerving and clearly drunk, I'm calling it in.  So I pick up my phone and start to dial 911, as I'm doing so I see a car coming from in the distance behind the truck.  At this point the truck puts his turn signal on and is still swerving.  The car attempts to pass the truck, at which point the truck swerves and slams in to the car. All I see after that behind me is smoke and the truck in the hillside. 

I don't know what happened to either, but my 911 call ended up being a report of a DUI related accident rather than helping to stop someone driving drunk from causing an accident.  I don't know if calling in a drunk driver actually does anything, but I'd rather know that I at least tried to prevent it.  Maybe someone in law enforcement could chime in here.

But, I think the reminder never hurts... please don't drink and drive!"	t5_2qhrn	True

My friend was riding his bike when people in a **grey sedan** ~~accused him of cutting them off~~ began following him. He was attacked while carrying his bike up steps on the South Side slopes. His throat was slashed, but he is alive.

[News article here](http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/mans-throat-slashed-south-side-attack/nR4cx/).

Did you see a car speeding down Josephine late last night, or maybe you were harassed by the same people in South Side earlier that night?

My guess is someone's bag got jacked and emptied on my deck? Maybe you were thrown out and as you fled you lost a bunch? I have no idea.

I don't know why your stuff is here, but if you want it, let me know. If it's ""evidence"" in a crime, I have pictures of it in its natural state (next to our overturned Oregano :( )

Now before you start telling me about having a jitney driver, or planning ahead for a more complicated plan involving a willing friend to drive me around in the middle of the night, tell me if there's a number that I can call and get a taxi within 30 minutes. You can do this easily in NYC, Philly, Rome, Paris, Warsaw, Minneapolis and even Cincinnati. Why the hell is this such a pain in the ass in the ""Most livable city""?

She was crying, and seemed really sincere at the time. I gave her 20 bucks and she asked me for my phone number and drove away. She said she would call me and pay me back tomorrow morning and how thankful she was. So, I googled her phone number (because she called me after she had my number so I would have hers... dumb idea on her part), and it turns out that there is literally a website with 100 of the same accounts from the same lady, claiming to be a woman named ""Andrea"". I was enraged. I can clearly see why she pulled up and asked me- I'm a 24 year old girl that smiles at everyone. I was an easy target. I'm also a poor grad student that doesn't have 20 dollars to waste on someone that is a total liar. 

I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else in the area, and what they have done about it. Should I call the police to report it? Really not sure the next step to take, or if anyone has heard of this insane lady before.

A few weeks ago I posted a link to my story, Steel City: Part One. I received an enormous amount of support from all of you here and I wanted to go ahead and say thank you to each and every one of you who purchased a copy.

However, this weekend is my Mother's birthday, and I figured it was a good as time as any to do a promotion for the book. Today and tomorrow, the Kindle version of the book will be FREE to everyone. You can download the Kindle app free for your cell phone, tablet, or PC if you don't already have a Kindle, and then download the book free of charge. 

I know some of you said before that money was tight, so I hope you now have a chance to get it this weekend and enjoy it. I'd also ask that everyone who downloads the story give it a review. It helps me out and I appreciate any and all feedback.

Here's the link to [Steel City: Part One](http://www.amazon.com/Steel-City-Part-One-ebook/dp/B00ALE979U/ref=la_B00ALX37R4_1_1_title_1_kin?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358027274&amp;sr=1-1)

I believe that it is important for Congress to examine and address the presence of illegal, pirated content on the Internet.  It is critical for our nation to make sure that our artists and musicians are properly compensated for the cultural product they share with the world.  However, like you. I also believe that the Stop Online Piracy Act, introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), does not properly target online piracy and could have serious consequences for existing and new websites and technologies on the Internet.



What concerns me most about this legislation is that it would target the Internet's domain name system, permitting the Department of Justice to request that Internet service providers block user access to websites that carry pirated content.  The bill would also allow individual rightsholders to litigate websites or search engines that carry unlawful material, potentially causing a massive increase in copyright-related lawsuits.  I am worried that H.R. 3261 would even permit such tactics to be use against sites where legal content is also present, thereby punishing even those outlets that didn't commit a crime.



I am also concerned that websites which carry user-generated content might be wrongfully punished.  The owners of these sites are often unaware of the kinds of content that individual users upload to them.  Yet under this legislation, they could be sued or blocked just like any other website would be.



Importantly, there is existing law already on the books by the name of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which requires websites to take down any content if they receive an intellectual property-related complaint.  This law has worked well to prompt search engines and websites to remove unlawful content from the Internet.  While pirated content does continue to be present on the web, I believe it is important to continue to protect innovation and the basic framework of the Internet, and therefore to develop a more targeted approach against piracy than the Stop Online Piracy Act provides.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to create targeted solutions to deter the availability of such content.



As you might know, the Senate is considering similar legislation, entitled S. 968, the Protect IP Act.  That legislation was introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  As Congress continues to deliberate the topic of online piracy, please be assured that I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect against Internet piracy in a balanced and targeted manner.



Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again if I can be of assistance to you in the future.




Sincerely,

Mike Doyle

Edit 1: Word is that there was an arguement about the 2nd ammendment on an X page.

Edit 2: Apparently there was some chirping between Benz and another unknown person in the press box. However, this doesn't seem to be checking out.

Final edit: So here's pretty much the story. A local gun shop owner decided to give away an AR-15 in a contest as a protest against the Obama Assault Weapon Ban that is in congress at the moment. The Pittsburgh Tactical Firearms Facebook Page decided to promote the raffle and the fact that this guy is giving away tons of free assault weapon stuff along with it. TB responded by bashing the give away saying that it was stupid. Queue the response from the facebook page to go after Benz and everyone else in the thread on the X Site.

Tim then blew a gasket and began to threaten the members and vice versa. The posts were all then deleted and Tim Benz quit.

I'm nervous but hopeful the quality of the book will speak for itself. 

It's available in both Kindle and Paperback format. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the jist of the book is that there's been a pandemic that wiped out a lot of society but the city of Pittsburgh has stood as a beacon of hope in the northeast for a decade since the outbreak, and it gets intense from there. 

I am very proud of this, and really hope you all like it (and maybe give me a review and/or tell people you know about it).

For those that do not know, this particular section of turnpike has two tunnels, the previous shortest and longest of the entire highway. But here's the issue, I read on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandoned_Pennsylvania_Turnpike) that it is owned by the SAC (Southern Alleghenies Conservancy,) who allows biking on the section owned by them. Though, [this site](http://www.abandonedturnpike.com/) seems unsure of the current ownership. I simply want to make sure it would still be **legal** as I would not like a fine.

After working alongside Pittsburghers for Public Transit (PPT) in the past few months, the reality of bus routes being cut has begun to sink in. If the new plans for reduction parallel anything that was proposed last september, ALMOST HALF of all bus routes will be cut, and ANOTHER 1/3 will be reduced service!

Public transportation is a vital aspect of our Pittsburgh infrastructure. Thousands of people rely on their bus routes to get to work, school, doctors appointments, etc.

1372265362.0	1h48wy	Beware of a human-computer interaction flaw in the new parking payment stations	blankey2	55	10	37	"So, overall I like the new parking system popping up all over Pittsburgh, where you enter your license plate into the machine, then enter payment, and then it asks you if you want a receipt or not, and then you're done. I think it lets more people park on a street at one time and I don't have to worry about having quarters on me, which is always a nuisance.

However, I recommend that when the screen comes up that says, ""Receipt is optional, do you want one?"" you say YES. Here is why. Now, I'm doing this from memory, so I may not have every detail exact, but the general tenor is correct.

I was standing behind a woman waiting to input my car details and pay for my parking. She finished up and left the kiosk right after the screen says ""You're done, press green button for optional receipt."" So, there I am staring at it, not knowing what to do. The woman is long gone and the screen is still there. It seems like nothing is happening. Is it ready for me to input my license? I have to get back to that screen.

So, I did what most people would do--I press the ""cancel"" button so that I move along with my transaction.

To my surprise and chagrin it did not cancel me only out of the CURRENT screen, but it canceled the woman's entire transaction. In other words, her car was no longer registered for parking, and if a meter guy/woman came along, input the license plate, it wouldn't have shown up in the database has having been paid. (And I assume her credit card was not charged.) Basically I unintentionally dicked her over. 

The solution to this is always request the optional receipt. Once it prints out, the machine resets and is ready for the next person. If you just say to yourself ""oh, I don't need a receipt and anyway it says it's optional,"" and you leave, the guy behind you might be waiting--I dunno, 30 seconds? a minute?--staring at that screen. Most people are impatient and will press the ""cancel"" button, I presume. When they do this, your entire transaction is canceled and you might get a ticket. But printing the receipt will always circumvent this issue.

I was going to take a video of the process by which this can happen, but--does anyone care that much :-)"	t5_2qhrn	True

* One person yelling at me to get off the road.
* Three people passing me so close I could touch their cars.
* Having to slam on my brakes to not hit a person making a ""Pittsburgh Left"" in front of me.
* Four people driving cars in a bike lane.
* One person tailgating me closer than a car length because I was only traveling 27 mph on a 25 mph road and there wasn't room for the person to pass me.

And while I don't normally see as many of these things on a single ride, not a one of them is remotely unusual.

This is why I find it very difficult to find sympathy with all of the people complaining about cyclists on the road.  There are lots of automobile drivers out there who are actively endangering my life on a daily basis.  This is what I mean by the statement that automobile drivers are often worse than the cyclists on the road.

While I pedantically try to follow state law on my daily commute I can certainly sympathize with the cyclists who don't follow the letter of the law so that they can avoid interactions with automobiles (though I have few sympathies for the people who ignore the rules altogether)."	t5_2qhrn	True

1368049260.0	1dyj5u	Anyone hiring for anything? My boss is abusive, and I'm tired of crying in the bathroom at work.	ineedajobpgh	64	18	50	"I need a new job desperately. My current boss is cruel and yells - literally *yells* at employees on a daily basis - and accuses me of ""being retarded"". She yells at me if I wear a skirt, she yells at me if I don't wear a skirt, she yells at me if I make a mistake, she yells at me if I don't make a mistake, she yells at me if I call clients to get repeat sales, she yells at me if I don't call clients to get repeat sales... she yells at me constantly, for anything, whether or not I messed up. I think screaming at me is like therapy for her own job frustrations, but it's making my own stress skyrocket. 

I'm so sick of holding back tears in the workplace, and I desperately want to quit, but I can't afford to until I find a new job. I've been on job searching sites and pouring through the classifieds for months now, to no avail. I figured I'd try here. If any of you are hiring, know someone who is hiring, or can help in any way, please let me know.

I graduated college a year ago; I have a bachelor's in English (professional writing) and a minor in Marketing. For the past year, I've been working as marketing manager.

I'm a very, very fast learner. If you have an obscure job you need someone to learn a special set of skills for, I'd be the person to call. 

**Things I can do really well:** 

* write ad copy 
* write PR releases 
* write memos 
* write anything you need me to, really
* revise and edit for correct grammar, conciseness, and style
* do anything administrative
* do SEO optimization
* help on marketing campaigns
* file files
* make copies
* do anything on Microsoft Office, Adobe InDesign, or QuarkXPress
* read at 600wpm
* type 70wpm
* teach/tutor English literature or English writing skills

**Things I cannot do very well:**

* Lift, carry, or transport over 25lbs
* Stand for very long periods of time
* Sing

I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs, and any criminal background check will come up clean. Please, does anyone out there have a job for me?

Also, if you live in Bloomfield, make sure you keep your house locked up while you're at work, because this happened at 2:30-3:30 pm.

I guess they hadn't really spoken to anyone from Reddit, beyond one person asking ""hey are you guys from Reddit?"" (They're not, by the way.)

Now, these guys seemed completely sincere, and genuinely interested in why the rest of the world cared about their ""Baje face"" icon. I told them all about Reddit, their immediate Pittsburgh internet fame, and the amount of buzz generated simply by the icon on their door and wall. They were pretty surprised, to say the least.

The troll face, to them, is a ""Baje"" face. (Which is the top item on their menu. **[See picture](http://i.imgur.com/mj81R.jpg)**.) The most they knew about the ""internet version"" was that it's used when ""someone's being a jerk."" =P

They insisted that the troll face was the icon for ""Baje"", or something. Sure enough, **[googling ""Baje face""](http://www.google.com/images?q=baje+face&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=796)** does, indeed, return the troll face.

The restaurant, itself, wasn't anything magnificent, as posted before. No chairs or tables - just a register and a glass display case full of food. It's new, though, so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. I didn't try any food (had just eaten).

I ended up writing down Reddit and /r/pittsburgh's URL for them, so they may, in fact, see this post. =) I'm all for making this a regular meetup location (preferably if they get some tables, but hey).

Called Indian Trail, probably following an existing trail, they started near the Duquesne Incline, went westward, and after a switchback in a steep section, they reached Duquesne Heights at the intersection of Grandview Avenue and Shaler St.

There are still many posts that can be found today on the trail.  They are in pretty bad shape.  I just made my first trek down from the ""trail"" yesterday evening.  There isn't much of a trail past the first few hundred feet.  It is rugged and treacherous terrain.  I recommend any avid or extreme hikers to try it out!  Follow the orange markers (there arent many of them).

1354216361.0	140ae7	Zagat has released it's list of top resturants in Pittsburgh. For shame, Zagat. For shame. 	pittsburghbiscuit	48	7	48	"According the the reputable people at Zagat, the best restaurants in Pittsburgh are:
1) Capital Grille
2) Ruth's Chris
3)Morton's
4) McCormick and Schmick's
5) P.F. Chang's
6) Cheesecake Factory

Apparently Pittsburgh has restaurant options that are just slightly better than most outlet malls. 




EDIT:   I learned that they have to include all ""chains"" in their guide, and unlike online reviews, service plays a huge part in the with Zagats rating. Thus the Capital Grill being in there regardless of who may have better steak - although I don't know who that would be.  Anyway, this isn't the final ranking so it's curious that it was released in the Business Times. "	t5_2qhrn	True

Quick service aside, the ""'Second Best Selling' Pitts-Burger"" (a steak burger between two slices of Italian bread, with tomatoes, cole slaw, french fries, and provolone) disappointed in every metric.  It was terrible.

As someone who eats at Subway twice a week (it's next door to work, and cheap protein when chicken subs are on sale), I can still honestly say that Primanti Bros. put out the blandest, most flavorless sandwich I'd ever eaten.

1352709397.0	13206v	Thanks for a great weekend....	Yourswolefriend	54	12	23	"Hey /r/pittsburgh!  

A buddy and I came to the city on a whim from SE Ohio and spent Saturday.  It was only my second time in Pittsburgh, and it was a treat.  Hit the Science Center then walked and viewed the city en route to Primanti Bros in the Strip District.  Then we took the river path back and hung out in various local bars and hit some shops (and got a new Terrible Towel! yay!).  

But what I came to say is this:  Thank you for being filled with genuinely wonderful people.  Everyone (with exception of some dude yelling at hipsters) was very kind and reflected the vibe I expected from the city as hard-working but relaxed.  The architecture is awesome, from the bridges to the buildings of all eras.  We have nothing like it back my way.  The food was fantastic, but no surprise there.  I genuinely had one of the best days of my life in Pitt.  The only hard part was leaving...literally.  Got lost for an hour trying to head south on 279 from N Shore Dr and ended up south of the Liberty Tunnel on bower Hill Rd trying to find the interstate at midnight.  lol

I've toyed with the idea of moving there (Steelers and Pens fan) for years after my ex's dad talked it up and got me into the Steelers 7 years back).  But after today, its a foregone conclusion.  I want to live there and take in all the culture and excitement of Pittsburgh.  Thanks for making my time so awesome, and next time, I'll try to hit up some of you and go out for some beers.

I think the attic was being converted into a pyramidal orgone accumulator, but that may just be an artifact of the previous roof's shape.

I'm looking for an architect, or an interior designer, or, heck, even an installation artist to come by and make a few guesses as to what some of the rooms were trying to become, and maybe bring some ideas of their own to it.

Major League Bocce - Pittsburgh, a division of Major League Bocce, the nation's largest bocce league, has officially arrived in Pittsburgh for its inaugural season for Spring 2013!! If you like playing with balls, drinking, or a combination of both then check us out!



The inaugural Spring season officially opens in Pittsburgh on April 30th and will conclude on June 18th. All of the games will be played on **Tuesdays at 6:30pm** at **the Point** in downtown with a trip to our local sponsor bar (TBD) to follow.



You can [sign up](http://play.majorleaguebocce.com/sites/Pittsburgh/register.aspx) in one of 3 ways: 

* Create a team (and invite your friends to join)
* Join an existing team (team name and password required)
* Register solo (We'll place you on a team at the close of registration) 


*NOTE: when creating a new team, all captains now have the ability to choose their team's shirt color!* 



Additional Details:

* All players must be 21 years of age or older
* All players must be properly registered through Major League Bocce
* All players must pay the $45 registration fee
* All players must have adequate health insurance
* All Players must sign the Release Form/Waiver


If any of you want to play register today or have any questions, ask away! 

Check out our [website](http://play.majorleaguebocce.com/sites/Pittsburgh) and [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/MLBoccePittsburgh) for more information!

EDIT: formatted to make it more readable as this was originally posted from a phone.

EDIT 2: I know some of you had questions regarding what qualifies as ""adequate"" health insurance. I did some more research and follow up with our corporate office regarding what qualifies as ""adequate"" health insurance for players. Even if a player does not have insurance, they still CAN sign up and play, but they must keep in mind that in the registration process they will be checking a box stating they do have it. This is a legally binding agreement so if they (by some minuscule chance) get injured, Major League Bocce will not be liable in any way. So if your friends would want to join, they are more than welcome to and we would be happy to have them! They just need to understand that by checking that box, they are agreeing to waive Major League Bocce of any legal liability in the very minimal chance of injury. Cheers!"	t5_2qhrn	True

People have pointed out that you can go to the City Paper, Jambase, last.fm, or a handful of other websites to get all of these show listings. I use all of those along with venue pages, blogs, and social media to round up everything. No list is perfect, this one isn't either, I'm just trying to bring together a what's happening in Pittsburgh music for the week post.

I'm going to miss shows here and there, so if the community could help out and post shows in the comments too that would be great! If you're in a band, post your shows here too! Include a link to your music so that people can hear your songs.

I'm going to make these posts on Mondays and list shows all the way through Sunday. I'd also like to include recently announced shows so that people can plan ahead.

Feel free to discuss the past week in music. For example, shows you went to last week, which new records you're listening to, etc...

I don't understand why we can't put a bunch of people to work, and make Pittsburgh the next super-modern city of the 21st century.

The multi-million dollar tunnel project is almost completed. What's keeping us from tearing out the HOV lane on parkway north and running a T line clear up to Cranberry Twp? I understand that money is always an issue, but sometimes you just have to do what makes sense.
