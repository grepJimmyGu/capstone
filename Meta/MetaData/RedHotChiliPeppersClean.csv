To refresh your memory, [here's what happened last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedHotChiliPeppers/comments/ol9do/rhcp_made_me_the_happiest_girl_alive/).

After that it was obvious that I'd do anything to see them again. And I did. On the 30th of June at Stade de France, I was waiting in line and who do I see? That same photographer walking around. I went to talk to him and he recognized me. We started talking and I thanked me for what he did last October (Since I never got the chance since).I freaked the fuck out.

Fast forward to last week.I met RHCP, had dinner with them, spent the next day with them, went backstage, had a drum lesson with Chad Smith, and watched the show from the stage. Basically, I lived the happiest moments of my entire existence. These memories are so sacred to me, that I wanted to keep them for myself. The band didn't want to make a fuss out of it, that's why I chose Reddit, to stay anonymous. I am doing this to tell the world what wonderful, honorable, and respectful human beings they are, and spread the love for the Peppers. AMA. 

Edit: Straight to the point.

1374162700.0	1ikcvf	Guide to John Frusciante's Solo Work	i_am_not_jesus_	70	8	29	"To all the people who are just recently discovering Frusciante's music and are wondering where to start, here is a breakdown of each of his albums.

**Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-shirt**

The first solo album released in 1994 after he left the Red Hot Chili Peppers is described as being Avante Garde with a stream of consciousness style.  Originally meant to be two albums, the first half was written and recorded when John was clean and the second half when he started using drugs.  Though this album is a little difficult to get into it is regarded as a masterpiece among many Frusciante Fans.

Sample Songs:  [Your Pussy's Glued to a Building on Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR53pfkWXro),  [Mascara](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD_1LUL3yH8),  [Untitled #3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThWWcokyVjU)

**Smile from the Streets You Hold**

I would not recommend  listening to this album until you are absolutely ready.  Frusciante was very deep into his drug addiction at this point in his career and the music represents this very much.  The album was released in 1997 for drug money and features River Phoenix on 2 songs.  This is in my opinion the most upsetting and strange album but is still amazing.  Listen only when you are ready.

Sample Songs:  [Life's a Bath **Explicit Video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg0HmQjggAE],  [Poppy Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqDr2tia6wY)

**To Record Only Water for Ten Days**

This album was the first album he released after rejoining RHCP and was released in 2001.  It is after his drug addiction and is much more accessible.  It has a synth pop feel to it but with a lot of guitar playing.  Vincent Gallo produced a video for every song on the album.  As said before this album is pretty easily accessible to new listeners.

Sample songs:  [Murderers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTwMln4hQUg),  [Ramparts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62VQpUKg-WA),  [Going Inside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQNksQZlIe4)

**Shadows Collide with People**

I would suggest this album to any new comers.  It has hints of Frusciante's electronic style but is completely rock driven.  It has appearances by Josh Klinghoffer, Chad Smith, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, and Flea.  It is one of his most commercially successful solo albums.

Sample Songs:  [Carvel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC1Ayh_cC1E),  [Time Goes Back](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfSuGWIFOYs),  [Omission](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug4a8kApRpQ)

**The Will to Death**

Another very accessible album that was released shortly after Shadows.  Josh Klinghoffer also makes several apearences on this album.  This album is more of a minimalist arty style, but nothing too out there.

Sample Songs:  [Time Runs Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oELIUoYpcE),  [The Days Have Turned](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur4BNmaDPYs),  [Wishing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZgCHBEAmY8)

**Inside of Emptiness**

The hardcore rock epic released 2004 has a punk feel and is rather intense.  If you like alternative and traditional rock this is definitely the album for you.  John described it as ""a lot of spontaneity and recklessness and not giving a fuck.""  Josh Klinghoffer contributes to this album and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez plays guitar on 666.  

Sample Songs:  [Inside a Break](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYbdVsWRqEQ),  [666](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY4J067vbZY),  [Scratches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR7MUfxns9c)

**Curtains**

This album is very acoustic driven and has a soft rock feel to it. Like almost all of his album, Klinghoffer makes several appearences.  Omar also plays a solo on Anne with John.  Curtains is one of John's most critically acclaimed albums.

Sample Songs:  [Anne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPmDhWBGOJ0),  [The Past Recedes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v9CfE90Sts),  [Ascension](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG01f0e_kls)

**The Empyrean**

This is a favorite among many Frusciante fans and is quite epic.  It is John's ""White Album.""  It is a concept album that is meant to tell a story lyrically and musically.  The first track is an homage to Funkadelic's Maggot Brain and the rest of the tracks are indescribable.  It is very accessible to new listeners and should be listened to to fully understand what it is.

Sample Songs:  [Before the Beginning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKmakQ6zGRs),  [Central](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9jsRZzjrgI),  [Unreachable](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeLdyrXv0FQ)

**Letur-Lefr**

This EP is John's first real album that delves into electronic music and is considered more accessible than the second, PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone.  All instruments are played by John and most singing is done by him other than some by Nicole Turley and some MC's, most notably RZA.  It is definitey a good listen for any fan of John's work.

Sample Songs:  [FM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrAA2h0Oy7g),  [In My Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6veJGKIOIZc)

**PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone**

This is one of John's less liked works and really experiments with electronic music.  John does everything on this album except for violin on Uprane and Kinetic 9 is featured on Ratiug.  This album is not for everyone and judging from what we have heard from Outsides so far it seems like it will be similar for sure.  It cannot be said for sure though so give it a listen when it comes out.

Sample Songs: [Ratiug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiYRcHdayg0),  [Sum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZ-QGPnRDY)


Feel free to add your opinions in the comments and add to anything I may have missed.  Not all of John's EPs were in here but they are all good so listen to them when you get the chance.  Also check out the band Ataxia if you haven't already as well as John and Josh's album *A Sphere in the Heart of Silence*.  And send this guide to anyone who is looking to get into Frusciante's solo music."	t5_2s504	True

&gt; Got so much more

&gt; To offer the world

&gt; See what's in store



""Pleasure to meet you"" can either refer to the point in time where John introduced Josh to the band or when Josh officially became their new guitarist. The rest implies that while he's already talented and off to a great start, he has so much more in store that he can bring out of his mind. More will be revealed, my friend.

&gt; Open the doors

&gt; And we never close shop

Josh reopened the band. John leaving almost stopped them. But even losing one of the greatest guitarists to ever live wasn't enough to stop his student from keeping the band going. 

&gt; When you shine

&gt; Shake it for me anyway



I think it's clear that Josh was a little reserved at first. He went to Frusciante to get his blessing to join the band, but he still held back for a while during the beginning. To me, it seems like he has anxiety issues. Take a look at any interview he's in and you'll see what I mean. Anthony is saying that Josh needs to rock the fuck out with his cock out regardless of how anxious he feels, because it’s a beautiful thing when he shines. And what's more, is that he doesn’t try to perfectly emulate John. He mixes his style with his own, creating something completely different that still smells of Frusciante.

&gt; Do you feel the spark

&gt; When you play the part

&gt; Superstar

&gt; Fake it for me anyway



Do you feel that same spark from the 4th dimension that John felt? I know you'll be a superstar Josh, and if you're still anxious about it, fake it for me anyway. John was at your point around Mother’s Milk. He helped make a solid album (like I’m With You), and then went on to co-create 4 of the greatest albums in the world. The parts are all there, they just need time to get in that chili pepper magic zone.

&gt; If you care at all

&gt; You will bare it all

&gt; You will grind

&gt; Shake it for me anyway



If Josh cared for the band and the music they make, he'd drop whatever mental walls he had set up that were blocking the flow of music. And he did. And it was good. I fucking love Josh, but he was definitely holding back at first. In the first 1/3 or so of their tour, you could barely hear him playing and singing. I don’t blame him at all, if I were in his position, I’d want to smoothly transition into the band too. People needed to get used to Josh, just like how Josh needed to get used to the people. Now he's gained all the confidence that he needed in order to gradually let down his barriers. Now he's at the point where he's improvising on songs, creating his own versions of old solos, and singing loudly like a goddamn champ. I will take you home Josh, we'll all take you home. I remember hearing that part of Did I let you Know back in the later part of 2011. I thought to myself, ""wow, that woman has an amazing voice."" Then it blew my mind when I learned that it was Josh and not a guest singer or something like that.

&gt; Born to play the part

&gt; Dying for your art

There was no other option to replace John besides Josh. He was the clear choice, having been Froosh's prodige for years. And he shares that same love for music, to the point where he'd sacrifice for it. Maybe it refers to him sacrificing his current state of calmness to feel that surge of anxiety that would lead to a greater state of calmness. I'm familiar with that.

&gt; When we fill the void

&gt; That is pink as floyd

John didn't just leave, he left a hole/void the size of one of the biggest/most influential bands of all time.  Only someone like Josh could hope to fill it.

&gt; To destroy

&gt; Records that we file away

&gt; And we'll clean the slate

&gt; As we calculate

&gt; Your fate


It was time for the band as a whole to clear their mind of all things John Anthony Frusciante. He's gone and he's (likely) not coming back. The slate has been wiped clean, and Josh holds the chisel. Anthony sees the greatness in him, and he knows he'll create great things in the years to come.

**Tl;dr** Wall of text. Song's about Josh being the new guitarist and the amazing things he has done and will continue to do. I realize a lot of the lyrics are out of order, but this is how I deconstructed it, so there you go.

1359060270.0	177lej	The story of how John and Josh met, in 1999. And, what beautiful album Josh made that year (better than Dot Hacker). 	catwrightRHCP	53	1	12	"John was leaving a studio where RHCP was recording Californication one day in 1999 when he bumps into a 19 year old Josh Klinghoffer with a guitar. John asks him what he is working on. Josh caught him off gaurd when he said he was making an album with Bob Forrest in their band called The Biciycle Thief.




The Bicycle thief was basically just Bob on vocals and Josh doing all guitar work, then a drummer. Anyway, John was caught off gaurd because he too was in a band called at one point with Bob Forrest. Bob recruited John in 1988 to play guitar for Thelonious Monster after his audition went very well. Except, RHCP heard about John's audition, offered him the job with them, and JF went to the Peppers. Bob Forrest is actually very good friends with all of RHCP.





Back to John and Josh's meeting. John was like, ""whoa. bob forrest. id love to hear what you have."" So they started hanging out. Josh and Bob even had John bust out a solo on one of the songs from what would be The Bicycle Thief's only album. John invited Josh out on the Californication tour. Within 5 years from then, John and Josh put out what, 7 albums together? That was a magical meeting. We've come very far. Almost full circle.





This is the album below. Josh does ALL guitar (except for a solo from John on Cereal Song). Josh drums a bit too, but I cant find out which songs. He also has backing vocals on most. Dot Hacker is good. Great, even. But this is all Josh, doing mad work. At 19 years old.

A link to their FB profile. Read their most recent post. For those without Facebook, here's what it says:

""There's a real possibility that Warner could release pre IWY soundboards, dating back to the Californication tour. All that's needed is a certain level of interest. How many of you would be interested in that? Would you buy shows like you can now? It would also unlock gems like the holy grail to all John Frusciante fans - Leeds 2007. Plus many more. Me and @rhcproadtrippin are going to try and gauge a level of interest and then approach Warner about the possibility. (we have it on good authority that the shows exist and that the possibility of them being sold is real) Tell us what you think and share around to whoever you know may be interested! Cheers!""

So, yeah, that's awesome, and apparently we can make it happen. Also, could be one step closer to Warners finally releasing those unreleased tracks from the Greatest Hits sessions. Like the page and post if you can, let's make this happen. "	t5_2s504	True

""Red Hot Chili Peppers will be releasing 18 previously unreleased sides from the I'm With You sessions over the next six months. Each of the songs will be available worldwide both digitally and on 7 inch vinyl.

The first pair of sides - ""Strange Man"" on the A-side and ""Long Progression"" on the B-side - will be released on August 14, 2012. The second pair of sides - ""Magpies"" and ""Victorian Machinery"" - will be released on September 11, 2012. The third pair of sides - ""Never Is A Long Time"" and ""Love Of Your Life"" - will be released on October 2, 2012. The fourth pair of sides (titles TBD) will be released November 6, 2012. The fifth pair of sides (titles TBD) will be released December 4, 2012 and the sixth pair of sides (titles TBD) will be released December 18, 2012. The final two releases will be released in early 2013.

Each of the nine seven-inches will feature cover artwork by Kelsey Brookes, and when combined together, form one larger piece of artwork. Brookes' well-documented background in microbiology, surf culture and folk art combine in explosive prisms of raucous color, bold imagery and timeless motifs. His work has appeared in countless group shows, art fairs, and magazines such as GQ, Modern Painters, Juxtapoz, Beautiful Decay and Dazed and Confused.""

As soon as I hear that soulful guitar, my finger slides the volume all the way up. Alas, I have entered the world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. No longer do I hear the loud bustling cars rushing down the streets of Manhattan. No longer do I hear the syncopated footsteps walking next to me on the sidewalk. No longer do I hear segments of conversation in passing. I hear the music of Gods. I hear bliss.

Whatever the case i can always listen to this CD when i need something to cheer me up, its always been there when I needed it.. To be completely honest, it is the one CD where i can truly listen to and not be thinking; ""Hmmm i could've done without this song...""

I remember my first listen of Californication pretty well. It was summer 1999 and about the time I had really become interested in music on a deeper level. I was living in a small mining town in Ohio and didn't really have any friends. Music was my get away. My mom had taken me to the only mall in the area so she could get her Beanie Baby fix. We passed by a record store and I saw posters for Californication all over the front display. I was a spoiled little brat, so of course my mom said we could go in a pick up a CD. I had listened to RHCP before, but wasn't really a ""fan"" at that point. I was more interested in the heavier rock.  But something about that album just drew me in. So that's what we ended up leaving with.

As any kid, I couldn't wait to get home to listen to my new CD. The whole car ride back I was shredding away at the plastic wrap so that I could immediately start listening as soon as I was back in my room. We pull in the driveway and I dart out of my mom's van and b-line it straight into my room. I turn on the stereo, eject whatever Korn CD I had in there, and put on Californication. The CD tray retracts back, I hit play, and suddenly my room is saturated with that distinct note from Flea's bass. That note reverberated in my room for, what felt like, a life time. Then rang in a few more aggressive slaps to the bass string, followed by the angelic yet chaotic chords from Fruiscante's guitar, and then finally Anthony wailing into the mic. Even today, just thinking about the song sends chills down my spine. It's such a fantastic way to kick off the album.

My mom bought Californication on 1999 and withing 6 months I was asking her to play the CD for me. I'm overwhelmed with just the thought of seeing them live, especially since I live in a country (guatemala) where RHCP isn't exactly famous or would have a sold out show, so me seeing them is just WOW! The most expensive tickets are like $160 and I think I'm buying them in a week. Just wanted to share my joy with other funky monks and ask, what can I expect from one of their shows?

I assume everyone on this subreddit has seen RHCP's performance at Slane Castle (2003). If you haven't, drop everything and watch it now. 
I myself watch it pretty regularly, it gives me hope and inspiration to power through life. 

Something always stood out to me. During Frusciante's last solo on ""Don't Forget Me,"" the camera pans on Anthony. He's just kind of staring off into the abyss. I always wondered what's going on through his head in that moment. 

I think he's reflecting on how crazy his life was, but here he is today, reformed and at the top of his game. It took him a while to find his way, but he overcame all of his drug addictions / relationship struggles.



Anyway, that's my post. Just wanted to know if anyone had any other thoughts. Thanks. "	t5_2s504	True

I can see the whole thing unfolding right now, it would be glorious. I'd have to buy tickets.

Right around Strip My Mind I realized that they knew before the album was released that John would be leaving. Why else would they give us so much material? Such a wide range of styles from the band, a big blast of every emotion and every type of song you could want from them. There is funk, rock, ballad, pop hits, grunge, and the few near experimental songs.

They knew they would be stepping into a new era or possibly calling it to an end. I know a lot of people have something against Josh for not being John, some even broke off into this Frusciantism. Josh is not John, and nobody ever could be. I am just thankful that I was able to be a fan before the shift. As much respect as I have for I'm With You and as much as I love the songs on that album, I feel that Stadium Arcadium brings the best talent that RHCP had to offer from each member of the band with the most iconic lineup."	t5_2s504	True

They were conceived in a way similar to a bodily function. They were put together and structured out of our interest in music. They were perfected by playing them again and again which we do out of the enthusiasm we get from listening to each other and we are rewarded by the wonderment that we feel for the musical chemistry we have been blessed with. They are recorded so that they will exist for as long as humans exist. They are released so anyone can hear them. Radio has been very important for me at various times in my life. Hearing Elton John and Kiki Dees “Don’t go Breaking my Heart” or his own “Tiny Dancer” in my mom’s car and wondering how such beautiful sounds were made. Hearing the Ramones, the Clash, X, Devo, The B-52s, &amp; Talking Heads on KRQC when I was 9. Hearing The Germs, The Cramps, The Weirdos, The Circle Jerks, and Black Flag on Rodney Bingenheimers Rodney on The Rog at ages 9,10,11,and 12, laying there in the dark at night with my radio/cassette recorder listening as soft as possible because I’m supposed to be sleeping, recording all my favorite music off Rodney’s show, often taping the whole thing. Taping Donna Summers “I Feel Love” at 13 years of and realizing the stereophonic godliness that was the first completely electronic hit, wondering how music like that was made. Being 26 with no place of my own, sitting in my friend Toni’s stationary car by myself, smoking the pot and tobacco her living arrangements did not allow for me to smoke in her place, wondering was my life over or was it beginning, hearing REM and Radiohead and feeling that the radio was my companion (along with my Bob Marley and Butthole Surfers cassettes). The fact that some of our songs have reached people thru the radio is something I’m glad for. I also encourage people to find out about music in other way, lie asking questions to people you think are cool, or finding out who your favorite recording artists themselves like, or buying something because you like the cover. Being in The Red Hot Chili Peppers is something I'm very thankful for. Making music with friends and having the energetic impetus behind me that a supportive audience brings has made this past 5 years I have spent in this band the happiest ones of my life. We are all very lucky to live in a world where there is this much music.  	t5_2s504	True

*""Lots of love just keep it comin'*

*Making something out of nothin'*

*These are the best that I*

*I don't know how to say*

*Losin' what I love today*

*These are the best that I...""*


Again I know the song isn't about this, but it's so emotional to think about this song and those lyrics in that context.

1376183495.0	1k4bww	The Chili Peppers and my life	musicnotesforeyes	29	3	7	"I heard 'Soul to Squeeze' on an early morning video hits program over twenty years ago.  We didn't have music on demand from the internet or even really varied radio stations then.  I'd get up at 5 with my brother and watch Rage (Australian public TV weekly music clip show) and wait through the pop or slow country for Guns 'n Roses, Aerosmith and Bon Jovi.  Then this black and white clip comes on with a mesmerising bloke with snakes on his head and music like I'd never heard before.  I was 10 years old and for the first time music spoke to me.  Until then I'd mainly listened to what my dad was into - 70s rock and heavy metal but as cool as it was, it was his music.  This was mine.  It sent sweet fucking shivers through me.  I found out that BSSM was their latest album and talked my uncle into buying it for me.   I couldn't have bought it myself because of the parental advisory sticker.  For a minute I was bummed because the track-list (on the cassette) didn't have 'Soul to Squeeze' and that's why I'd bought it.  But then I put it in my little tape deck and got blown away.  I'm glad I got into music before there was a way to skip around or just buy the choicest tracks.  I've only ever listened to that album from start to finish because otherwise it doesn't sound right.  Every time I hear 'Give it Away' my mind anticipates 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' immediately after.  I didn't know about B-sides or anything but I got 'Soul to Squeeze' by buying a Top 40 cassette and making my own mix-tape.  
I then got seriously into all their previous stuff.  It wasn't like now where you could just google a band, it was tough to find out about my Red Hots.  No one in my town knew them or gave a shit about them.  I found 'What Hits?!' and got blown away.  Later I traded a mate's older brother for the first album cassette and 'Out in LA'.
This band became instantly and has remained one of the coolest things in my life.  When I went through the typical teenage depression shit (Nobody understands me emo shit but without the fucking hair in my face) I had dark and groovy One Hot Minute to rock the fuck out with.  In grade 12 (senior year) when I had my shit together and my first serious girlfriend she bought me their new album Californication.
To this day the RED HOT FUCKING CHILI PEPPERS have provided the soundtrack to my life.  It seems that with each great change life brings me, they bring out a new album to go with it.  My dad died around when Stadium Arcadium came out.  I put it away because it wasn't the right music. I bought James Blunt's 'Back to Bedlam' album and every time I got in my car I pushed play and bawled my eyes out as I drove around.  It was like therapy and one day I took the CD out of my car and put it in a drawer.  It's still there but I don't need it anymore.  Then as my life went forward I got into SA and it was the soundtrack for that next positive part of my life.  
I love everything they've put out.  Some more than other stuff but everything has its place.  There are days when I get in my car to drive home from work and just know, that today is a Mother's Milk day.  Tomorrow it might be IWY.  
I got the asterisk tattoo
I like other bands too
I don't think liking this band is a competition, the band's often acknowledged that they like all their fans regardless of size, age or time spent listening.
I know a fair bit about them and plan to contribute a bit more to future posts instead of just using this subreddit to get sweet youtube links.
When I was 18 I was backpacking in Peru and standing against the wall of a packed club when Give it Away came on.  I danced it in the middle of the floor life a man at one with everything and immediately afterwards a chick walked up and said 'that was hot'.  I fucked her.  Because of the Peppers.  One of many ways they have enhanced my life.  
I can't wait for the next album...

Self Titled: True Men Don't Kill Coyotes

Freaky Styley: Jungleman

Uplift Mofo Party Plan: Fight Like A Brave

Mother's Milk: Good Time Boys

Blood Sugar Sex Magik: The Power of Equality

One Hot Minute: Warped

Californication: Around the World

By the Way: By the Way

Stadium Arcadium: Dani California

I'm With You: Monarchy of Roses

Personally, my favorite opener, for the sake of an opener, is The Power of Equality off of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It tells the listener exactly what kind of a funky, filthy, album they're geared to listen to and perfectly leads into If You Have to Ask. A close second is Jungleman, almost for the same reason.

So, I decided to go through the songs, and try and split them up into two discs. I put them in the order I thought would sound best, 15 tracks on the first disc and 16 on the second. I also gave it a new name, Pink As Floyd. Not that I dislike the name I'm With You (especially after hearing ""Open/Close"", ""What ever you wanna do man, I'm coming with you. I'm right with you my friend""), but because the song ""Pink As Floyd"" lyrically seems like a welcoming to Josh. I had some fun doing this, and though you may not agree with my track listing, I figure I'd share with you lovely folks. Here it is, try and listen to the tracks in this order, and let me know what you think.

Pink As Floyd- Disc One
1. Long Progression
2. Factory Of Faith
3. Never Is A Long Time
4. Brendan's Death Song
5. Victorian Machinery
6. The Adventures Of Raindance Maggie
7. Love Of Your Life

9. Look Around
10. This Is The Kitt
11. How It Ends
12. Dance, Dance, Dance

Pink As Floyd- Disc Two
1. Monarchy Of Roses
2. Strange Man
3. Brave From Afar
4. Magpies On Fire
5. Did I Let You Know
6. The Sunset Sleeps
7. Happiness Loves Company

The concert was obviously amazing - but I have one complaint. I found that Anthony doesn't really communicate with/really acknowledge the audience. Obviously Flea does, but seeing as Anthony is the lead singer you would think he would too and more so. I watched the Coachella performance online last night too and found the same thing with Anthony.

So my question is do other people that have seen them live find this to be the case too? And to older fans, was it always like this?

For examples follow the link.  Since the Red Hot Chili Peppers have such a huge discography I thought we could do the same thing with their individual songs.  We would obviously start with the letter A today and we would comment following some basic rules

  1.  For the ease of the reader the song should be submitted in the following format, [Aeroplane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV8IAOojoAA) *One Hot Minute*

  2.  You may submit any performance of the song you want and any song performed by RHCP at some point will be accepted as long as the video presented is of them performing it

  3.  Be nice and don't downvote songs just because you don't like them

If this is a success I will continue the alphabet in following days.  Have fun and hopefully introduce us to some new music by RHCP

1358178877.0	16k00w	Lets hear some opinions from /r/RedHotChiliPeppers on the similarities between Dani California and Tom Petty's 'Mary Janes Last Dance' 	wesleyt89	27	7	16	"Idk if anyone else remembers when SA came out there was a big outburst of people saying the Chili Peppers ripped off of Tom Petty.  They were rumors of Petty filing a lawsuit and ironically producer Rick Ruben recorded both songs.  Petty later made a statement in a Rolling Stones interview denouncing these rumors.

 'Everyone everywhere is stopping me. The truth is, I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock &amp; roll songs sound alike. Ask Chuck Berry. The Strokes took “American Girl” [for their song “Last Nite”], and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, “OK, good for you.” It doesn’t bother me ... If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously, then maybe. But I don’t believe in lawsuits much. I think there are enough frivolous lawsuits in this country without people fighting over pop songs.'


So what are your'e guys thoughts on this?  In [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZNgRn2054Y) video John jokingly calls Under The Bridge a rip-off as he plays a couple songs that he took ideas from and used them in Under The Bridge.  Its clear he didn't really plagiarize those songs to make Under the Bridge though, he just took ideas from it.

The buzz on these guys was beginning to blow up again. The 30 or so subscribers were stoked to see this rise in fellow (redditor) fans. We have had the same mods since approximately that time and I'm sure we all love the attention that this page now gets, just because people want to come see if the band has a reddit page. There really is no other reason for January being r/redhotchilipeppers biggest traffic month yet (with more days left and the arrow only facing up for us) than the fact that rhcp just makes people feel good and they truly are just out of this world yet so down to earth.
