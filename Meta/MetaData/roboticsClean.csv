Hi /r/Robotics,

I'm not kidding when I say I built this guy from scratch.  Not only did I make almost every component myself (minus some of the electronics and the servos), I also built all the machines it was fabricated on:

Buildlog of the hexapod is here:

Buildlogs of my laser cutter and cnc mill/lathe are here:

There is still some software work to be done on the hexapod but things are looking good.

I have a lot of toys but if you are careful this stuff can be built quite cheaply and you learn a lot in the process.  I am completely self taught and everything I know was picked up via the internet."	t5_2qh0p	True

Well, not completely immersive, I discovered that I should be piping the audio as well... maybe the project is not complete after all...

I am getting tired of losing time playing video games (sry r/gaming) and I know I would have more intellectual fun and pride buidling something. So I was thinking of robots. 

1. Is it a stupid idea?
2. If not, how to start? I wish I can do it learning by practise, possible?
3. Any estimation of the budget in this field? I suppose it probably depends of the objective/materials/etc. but can u provide some exemples from ur xp? 

I am an engineer (just finishing my degrees) in telecoms, electrics, informatics (we do lot of different stuff - French engineering if someone wanders). 

Thank you for any help or advice!

Sorry for the hooby hobby mistake ;-)

1376536149.0	1ke9fp	A couple ideas for the subreddit	cmurobotics	42	7	18	"Looking at all of these 'How do I learn to build a robot?' posts submitted to /r/robotics, and the variance in skill set/experience/age between all of the questioners, I would like to propose an idea. It might be nice to have some sort of introductory project that we host here on /r/robotics, designed, completed, and moderated by a couple experienced members.

We would design a fairly simple/cheap project, with design/build steps that embody all the facets of robotics (manufacturing, actuation, sensing, A.I., perception, etc.). These design/build steps could either result in a complete robot, or the first few could result in a complete robot, with other steps adding modular components. I realize there are plenty of robot tutorials out there, but (correct me if I am wrong) from my experience, most are either boring, not cost-effective, or do not introduce you to the different depths that you can go into when doing a design/build (e.g. sparkfun boards vs custom PCB's, different sensing methodologies, using existing libraries vs. creating your own). Essentially, I think I would have been interested in a broad guide to beginner's robotics describing what software/hardware is out there, and how you can easily and effectively integrate it into a working robot, as described in a project tutorial. Feedback?

On a side note, I think collaborating on hobby projects could be very fun, and bring quite a bit of knowledge to the table. I was also wondering whether, in addition to having the subreddit be a forum for specific robotics questions, we could host a collaboration thread every week where we, in essence, conduct an informal, high level design review of an specific idea/design (e.g. two legged spider killing laser turret), and suggest more cost-effective, relevant, and simple additions/changes to the design. Through these, I think we will all be able to gain some insight into what techniques/materials/algorithms have been used where, and how we can apply them, not only to the project at hand, but to others as well. This sort of forum where a lot of knowledge is centralized is a very powerful resource. Feedback?

**EDIT:** The responses have been varied, but helpful. Based on the reactions, I think it would be valuable to put together a general beginner's guide to making a robot, as well as start developing/testing designs for build tutorials that draw from the guide. The guide could include beginner's sections, common problems, general hardware information, as well as delve into some more advanced theory. I envision it as a general framework that can easily be modified and expanded by different people; this would bring a lot more information into play than having a single person decide/create the content. I do not know if there is a good way to do this on reddit; I was thinking about having a link tree structure, the base of which could be easily accessible (e.g. sidebar), but I do not know how to do this. I would love it if other people took an interest in contributing as well, and had any other ideas.

As some have pointed out, fantastic beginner's kits exist out there in the market. However, many of these kits (not all) are very specific; that is, they really only let you design a robot in a certain way that can do certain things. Even the more general kits out there (e.g. Ardu-bot) do not leave you with a whole lot of room in the design department. I would like to really push robot customization with this effort, and enable people to look up a lot of information about how they could possibly do something.

In essence, I think that this effort should be three-fold. 

* **Robotics Guide**: Create a robotics guide as described above
* **Educational Robot Design**: Come up with custom robot designs that exemplify certain facets of robotics (as described above) and build/document them. Some of these can be low-cost, beginner designs that practically anyone can actually make; others, as /u/eubarch suggested, could be more advanced, unique designs that show off some advanced robotics stuff, which may be more challenging to build. I think a suggestion/voting thread would be ideal for this. Maybe we could do one every quarter or something?
* **Design Suggestions**: Start a thread to suggest designs for people who are new to robotics. In essence, cool, unique ideas that people may want to pursue further on their own. As opposed to the design from the previous bullet, these should be more 'out there' and don't necessarily need to be designed to educate people about how to build robots.

Before starting these threads, I wanted to get some more feedback, and see if anyone else was interested in contributing. I also want to start a thread where people can suggest topics for the guide. Feedback?"	t5_2qh0p	True

This was last years bot and it went 3-2 in a double elimination tournament with myself at the controls.  I was also the one who did all of the computer drafting for the bot, so in a sense, I did most of the designing but, obviously, every member of the team was just as important as the last.  I can't wait for this years competition, the time has almost come for us to get back to work.  If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them.  Descriptions are in the album.  There are tons more pictures but uploading all of them would take a while.

EDIT: Here is the video of the entire comp. You can look for my bot ""Team Matrix Major Destruction"" or watch whichever parts you'd like. Enjoy

EDIT 2: Sorry, I guess I didn't realize how terrible some of those pictures are, haha. My buddies have all the good ones so that'll have to do.  Ill be sure to take tons of pictures of this years bot!

ive been trying to think of ways to help him, and as soon as i mentioned he build a robot to take his mind off things he completely lit up. problem is, he says he cant afford several crucial things, one of them being a power transverter and various expensive adapters.

i know absolutely nothing about this, but is there anyway he could either build these, get around using them, or find them for cheap?
any help would be appreciated greatly  

edit: thank you every one for all your amazing help. i showed him this thread and he really appreciated it. he told me to add- He has a fully functioning battle bot that he doesnt know what to do with, suggestions?"	t5_2qh0p	True

I don't have any experience building drones/UAVs but I would like to build a drone that can be controlled with my laptop. (input coordinates then drone flies to that location). Currently, I am thinking about purchasing multicopter but I don't know which company makes good product. 

here are my questions: 

1. Is there any comprehensive website that explain UAV build for a newbie? (I know there are couple websites that explains basic structures of a drone/uav but they are not that helpful)

2. how much budget do I need?

3. what brand do you recommend for drone or parts(and why)?

4. Is it possible to control multiple drones with single computer or controller?

5. What are the risks?

6. how difficult is building a drone?

I entered my car into a design contest.  See the video below and there's a survey in the video description to for for it if you like. Thanks!

[autonomous car video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrCWLSO1FBU)


The car is based on a 1/10 scale RC car.  For the localization I used GPS/gyroscope sensors and a Kalman filter.  I had originally built all the electronics on a breadboard but that was a bit of a disaster.  The car was always knocking things loose so I decided to try building a PCB shield for the microcontroller.  I had never done that before either and surprisingly the PCB worked too.  

I tried to keep track of the progress on my website

[This is where i am starting with the kinematics and code](http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/tutorials/introduction-129/delta-robot-kinematics-3276/)(near bottom of page)

So [here's a cad drawing of my initial concept](http://imgur.com/WlW0m.png). I have not decided the lengths of the two arms yet, so those are not necessarily what the final sizes will be. I am only putting a single diffused RGB LED on the end of the arm, so it will end up being  quite small. My question is about the initial value setup per the code provided at the end of that first link.

&gt;// robot geometry

&gt;// (look at pics above for explanation)

&gt; float e = 115.0;     // end effector

&gt; float f = 457.3;     // base

&gt; float re = 232.0;   

&gt; float rf = 112.0;    

are the values 're' and  'rf' the radius of point e1 and f1 in [this image](http://imgur.com/eWP2R.gif) and thus the lengths of the two segments for each arm? and if so, what do the first two variables, 'end effector'(e) and 'base'(f), refer to? 

If anyone understands what I am asking and could clear this up a bit, I'd greatly appreciate it. By the way, I am trying to get the coding done before I send off to have the parts 3D printed, so I can finalize my design before spending any money. "	t5_2qh0p	True

So I have a lot of huge dreams when it comes to building robotic devices. Some of these are almost impossible, but exploring them has shown me what is possible and what I can do, and has opened the doors to a lot of fun projects I have completed.

Now that the abstract time is over, I thought I would share my most recent idea. I have started building an Iron Man helmet using the Pepakura method. For those who are unfamiliar, you basically use the software to turn a 3D model into a bunch of pieces of paper that you cut and glue together, then fiberglass, bondo, and paint it to create a strong replica of the 3D model. Here is my helmet so far: http://imgur.com/a/dd2P2#0 .

There are several ways to go about the eye holes. Some people have just left the holes, some have covered half the eye hole with an LED lit panel to shine white, some have completely covered the eye hole with LEDs, but none have done what was in the movie. Augmented Reality.

Augmented Reality is way too complex for me to care to learn. I don't necessarily want a complex HUD. But another concept, Virtual Reality, seems much more plausible. I was thinking if I could mount a small, undetectable webcam on the helmet, and use a pair of Virtual Reality glasses, I could make the coolest Iron Man helmet ever. Of course I'd have the mask open with motors, which is why I posted this is r/robotics, so the helmet would be an almost exact replica. 

I came across these: http://www.dhgate.com/hot-selling-52-inch-virtual-reality-glass/p-ff808081384b90c701386c4561a8586b.html#s1-1-1 . I wanted to know if anyone has any experience with virtual reality glasses, streaming from a webcam to virtual reality glasses, delays in vision, image quality, anything. This is a complete hypothetical idea, but hopefully it will pave the way towards something that is do-able. "	t5_2qh0p	True

1340034157.0	v87nk	Advice for a wannabe robotics engineer...?	cr0sh	25	6	43	"I'm in the market for a new job. Currently, I have over 20 years of experience as a software developer in a variety of languages. For the past 8 years or so, the focus has been on web development using a LAMP stack, and it is likely where I am going to find my next position.

I don't expect to be employed right now in the robotics marketplace, but I am wondering whether what I am currently doing in my spare time could lead me in that direction: Off and on, I have been in the process of building a small unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The scope of this project isn't small, but it isn't overwhelming, either. I have a rough overall plan on where and how I want to proceed with it, but it is still rather ""ad-hoc"".

In addition to this project, I have also been taking a few free online classes; last year I took the online Machine Learning course from Stanford (now offered by Coursera), and I just completed the CS373 course from Udacity. I feel that by taking these courses, the knowledge gained from them can only help me on the software side of things when it comes to my project (while also, to a certain extent, make me more marketable when in comes to my present career path). One thing I did learn was that I need to take a course or two in probability and/or statistics, which I plan to pursue later this year.

My idea with this project, ultimately, is to completely develop this UGV to the point where I can use it both for its intended purpose, as well as to better develop the programming skills for robotics. Depending on how the system turns out (and whether funding is available), I might take it to the next level and move it from being based around a toy vehicle platform (currently a PowerWheels ride-on), to something more advanced (maybe a quad-cycle or another similar off-road vehicle).

I don't have a degree in engineering or anything, and there really isn't any hope of me obtaining one at this stage in my life (financial, time and other obligations rule that out). So the question is, despite not having such a qualification, is there any hope for me turning my career towards this direction, or am I likely relegated to it always being a hobby? If there is some hope, what more should I be doing in this pursuit?"	t5_2qh0p	True

So it's been a slow week at my internship, and I have a couple of weeks left with nothing to do. I'm thinking about picking up a new programming language. I'm good with Java (two summer internships that were exclusively java) and learned C about 3 years ago, though I don't really remember much about it.

Some personal background: I'm a senior in college studying electrical engineering, though I decided I like software more so I am taking Software Systems as my depth sequence. (Basically those classes are on: data structures, algorithms, basic OS stuff, and some (little) embedded design). Like I said, both of my last two summer internships were in Java, and the first one is actually where I picked up the language for the first time. I'm definitely interested in robotics though I'm not sure if I'll end up there yet after I graduate. 

So, any suggestions for a new language?"	t5_2qh0p	True

I put Petman because I like how human like it motions are. Big dog for it agility. Nao for it relative cheap price for all it can do.

1335595098.0	swiy4	Question for you robotics people from a welder.	HonestAbe109	21	2	34	"I'm a structural welder.  Many of the processes I use are considered manual or semi-automatic.  Meaning I'm doing most, or all of the manipulation (pulling a trigger and aiming a gun that wire comes out of).  More recently I've been trained to use automatics, meaning I push buttons and flip switches on a machine that runs on a track but has no ""brain"".  I'm well aware that there are robot welders, but as far as I know they are programed to do very specific and repetitive tasks, such as make the same weld over and over again in an assembly line.

I've been poking around the internet, and I can't find anything about a more flexible and adaptive system.  I've heard welding described as part science and part art.  The best welders an look at a molten pool of metal while they're working, and make changes in real time to their angle, travel speed, and many other variables.  They can also determine if the parameters on the machine are set correctly (volts and wire speed/amperes) to achieve the best and most uniform result.

I simply wonder if a robotics engineer could team up with a welder and come up with a more adaptive system.  For example, a wire feed system that can drive itself around.  The user inputs the sizes of the base material (say a flat fillet weld of mild steel, 1/4"" to 5/16"", with a weld size of 3/16""), draw a guideline for the robot to follow, the robot would adjust it's parameters, position itself, and with permission from the user, start welding, adapting on the fly to minor changes in conditions.  I imagine it could potentially monitor temperature and visual cues to make adjustments.  

Is this just a crazy pipe dream or potentially possible in the world of robotics?"	t5_2qh0p	True

I am a software developer who recently started to play around with an Arduino. It was always some kind of wish to build my own robot. So I just got myself the Arduino and bought a servo motor to play around with.

Controlling the servo was easier than I thought, so I want to go to the next step: building a leg. My goal would be to have some kind of Hexapod at the end.

Now comes the hard part for me: What the hell do I use to build such a leg? Just buy a Lego box and try to attach the servo somehow? Maybe it's better to buy a complete leg, so I can focus on the coding part? Is there something like Lego for grown ups that I can use?

What do you think of creating a list of good robotics communities?
I know a few, but I'm sure it isn't a comprehensive list.

Here are mine:  
[Let's make Robots](http://letsmakerobots.com/) - Facebook for robots  
[Trossen Robotics Forums](http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/forum.php) - Community based around walkers, pretty active  
[Society of Robots](http://www.societyofrobots.com/robotforum/) - General robotics forum, less active  
[Arduino Forums](http://forum.arduino.cc/) - Forums based around Arduino, but they do have a robotics topic

1368451900.0	1e8r8a	No robot experience, Looking to Learn, what are the best resources?	Gr8AlphaOgre	25	7	18	"I have looked into learning robotics and programming off and on for a few years. I recently found an application that I could use robotics for that would give me a goal and keep me motivated. What I need are good resources for an intermediate to beginner level. I started with intermediate because I am rather handy and clever but lack education in robotics specifically. I have checked into the Lego kits and several other kits but they do not seem to be quite what I need. 

My application is going to be animatronics, specifically puppetry. I would like to be able to build the internal components for a puppet and have it be controlable by an xbox 360 controller. All of this is subject and open to change as i learn about better alternatives. some of the components will be small and so a puppet similar to the action figures in ""Small Soldiers"" is the best way I can describe it. http://p2.la-img.com/930/16511/5467839_1_l.jpg

 I have seen kits and tools but I can't justify spending 400 dollars on a learning tool that I will not be able to use for the finished product. I am absolutely open to suggestions and if anyone can point me in a good direction I would appreciate it. 

I did not see a FAQ, I looked on the side bar for beginner links or sticky topics, sorry if this is a repost.

TLDR : I want to make a cable controlled puppet. I need to learn but don't want to start at the very bottom, I'd like a kit that can grow from intermediate to expert."	t5_2qh0p	True

Rather than write you a cover letter, I'll make it brief.
I am a sophomore in electrical engineering at UIUC, we don't have many robotics companies in the area (most are around MIT), but I really want to work with one next summer.

I am planning my academics around robotics, and next semester I will be taking intro to robotics and artificial intelligence (if everything goes as planned).

I have tried contacting iRobot and Boston Dynamics, but haven't received a response from either.

Does anyone have any connection to either of those companies? I only need an email, and I'll do the rest!

&gt;The US Navy bought the patent from Ilon and put researchers to work on it in the 1980s in Panama City. The Navy has used it for transporting items around ships. In 1997 Airtrax Inc. and several other companies each paid the Navy $2,500 for rights to the technology, including old drawings of how the motors and controllers worked, to build an omni-directional forklift truck that could maneuver in tight spaces such as the deck of an aircraft carrier. These vehicles are now in production.

This is a simple line following robot for a robotics course I'm taking. It's a simple algorithm. If it's on the line, turn right (away from the line), else turn left (back onto the line) and it seems to work pretty well.

The most annoying part of construction was actually finding the right thing to use for the third wheel (to stabilize the base of a differential drive robot). We considered some round surfaces to drag along the ground and some claw type things which generated an insanely annoying noise and made the robot look like a headcrab \([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4EULd-LYfs)\), but those all didn't work because they generated too much friction on the tape line. But caster wheels have the annoying characteristic of slightly changing the direction, which we could live with.

Also had to deal with wheel slip issues if our motor inputs were too high.

Anyways, enjoy and please share your comments!"	t5_2qh0p	True

In the vid the robot is controlled by my iPhone using an app called OSCemote. OSCemote sends OSC (Open Sound Control) commands to my PC over wifi which is running a custom python OSC server. The python script then outputs commands to an XBee module in transparent serial mode connected via USB. 

The robot has an Arduino as it's main controller. It receives commands from the PC via an attached XBee node and controls the 2 servos to make the robot move.
