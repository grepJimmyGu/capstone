Seeing as [the original inspiration for this subreddit was titled ""Most polite disagreement ever.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/1e3cdd/haiku_most_polite_disagreement_ever/c9wldnb?context=3) I assumed this subreddit would focus on content that's exemplary in civility, not /r/faithinhumanity but more of a happy contrast to /r/justiceporn where disagreements end badly for one side.

What are we aiming for here?

I personally think we should promote the surprisingly civil shtick. Here are some examples:
