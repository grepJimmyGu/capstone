Yeah freddy didnt back down from your jockying when he was in position; he's on the brink of requalification. He's still got a career on the CT ahead of him, your surfing career is all but done. Fuck your using intimidation tactics to bully a fellow hawaiian that needs it more, especially after the heat is over and it wont even help you anymore anyway.

Sunny doesnt embody aloha, and i hate that hes been a face of hawaiian surfing all these years. I'm from hawaii and i approve the sunny hating circlejerk."	t5_2qmde	True

Anyway, when I first got out there, there was a seal hunting on the reef. A big guy as far as seals go (not a sealion). Saw him chomp down 3 decent fish while I was sitting between sets. I had a few nice waves myself. On one of my waves, while paddling for it I noticed the seal about 2m inside me bodysurfing the same wave. It was awesome.

When I kicked out, feeling maximum stoke after a sick wave, I nearly shat myself when a dark shape came and circled me. Shark was the first thought, but then he popped his head out the water, the seal. He looked me right in the face, only about 2m from me, and barked at me. I thought he was going to tear me apart, but he just snorted his fishy breath at me then turned and disappeared underwater.

Took me a while to realise, but he must have been pissed that I blatantly dropped in on him. I felt like a grom again, getting told by the older dudes after doing something stupid."	t5_2qmde	True

1370732295.0	1fy8w5	Found one of my stolen boards today!!!	dumbassthenes	122	12	67	"Oh man! So, the wife and I went out looking to pick up a wetsuit for her this morning, and when they didn't have any that fit perfectly at Xcel, drove over to Surf n Sea to see what they had in stock.

As we walked up, what did I see on their used board rack? Why, an awesome Marcello Vercelli shaped 6'0 Gemini that was stolen from me about a year ago.

Now, this is a total one off shape.  It is a [Gemini shape](http://www.lalasurfboards.com/img/boards/gemini.jpg) with a bright yellow and red airbrush, double wing bat tail, futures quad. It was shaped by Marcello as a personal board and given to me as a gift.  It was the only Gemini ever made by Vercelli

We told an employee that it was my board and had been stolen. She got the manager, Bobby. At first, Bobby was helpful, offered to tell us who sold them the board. He went to get the info, and came back in a totally different mood. All of a sudden he's starts throwing out terms like, ""chain of custody,"" and saying that since we didn't file a report (cops wouldn't take one) we couldn't prove it was ours. Dude watched a little too much Law and Order.  I mean, fuck, my wife is an attorney, we were the wrong couple to try and mislead.

His compromise was that I leave my name and phone number and the guy who had put my stolen board on consignment would call me and I could ""work it out."" Meaning, pay for my stolen surfboard. No fucking way. 

He continued to stone wall us, and refused to let me see if any of the other boards that had been stolen were in the back. So, we called the cops.

Now the board is on its way to an evidence locker in Wahiawa, and I'm pressing charges. Fuck those guys.

Moral of the story: If you've had a board stolen from you on Oahu, go check the Surf N Sea rack. They buy and sell stolen surfboards.

PS- The cops were pretty cool and helpful, which was nice."	t5_2qmde	True

1374624858.0	1ix72j	So I lost my bike today...	bengarrr	117	7	8	"**EDIT: Title should say yesterday haha**

You might be wondering what the hell this has to do with surfing, just bear with me. So about a year ago I inherited this sweet old mountain bike from my dad, it was about 20 years old, and he had ridden it back in his mountain biking days. It was my primary transportation to and from my university campus and was my go to for cardio days. Needless to say I loved the thing. It had its fair share of problems being 20 years old and all, slipping gears, brake locking etc. But I was able to fix most of them. I kept it clean, well oiled and it ran fine; it treated me so well up until yesterday when it was stolen out of my apartment complex's lock up. Well I'm actually not sure when it was stolen cause I hadn't ridden it in a few days; hurt my ankle playing basketball so I couldn't ride. I was devastated and my land lord told me there was nothing he could do except help me file a police report. So my day had just taken a turn for the worse, but here's where it turned around. 

Coincidentally I had scheduled to meet up with a dude to buy a used board off him. I didn't really want to go cause I was depressed, but I didn't want to be a flake so I went anyways. I went and met up with the guy and he showed me the board, it was everything I wanted and he was selling it cheap for the condition it was in. $300 for a practically brand new 6'2"" firewire stealth (no yellowing, no dings, just a scratch on the finish that didn't even puncture). So instantly I perked up. 

We got to talking and I told him basically the story I told above. All of a sudden he's like, ""Well I'll give it to you for $200 so you can have some left over to get a new bike."" I was floored, it was unbelievable how kind he was. At first I told him I couldn't let him do that, I didn't want him to have to drop the price just for me. He stopped as I was protesting and said, ""Dude, I've been in your position and someone I knew did me a solid, don't think of this as charity, just think of it as good will and pass it on when you get the chance."" The guy instantly became this sage like surf monk, I was so gracious I didn't even know what to say. Then he told me to wait where I was and he ran home real quick and grabbed me a set of old quad fins. At this point I was ready to build a statue in his honor, but instead I forced him to accept an offer of $220 for throwing in the fins. I said thanks again and we parted ways. 

He probably doesn't know, but to a broke college student, that act of kindness meant the world. I got to surf my new plank this morning, and it may have been small and cold, but it was one of the best surfs I've had in the last few years. So in honor of that dude I wrote this, hopefully passing on some of the stoke.

Because sweet mother, it's glorious! I've always felt connected to the ocean when surfing, but surfing while high is like making love to her. Everything flows so perfectly, and being able to play with that flow and be a part of it... it's just straight up beautiful.

And yes, I would say that my performance is worse (in terms of how I'd score in a competition). But the criticality of a turn, or the depth of a barrel doesn't matter when you're high. All that matters is fitting into that flow perfectly, and riding the wave as it's presenting itself to be ridden. And when you can do that, nothing feels better!

All I can say is try it. Or don't, that's totally sweet too! Either way, surfing is an amazing feeling."	t5_2qmde	True

I think I speak for the entire community when I say, ""enough is enough.""  It's bad enough that the lineups are clogged with beginners, to deal with the same thing in /r/surfing is a nuisance I no longer care to deal with.

As such, effective tomorrow, /r/surfing will make a change for the better, and only allow approved submitters to post, and/or comment.  It will not be made private, so the majority of you will be able to view the subreddit, but we will no longer be forced to deal with kook questions regarding ""beginner boards"" or ""where are the best secret spots in LA County.""

Furthermore, going forward all posts that do not relate to mainstream surfing will be removed, and submitters will have their posting privileges rescinded.  This means:

No Longboard retro bullshit

No boogieboards

No SUPs

No fucking mini simmonses

No more ""the best surfer is the dude having the most fun"" nonsense

No surfing chicks

No twinnies

No Stinkbug go pro flail footage (if you're not ripping, fuck right off)

In order to apply for approved submitter status please PM the following info to /u/blackkettle, who will be parsing all applications:

1.  Board/ shaper/ dimensions

2. Years surfing

3.  Biggest air you've done

4.  Best contest result

5.  Favorite surfer (naming a female will result in instant disqualification)

6.  Three surf trips you've taken

7.  Link to a three minute, edited and set to music, clip of you surfing.  All clips must include at least one made barrel, and three different air variations

To the rest of you barneys, enjoy today, because tomorrow you'll be silenced.






**EDIT**-  Well, I hope that was as fun for all of you as it was for me.  

To the people who unsubscribed today- shoot me a PM, I'll help ya' untwist those panties."	t5_2qmde	True

We were sitting out in the line up when a perfect left came rolling through (Im goofy foot). As i was paddling i felt the wave push me up, it was a late drop in, so the mist of the wave was blowing into my face. I was riding a 5'9'' so it felt like i was on a twig compared to this wave. As i was going down, i looked up at this curling lip. I pulled up into the barrel. It felt like a life changing experience. I could see the sun through the top of the barrel. I only rode in it for two seconds but it felt like time froze. As i came out of the barrel, i could hear ""Yewww"" from around the line up. I rode the wave all the way to the inside."	t5_2qmde	True

Which is cool.  People have questions.  But, how about, instead of just answering every post, we just finally do an FAQ.

R/Hawaii did something similar and it works pretty well.

So, here's how it'll work.  Headings in **bold**, fill in comments below.  I'll start it off with a few, you all add more that I miss.

As far as the general tone... well, do whatever you want.  If someone has no idea what they're saying, call them out.  If someone calls bullshit on you, defend yourself.  

If you've only been surfing a short time, please, contribute.  Beginners can give a perspective life long surfers lack.

TL;DR:  Surfing FAQ, everyone contribute."	t5_2qmde	True

It was about chest high with some plus sets and I was out on the log (9'6 Stewart).  Well, a plus plus set came though so I paddled out to it and snagged it on my back side at the last minute.  I had way too much speed on the drop so the tail slid out about 30 or 40 degrees on the bottom turn.  Once I straightened back out, I realized that the slide stalled me out and put me right in the sweet spot.  I could see a good 20 yards of lip forming up ahead and peeling over my head perfectly.   At this point it felt like the only thing in the water is the knife edge of my rail, like I was standing out on a shelf.  Things got dark as the wave covered me up and blocked the sunlight.  The sound was strange, almost like being under water, or when your ears need to pop.  I could feel the transition in my board from being all on rail to when the foam ball started to lift straight up on my tail as I accelerated out into the open face. I kicked out to watch the spray and mist float by, adrenalin pumping, yet surprisingly calm and satisfied.  Another barrel ride.	t5_2qmde	True

1368434025.0	1e8glf	Thought I'd share a story of an amazing stoke.	Gritix	77	8	13	So I'm still a young ling and I've been surfing for quite some time but have never experienced anything above 6-7 foot waves. On a normal good day my normal surf spot (trestles) can get up to 5 foot but fairly rare to climb past that. Me and my cousin went out at cottons to change it up a bit because we normally head out at lowers or uppers. This was last week and cottons was getting pretty huge and I was really excited! The thing i didn't know was that I was about to end up farther out by accidental positioning right as a freak outside set came in, and it was all for me. It was forming a lip right as i was at the base so i couldn't have been in a better spot. The adrenaline rush started to kick in as I saw a couple guys a short bit in cheering me on so I had to go. I paddled and in no time i was starting to stand up on my super tiny board (5'6). While on the lip feeling the thick mist in my face and the incoming drop was amazing. The drop was the best part of the wave, it felt like forever and i flew down the wave like a toothpick.  All I can remember is hitting the bottom of the wave and seeing the wave tower so far above my head. I cant say how big it was for fear of exaggeration but it was the biggest wave I've ever surfed and I couldn't of had a better day! Also got a couple compliments on the way back out which shows how great the surfing community really is. Sorry for any errors, its really late.	t5_2qmde	True

I surfed the beachbreak for a while, got some nice short rides, and then decided to paddle out to the main lineup. The waves were nice, peeling and maybe shoulder to head high, but it was crowded. Really crowded. But over to the left, kind of a long paddle, was this perfect fucking A-frame barrel going off occasionally on the sandbar in front of bolinas channel. I paddled over to it and there was only like 2 other guys, who were super nice and fun to talk to. It took me a few waves to get used to the steep drop and takeoff, but finally I started getting into these waves and getting good rides. There was this one wave that was just rolling in, and I got the hi sign from the other guys to take it. It was another really steep takeoff so I had to grab the rails and kinda dig in to get going. all I remember was water coming over the top of my head, and it was fucking awesome. I didnt make it out, but still. Awesome.	t5_2qmde	True

It was a fun, clean 2ft swell (perfect for me), and I happened to be sitting too far out when a 3-4 footer rolled in. Everyone else was paddling out to avoid getting wiped out, but I realised that I could probably just make the wave. I turned around and waited, and waited, until it looked like it was about to break on me. I almost thought about chickening out until I heard someone yell 'Go, go, go!' and just went for it.

it only took a couple of strokes to get onto it, a very late takeoff, but I screamed down the face, almost getting barrelled. I came off the end feeling like I wanted to claim it, but common sense stopped me from looking like a douche.

It was awesome paddling back out to the lineup and getting props from everyone out there. It seems like no time at all between now and when I would have never considered catching a wave like that, so I'm really happy with how much more confident I feel in the water.

Just wanted to share a great stoke with you guys."	t5_2qmde	True

You've probably got a ton of questions, about everything from surf tables, to wax brands to assorted generally kookery.  Well, we've got you covered.  Wax goes on the bottom, leash on your left wrist.

But, in all seriousness, everyone has the same questions when they're starting, and to keep the subreddit from getting flooded with identical posts, the whole /r/surfing community got together a few months ago and made an FAQ.  I think we did a great job, and while it's been posted on the sidebar for a while, it was at the bottom, where you couldn't really see it.

So, now, look at the right side of your screen, it's on there.  I could link to it here, but I don't want to, because I took the trouble of putting it over there.

I got a call off one of the body boarders asking would I be interested in getting some photos of the place. From the beach its probably a mile straight out, I ended up launching off the rocks parallel to it, which was probably a 15-20min swim across. I nearly decided when I half way across that I didnt need the contents of my bowls anymore when something brushed off my leg when I was over deep water.

If you're going to take a camera and attach it to yourself or your board and take it out into the surf, odds are pretty good you're going to take at least a few beatdowns and risk losing the camera.  It is simple to put a text file or word doc on the SD card with your contact info, or even just take a picture of a piece of paper with your contact info and leave it as the first file on the camera.  It takes two seconds, and most people would probably return a found camera if they knew who to return it too.  You could also put a sticker with your contact info on the camera (but inside the housing) to make it even easier.

1369564232.0	1f2r67	One little (beginner) tip that changed my shortboard paddling technique. Thought I'd share.	thephorest	60	7	19	"I've spent the past 2 years on a funboard and decided last week to bite the bullet and get a shortboard. The first thing I noticed is how SLOW I was in the water, paddle speed wise. With my funboard I could get a good glide going and pop right up on the wave. Not so with the shortboard! Every wave seemed to go right under me. 

So, as I was paddling out I noticed this one really experienced guy in the lineup. We ended up paddling back out at right about the same time...and he literally was going twice as fast as me with about the same number of strokes. It got me thinking...and from behind I noticed the placement of his feet. He had his feet held up slightly out of the water and one ankle crossed over the other. He was flying! So I gave it a shot. WOW. This whole time I'd been dragging my feet. I'd been keeping my toes pointed down. They were dragging in the water and slowing me down. 

Since then I've been trying to keep my feet together and my toes pointed backwards. It has made a huge difference in my surfing! I can paddle out much quicker, and get going on a wave much quicker. Also, it shifts my weight forward so I can really feel exactly where my chest is pressed on the board. I can feel if I'm on the sweet spot or not. 

Anyway, I'd been focused so much on my upper body placement that I totally forgot about my feet dragging back there! Just thought some other newbs like myself might find this useful. 

TLDR: Don't drag your feet!!"	t5_2qmde	True

1338522715.0	uf35b	Announcing the GREAT REDDIT SURF OFF!	dumbassthenes	65	7	41	"The mods are proud to announce the first ever,   **Great Reddit Surf Off!**

It's going to be a video contest, where any member of r/surfing can submit a video of themselves riding waves, and, in turn, win prizes.  The contest will be a quarterly contest, with the top three picked by the community, and of the final twelve, the top four (chosen by the mods) will be given sweet stuff, or maybe lame shit, that's to be seen.

**Submission guidelines are as follows:**

All submissions must be **at least two minutes long**, no maximum length.

All entries must be posted on [r/redditsurfoff](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditsurfoff/) (this is to keep them from getting lost), feel free to also post them on r/surfing, but, remember, only upvotes on r/redditsurfoff count towards your total.

**Any form of wave riding is allowed.**

One entry per person, per quarter.  If you submit a clip, and then make a better one, you can remove the first, but any upvotes will not carry over.

**Judging Guidelines:**

This is not a contest meant to find the best surfer on reddit.  Ability level is secondary to an interesting, or funny, or whatever, clip.  Still, though, surfing good never hurts, so try hard!

**First round:**  Top three entrants per quarter move to next round.  Place will be judged on total upvotes per video, downvotes will not be counted.  In the case of obvious gaming of the upvote system, the mods will determine, arbitrarily, the best course of action.  

**REMEMBER:** submit to r/redditsurfoff, upvotes from r/surfing will not be counted towards total.  As such, make sure you let the community know when you post a video.

**Finals:**  Top twelve videos will be viewed by mods, who will then choose the top four.

**PRIZES:**

Quarterly winners- bragging rights, as well as a yet to be designed, special flair.  Probably a crown or something.  I don't know.

Finals-  Winners will choose their prize, with 1st going first, and you can figure it out from there.

**Available Prizes-**

 *A no expense paid trip to the North Shore of Oahu, where you can sleep on Dumbassthenes couch.  That's right, you pay for the ticket and your food while your here, I'll give you a place to stay and show you around the North Shore.  Board may be provided, depending on the size and ability level of the winner.  WARNING:  I will make you surf, even if it's big.  Shit, especially if it's big.

*Various boxes of goodies thrown together by the other mods.  It's a year away, we'll figure out what's in them when the time comes.  Don't expect anything too gnarly, we're all poor.

And that's about it.  **First rounds starts tomorrow, June 1st, and will run until September 1st.**

It is not our board. Also, being that it is stolen, does not mean, the person who we are selling it for, stole it. It could have changed hands 10 times before we got it, which means we have no right no accuse anybody of anything. I know you want your board back right then and there, but then we would be stealing from somebody else. We also cant call the cops to report a stolen board because it is not our board. If we were to call, they would ask to speak with you. Bobby did the right thing in a crummy situation. Also, in regards to looking at the boards in the back for your other stolen boards, just fyi, there are no boards in the back...they get put out front every day. I am sorry this happened, and I hope you get your board back.

So, Surf n Sea is more than happy to sell a board which may be stolen, because, if it is, they don't feel obligated to help you in any way.

Pretty nice racket, I know where I'll go when I decide to develop a meth habit and starting stealing surfboards.

Also, there is a giant room full of used boards upstairs.  I've been in it, it's right past the sign that says ""employees only"".  The majority are high end classic longboards, but there are others mixed in.

1334693822.0	seqyr	Lost my friend, looking for his boards.	Meatball_express	54	2	12	"Reddit is a pretty amazing community and hopefully you all can help. I'll try to keep this brief:

On 9/30/2011 I lost my best friend of 25 years. He was my brother in every sense of the word. We didn't grow up near the ocean, more than an hour away but when we could drive we began surfing. Doing so would change our lives forever. From his love of surfing he began building boards, at first for his friends and then for a broader audience. He shaped under his last name: Trill.

The love of surfing has taken us many places and to different countries. He took a solo trip to California and on his way home the racks he had borrowed from my dad years prior had finally failed and broke. Here is the post he left on [Swaylocks](http://www2.swaylocks.com/node/1013080)

""if anyone happens to come across a few Surfboards by Trill, please post something. long story short...i was returning home to the east coast after a month long tour of CA. i drove 6 hrs. thru a bad coastal storm. my racks broke and blew off my roof w/ the boards at 80 mph. went to buy ratchet straps, by the time i got back the boards were gone. they were in the Mojave Desert almost into AZ. there were three boars: 9'6"" triple stringer, 9'6"" sky blue opague lam, 8'4"" blue swirl deck inlay. just curious to see if they made it to the water instead of some trucker's basement..........thanks""

Needless to say he's been looking for these boards ever since. I know it would mean the world to his family to have these boards returned but I also realize this is probably a one in a million shot.

Now you're getting ready for a one-way freight-train ticket towards the beach to be caught inside for the rest of the set.

What's your technique for avoiding eating it as much as possible?  I just try to bury the nose as deep as I can at a 45 degree angle to the water to try to make a sea anchor and keep myself in the same spot.

If you youtube ""how to duckdive"" or ""duckdiving big surf"" it's videos of people getting under unbroken waves or little ripples of whitewater--stuff you wouldn't even have to get under for if you didn't want to.

Anyone else ever have to deal with this horrible sense of  disappointment?

I was surfing in the Northeast, at my ""home"" break (if you consider home 30 minutes away) and the waves were probably chest-head. But I hadn't been out in at least 3 or 4 months. This was mainly due to a combination of injury, snowboarding, and lack of sunlight. 

Even though I've been swimming a lot lately, all that cold water, 5mm of Rubber, and a relentless beach break completely ruined my day. Anyone have a similar story?

I enjoy redditors coming out to surf with me.  In the last few years I've had more than a few people come to visit, and not once have I been disappointed when it comes to the level of commitment a person has shown. 

Each time I've seen people rise to the occasion, and challenge an ocean that is, generally, much more powerful and intimidating than what they deal with at home.

Yesterday took it to another level.

/u/sosleepysotired hit me up to come surf, and, as I always do, I agreed to show him around.  One downside to the life I live, writing for money, and surfing and diving whenever I want, is that everyone else has real jobs.  They're busy, and I get a little lonely.  So I jump at the chance to have a new friend to fuck around with.  If that's seems kind of needy, well, it is.  This is the life I lead.

It was crazy to find that he was my brother in law's best friend growing up.  He and I went to high school together.  I knew him, though not well.  It's a small world.  Shit like that is crazy.

I've lived on the North Shore long enough to have a serious problem judging wave size.  Suffice to say, it was pretty big.  And all he had was a 6'4.  So that's what he rode.  While I was on a 7'4 semigun, and feeling pretty undergunned on sets.  And, to understate things, he charged.

His board forced him to sit inside, directly in the path of the sets that kept cleaning out the lineup.  The swell was building the entire session, and while I found myself scratching for the horizon to avoid a severe ass beating, he kept getting caught.  And paddling back out after.

I was, and am, impressed.  It was an amazing demonstration of will, strength, and determination.  He earned a ton of my awe, respect, and above all, a friendship I won't soon forget.

You kill it, /u/sosleepysotired.  I'm looking forward to your next visit.

If you can't get up on your 7'0 funboard, then how are you expecting to handle that 5'8 channel islands? Just enjoy learning and progressing naturally. Forcing it never seems to work out for anyone. You get frustrated and blame the waves. If its barely 2 foot, grab a longboard or fish and leave Kelly Slater's board choice out of it. Have fun being a kook for a while and don't worry, your time with that board will come.

Edit:  This is not an attack on longboarders. I love my longboard and surf it in the summer a lot. What I was talking about are people forcing what the pros have, similar to the bicycle example below. No choice is one thing, If that's all you have, go get it! If you paddle out and catch nothing on a name brand and drop names of who rides it, our convo is over.

We've updated the look and feel of pretty much the entire subreddit.  The changes apply to [r/surfing](http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing), the [faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing/faq) page, and the [submit a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing/submit) page.

Love it? Hate it?  Don't give a hoot? 

Let us know what you think.

## The 10,000 ft view

We made quite a few changes, but the list below covers the major ones.

 * Customized the colors, fonts, and menu layouts
 * Added a custom header image
 * Added a custom subreddit image
 * Added a submission advisory
 * Added custom link flair to the submissions
 * Added a footer image - scroll to the bottom
 * Added a sidebar image
   * The sidebar image is something we'd like to cycle based on great subscriber submissions.
 * Added a sticky note
   * The sticky content will probably change from time to time, announcing on-going contests, broadcasts, upcoming AMAs, surveys, etc.  For now make sure you check out the [surf-off](http://www.reddit.com/r/surfing/comments/uf35b/announcing_the_great_reddit_surf_off).

 
## Bugs, oddities and issues

This is the first release so there are bound to be bugs that we missed.  In particular, if the subreddit seems to be rendering oddly/incorrectly on your OS/browser combination, let us know, preferably with an accompanying screenshot and a detailed description of your system configuration.

**Known bugs and rough edges**:

 * The favicon flair for the submitted links are slightly clipped in IE8 and Firefox.
 * The custom 'advisory' image for the submission page is not displayed in IE8.
 * The corners of the sticky note at the top of the page are nicely rounded in Chrome, Firefox and Safari on all platforms, but are square in IE.
 * ~~The alien is frazzled.  The alien is also getting a makeover at the moment.~~
 * ~~The sticky overflows on smartphone browsers.  This seems a bit tricky due to CSS limitations reddit imposes.~~

## A work in progress, a call for contributions

We've come quite a ways, but the customization is still not complete.  We are still on the lookout for artwork/flair for the following items, and user submissions are definitely welcome.  It's cool to pilfer things from the web, but if you do, please also include a link to the original, so we can add a pointer to it in the stylesheet.  No prizes or anything, but if you submit something and it gets adopted, you'll get a shout out in the stylesheet.  And of course you'll be able to bask in the glory of your contribution every time you visit r/surfing.

 * **Up/Down arrow** replacements.  This is the big one.  If you want to contribute something here please consider the following:

   * The default size of the arrows is **15x15 px**.  Anything up to **20x20 px** is probably workable, but the smaller the better.

   * The icons are small, so oblong things like surfboards might be tough from a usability standpoint.

   * If you want to submit arrow replacements, keep in mind that there are ***at least*** 4 states you need to consider: **UpNotClicked**, **UpClicked**, **DownNotClicked**, **DownClicked**.  However the arrows also support a hover state, so we can also use **UpNotClickedHover**, **UpClickedHover**, **DownNotClickedHover**, **DownClickedHover** images.

   * The icons should obviously be related to surfing in some way, and the set should have a coherent theme.

 * **'Submit a link'** button replacements.  Default, and hover versions.

 * **'Create your own community'** button replacements.  Default, and hover versions.

 * **Other.**  Are there other aspects of the site that we can customize but aren't even aware of?  Let us know.

## Credit where credit is due

The great majority of the CSS code as well as most of the images were pilfered from other subreddits or the great wide internet.  Special mentions go out to [r/reddithax](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax), [r/csshelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp), [r/battlefield3](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3), [r/skyrim](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim), [r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness) and [r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees).  Image credits for everything not made by us can be found in the [stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/2944050).  Also see the [stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/2944050) if you are interested in all the gory details, or are a CSS guru and would like to scream and yell at us for our ugly code.

## TLDR;
r/surfing got a makeover.

## Edit:
Welcome to version 2.0.  There is a wave in the header.  The header and footer images should look better on larger monitors.  The sidebar styling is in better agreement with the rest of the page.  The font shouldn't look quite as retarded in RES night mode."	t5_2qmde	True

I haven't asked anyone yet, I figure I'd sound out r/surfing before I brought it up, but I'm sure they'll be willing to do it.  

Here are the dudes that would be easy to get, let me know you're  interested in and I'll see what I can do:

Eric Arakawa- HIC genius

Marcello Vercelli- insanely talented shaper/artist/skater. Google the guy, his roots run crazy deep

Dan Ernest- lesser known but the guy i go to for boards.  A true craftsman who can do every step of board production better than anyone I've ever known.  Makes the best longboards I've ever ridden.

Wade Tokoro- charges Pipe and is the guy who the best surfers in the world turn to for their Hawaii boards.

Kerry Tokoro- Wade's brother, shapes for HIC, makes unreal high performance boards

Yoshi Umeda- Power Drive surfboards, his riders are starting to blow up.

Anyway, these are the easy ones.  Let me know whats up and I'll ask if they're down."	t5_2qmde	True

Mayo clinic developed a new procedure for my specific condition (apical HCM) - without their expertise I would have been looking at a heart transplant. Thank you Mayo Clinic.

Well, Nike decided to pull out of surfing, juice wasn't worth the squeeze so they dumped all of their sponsored surfers.

When something like [this](http://vimeo.com/64759307) comes along, it seems apropos

If it makes you feel any better, I was so caught up in staring at you when we got out of the water that I didn't watch where I was walking, and kicked a rock so hard I think my toe may be broken.

PS - will you tell my wife where you bought that bikini?
