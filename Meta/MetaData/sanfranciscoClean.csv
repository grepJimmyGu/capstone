1341177885.0	vw6os	Saw a girl littering, asked her to pick it up...she said no	agsinger	979	325	1402	"* This was at the intersection of Divis and Hayes at around 1:50pm today. 
* She was with her hipster guy friend sitting in front of Acme Burgers smoking a cigarette outside. 
* They weren't even eating there, just waiting for the bus. 
* She threw her empty package of cigarettes on the ground. 
* I asked her to pick it up, to which she responded no.
*  Her and her friend are both scumbags IMO for blatantly creating garbage that the restaurant owner (and the rest of the community need to clean up).
* When they got up to get on the bus, I called them scumbags in front of everyone (which they are).

The reason is...they need to be named and shamed if we ever hope to change their behavior. If we all ignore the disrespectful behavior we don't ever change the world.

I think I upset my girlfriend for calling others scumbags in public but you know what, they are.  

Think I'm right or wrong?

**TL;DR: girl litters, I asked her to pick it up, she said no, when they got on bus I called them scumbags in front of many people publicly naming / shaming them. Too harsh or not? I think we all need to do this if we ever hope to change things.**"	t5_2qh3u	True

Part of the reason people like Lyft, Uber and other services like that because you have mistreated passangers for years.  Hoe many times have we entered a cab at night and have been refused service because it would take you to the Sunset or the Richmond.

Then today my friend saw two dudes walking down the street matching the descriptions of the attackers. One had scratches on his face that correspond with the attack. Two Hispanic men, between 20-25. One stocky, one lean, one with obvious scratches on his face.

Jack came up the chair lift to meet me &amp; return my cell phone.  I offered him $20 but he refused.  ""This is what is expected of me"" he said.

He said he was an employee at Kaiser and he used to be in the military. He really did seem sincere the entire time and said he would pay the money back. This kid gave him $20 and was all ..uhh do you want my address or something and the man was like oh yeah sure. I texted my friend while this was happening and he said his daughter must fly a lot because he has seen him on BART a couple times before. 

Just thought I'd give everyone a heads up! I also almost gave money to a guy in a business suit outside the Moscone Center. He said someone stole his wallet and he needed money for the CalTrain. Then I noticed he had no teeth and his badge straight up said ""convention member."" This is a pretty popular scam though unlike the other one.

1366381440.0	1coeh7	Tomorrow is 4/20, expect a significant increase in traffic near eastern end of GG Park	pedroah	161	34	97	"From what I've seen the past few years, the eastern end of Golden Gate Park is going to be filled with cars as well as the surrounding neighborhoods.  A big difference this year is that the holiday falls on a Saturday so attendance may be even higher.  Additionally JFK will be closed between 8th Ave and Traverse (just west of the bridge for 19th Ave).  

This means possibly an increase in the number of revellers and a decrease in parking availability inside GG Park.  I anticipate it will cause more overflow into the surrounding neighborhoods. If you live nearby, you may want to keep your car in place after tonight.  I imagine finding parking tomorrow will not be easy.  

Those participating in festivities, strongly consider using other modes of transportation.  

For example Take BART until Powell Street and then take the outbound Muni 5 or 71 bus to Arguello.  The 31 and N lines will also take you within a couple blocks of GG Park.  Exit the bus at Arguello.  The 31, 71, and N will definitely have more capacity than the 5.  The N will likely have the most capacity.  

From the Glen Park BART station the 44 will go to GG Park also.  Get off at Academy of Science or Fulton.

Biking from Downtown SF is easy too, use Wiggle route and it's fairly flat.

tldr: 4/20 is on a Saturday and part of JFK is closed, those living nearby may not want to move your car. Revellers consider using using public transportation"	t5_2qh3u	True

I went out for a few rides this week on account of it being relatively nice weather, and I saw plenty of other cyclists cruising around without helmets, lights, and often even without reflectors. Helmets are your own deal and I'm not going to start that argument, but if you choose to ride without lights, just know that you are effectively not visible to everyone else on the road, including other cyclists. It costs like 20 bucks to get a decent set of front and rear blinkers, and it'll greatly increase your visibility to everyone around you, especially if you're riding on streets without bike lanes. 

This is probably not even worth saying to the smart Reddit crowd, but I was stunned at the number of people riding around after dark without any kind of lights or reflectors this week. "	t5_2qh3u	True

1343430346.0	x9tsn	Muggings in Lower Haight / Castro / Duboce Triangle	GuardYourPhone	141	22	99	"Hey SF Community,

I've never made a self post and, in fact, I created this username for the sole purpose of remaining completely anonymous.  I'm also not one to post anything negative - part of the reason I'm posting is to simply help myself process what happened; and the other part is a genuine desire to help my neighbors not make the same mistake I did.

I was mugged - and beaten - by three guys on Noe and Henry last night around midnight.  They came from behind me and went straight for my phone, which I was carrying in my hand (not in my pocket...I always hold my phone for some reason) - they didn't go for my wallet or keys...just the phone.  I was stupid enough to fight back until the second guy tackled me to the ground.  As I was tug-of-warring with the first guy, the second guy kept kicking my face/head/side/back...and when the third guy joined in, I let the phone go.  They all ran east down Henry.

I continued north on Noe until I got to Duboce Park; I spotted and flagged down a patrol car.  The officer took a statement and then informed me that I was the third victim that night of (allegedly) the same three guys.  This has been happening over the past couple of weeks, apparently.  The other cases last night took place in Lower Haight...and in both cases, just the phones were stolen.  At least a dozen officers eventually showed up (most were undercover)...they had all been out looking for these guys.  And while I know it's not popular on Reddit to like cops, every single damn one of them was incredibly kind and even empathetic.  They could tell I was really shaken - plus there was blood dripping down my face and arms.

Anyway, please just be careful/conscious of your surroundings, and perhaps keep your phones out of sight.  I've lived in some sketchy cities/neighborhoods before and have always prided myself on being prepared to handle a situation like this...but I was absolutely caught off guard.  And just in case: the three guys were black and/or black-Hispanic mix...all were wearing dark sweats/hoodies and baseball caps with the flat brim.  They were around 5'7"" and likely in their teens or early 20s.

1346488269.0	z6etl	San Francisco is pretty sick.		165	45	109	"I live in Orange County and I convinced my family to let us stay in San Francisco for one night on our way to Sacramento. Earlier today I took a walk around the boardwalk smoked a little bit of weed and ate a good sandwich at Boudin's. Then I went back to the hotel, and then left to USF to meet up with my friend. We walked around the panhandle and Golden Gate Park, and I have to say I really like the amount of ""nature"" available, something that LA kind of lacks. We walked around Haight street and I got a burrito at a Mexican place that was pretty good. We walked back to the USF area and my friend had to leave, so I was looking for something to do. I ended up walking around USF's campus and meeting random freshman from the school. I then got picked up by my parents and we went to Chinatown to eat. The food was really good. After that they dropped me off and I met up with another friend at an art show. I gave a guy at the door 5 bucks and went underground into this room with art all over the walls. It had a bar and DJ and a party atmosphere to it all. I had never been to something like this that was literally underground. I got pretty drunk and high and my friend had to leave so I left the art show and walked around to explore. One crazy thing I saw was some drunk guy pissing himself in front of everyone on the sidewalk. Also, when I was walking through an alley I saw someone injecting heroin, which is something I had never seen before. I then got a crepe. Overall I really enjoyed the experience and would consider living here if I had the chance, perhaps pharmacy school at UCSF? The weather is also considerably colder, but that gives people an opportunity to dress up, which I noticed a lot of people did. Oh yeah and the buses attached to the power lines was really cool, not only because it is good for the environment but also because it reminded me of Blade Runner or something.

A dark stretch of road,  btw.

When they noticed me they called out asking me if I had a light for a cigarette or something. I kept walking. As soon as they noticed that I wasn't stopping they started running after me yelling *""give it up, give us your fucking money!""*

Well, I was sober and I had a head start, so I just started running up Castro Street. They chased me, so I finally  ran out into the middle of the street and started hollering very loudly and waving my arms around like an idiot. 

As soon as some headlights came over the hill they stopped chasing me and ran away.

I immediately called 911 and the cops were there within a few minutes. 

PLEASE!   Be careful out there this weekend!   There are a lot of desperate and predatory people out there who WILL be trying to take advantage of the festivities on Castro to rob people or worse!

I had a decent job last year. Wasn't making a ton of money (the $90k was 3 years ago), but I was employed. I got recruited away to SF (from the east coast) to work at a start up in February. The start up just folded and I am kicked out of the corporate rental. My savings are used up. I literally have $60 in my pocket and 2 suitcases full of clothes and crap to my name. 

I rented a Public Storage unit for $1 for the first month and have my stuff in there and sleep there when possible. I spend the day in Starbucks on my NetBook applying for jobs.

I'm a Veteran, so I'm going to contact the VA and see if they have anything, but I thought I'd try Reddit too.

My skill set is in the sales/inside sales/fundraising area. I'll gladly send my resume to anyone who PMs me. 

Please, if you know of anything, let me know.

Edit: I'll also send you the link to my LinkedIn profile. I have 13 written recommendations on there. I am a legitimately awesome salesperson. 

**EDIT 2:** Getting a lot of good advice and specific offers of help. **PLEASE keep them coming.** Even if nothing pans out, I can not adequately express my appreciation. Thank you all very much.

**EDIT 3:** I am overwhelmed by the number of positive, helpful responses, Reddit...I actually had a phone interview with someone tonight...I'll know Wednesday if that opportunity works out.

**EDIT 4:** Good day / Bad day...**the bad:** I got A LOT of rejection emails today. I want to yell ""I didn't even rate an interview for the JUNIOR sales position???"". I'm telling myself I'm over qualified for some of the rejections....Also I got **caught** sleeping in the storage place. Apparently they do rounds. The dude totally freaked out on me. He said I would be reported to the district manager, whatever that means. **The Good:** The guy I phone interviewed with last night followed up on my references today and I got a call from someone else who wants to talk about a position (both of these are from my personal network and would be consulting in the field I've been in for the past few years)...so...kind of a peak and valley day. **I will keep you updated, and I am blown away by the help offered. Thank you, Reddit.**

**EDIT 5:** 1:20pm Friday the 13th...just got off the phone (2nd phone interview) for a job. This would be huge for me. They said they'd give me a Yes/No later tonight. It's going to be a long few hours..."	t5_2qh3u	True

As frustrating as SF can be sometimes it is still where I've chosen to make my home for the last 6 years and as bad as it gets sometimes, there are reasons why I just can't bring myself to leave.

First would be the parks. And I'm not talking bout Dolores. I'm talking about the kind of park where you don't even feel like you're in the City anymore. I had the privilege of calling Golden Gate Park my office all summer, and it really is amazing how far away from the city you can feel without even leaving it's boarders. You look around and it's trees on all sides. I highly recommend getting off the roads in GGP and exploring the trails, you may find something you never knew existed. And GGP is just the beginning. San Francisco is blessed with many amazing natural places. I'm lucky enough to live in the Richmond where I'm surrounded on all sides by amazing places like GGP, Land's End and the Presidio, but there are amazing natural places all over the city, like Glen Canyon, Grand View Park, Corona Heights, McLaren Park and many, many others.

Second would be the food. I'm ashamed of how often I eat out, especially when my budget is so small, but damn if there aren't amazing little eateries hidden in every nook and cranny in this city, and damn if it isn't my mission to one day eat at every last one. One of the factors in our apartment hunting is how far it is from our favorite eatery. And the thought of leaving the city and saying good bye to that place, well, it just breaks my heart.

Third, believe it or not, is Muni. I'll be the first to complain about Muni and their many, many shortcomings, but compared to some of the cities I've visited Muni is a well-oiled machine. I dare any of you to try taking public transit in Miami after midnight. One of the scariest nights of my life. I come from Santa Rosa, where buses stop at like, 7:30, so good luck getting home from the bars without a DD. I recently got back from Portland, which really does have most of their shit figured out in ways SF does not, but their transit system can be confusing as hell sometimes. Every time I travel I long for the simplicity and the overall extensive coverage of Muni.

Fourth is the people. Sure SF has it's fair share of douchebags, snobs, bros, hoes and hipsters, but I've always made my living here by working for the community and the reason is most of the people in SF are pretty damn cool. With so many people coming and going, and housing being what it is, it can be hard to maintain that neighborhood feel in our town, so kudos to those that go out of their way to meet their neighbors, get together at their cafes, support their local businesses and work to make this place what it is. I wouldn't be here without those people. 

So, when life's got ya down, and it feels like the whole city is against you, and you dream about life elsewhere, what about SF makes you want to stay?"	t5_2qh3u	True

This has never happened before!  I don't really remember what exactly happened but I hit my head pretty badly, they had to stop the train, and carry me out to an ambulance.  Before the paramedics arrived, I was helped by some very kind people, some of whom I didn't get to thank enough.

1) Lilly (the only name I caught) the chef.  You were the first person I remember as I regained consciousness and you were incredibly nice.  You gave me some of your juice, talked to me and explained what had just happened, and basically stopped me from freaking out.  Thank you so much.  Hope I didn't make you too late for class...

2) A blonde haired woman with her baby and husband.  I didn't catch your name.  You said you were going into the city for site-seeing.  You stayed even when I said you didn't have to anymore, you talked to me about a similar incident with your husband that made me feel better, and gave me an almond bar to eat.  Thanks so much.

3) A large, middle-aged, African American man...didn't catch his name either.  Before I even knew what was happening, you positioned me on the ground and used your laptop bag to elevate my feet.  When I started to feel better I offered it back, and you told me it was fine and to rest up.  Super nice dude.  Thanks.

4) Some other girl with dark hair who I think seemed cute (I was on the ground with blurred vision and was looking at her upside-down so this is the best description I can give...) offered me her bottle of water.  Thanks.


That's about it.  Nothing really serious was wrong with me; my head still kills.   I probably just took a weird mixture of cold and allergy medications that didn't like each other that morning, and then didn't eat breakfast.  I felt really stupid for holding everyone up, but these people made me feel okay about it.

1373641326.0	1i5mne	Why I'll never take a cab again	altum	145	46	193	"Last night I got in a cab for a quick ride up back to my apartment, it was up hill and I didn't want to walk.  The ride was short, only a $4 or so fare.  When I got to my building, the cab driver says,  you have cash right? 

Well, I didn't, and I offered to pay him extra to cover the credit card fees. Nope, somehow his credit card machine was magically broken.  I called my roommates, no one picked up. So I called a friend that lived near by to come with some cash so I could pay this guy off.  Well during this time, he kept the meter running so I knew by the time my friend got to me, the fare would've jumped to something like $30.

So I tell him, fuck it, take me to the chase bank on california. While driving, this guy starts adjusting his pants, obviously showing me he has a gun. Tell my friend to meet me there with some money. 

So I get out at the bank, the fare is now $12, and I'm seriously considering just running but I'm not faster than a bullet. Pull out a $20. At this point, my friend shows up with $13 for me, and I go to give that to the driver.  Magically the fare is now $14.  Wow. So I give him the 20 and he speeds off.

Cab drivers wonder why they're losing business to the likes of sidecar and lyft and uber. No fucking wonder when you have guys like him basically holding people hostage because they don't have cash. What the fuck. Fuck them.

1318485874.0	lajgo	The Cab Situation in San Francisco is Ridiculous	gengengis	124	25	162	"First, let's state the obvious: it's tough to get a cab in the City.  There are ~1,300 cabs for a population of 800,000, and a daytime population of ~2,000,000.  At 49 square miles, the City is small and compact, and the average person is much more apt to not own a car, and rely on cabs, public transit, and walking.

So there's that.  And that's MTA's fault.  We have an artificial monopoly setup by the government to limit the number of cabs, thus increasing the average wage earned by cab drivers.  And to some extent, that's understandable.  San Francisco is an expensive place to live.  Without that monopoly, we've basically forced cab drivers in the City to live somewhere else.

I don't want to make broad, sweeping generalizations.  But some of the cab drivers in this city are just horrendous.  I'm constantly asked where I'm going before I get in a cab.  This is very clearly prohibited.  From the MTA regulations:

 &gt;  (e)     Driver Duties During Shift.

&gt;   (1)     A Driver shall not refuse, or direct or permit the refusal, of prospective passengers in any place within the City for transportation to any other place in the City, or to or from the San Francisco International Airport, or to the Oakland International Airport, or paratransit passengers within the Paratransit Program service area, at rates authorized by law, if the prospective passengers present themselves for transportation in a clean, coherent, safe and orderly manner and for a lawful purpose and the Driver has sufficient time before the end of his or her shift.


This is a perfectly natural regulation.  If we're going to create an artificial monopoly, destroying the free market, specifically to raise fares &amp; rides for the benefit of the drivers, it makes sense that the cab drivers enjoying the benefit of the artificial monopoly be forced to follow some simple rules.  The base fare is there for a reason.  Any time you enter the cab, even if I'm going a block, the driver is guaranteed $3.50.

This past week, while it was raining, I was waiting for a cab home.  I have no rain jacket, as I frequently let myself be tricked by San Francisco weather, and I'm sitting in the rain soaked.  After maybe 15-20 minutes, my friend and I get a cab.  The cab driver stops, and asks that frequent question: ""where are you going?""

Okay, I know this ploy, so I tell him my friend's address.  It's furthest, and about a $15 cab ride.  My house is much closer, about $6, but directly on the route.  I'm on Sutter, he's on Pine.  It's on the way.

So we get in the cab, and I say, ""actually, sorry, could we make two stops?  The first one is XXX and on the way.""

Immediately slam on the breaks.  I'll only make one stop!  Arguments ensure.  We're told to ""get the fuck out of the cab, etc.""  Guy is a complete dick, immediately hostile for no reason.  I flick him off as he leaves, and he spits out the window at me.

Let's quote again from MTA regulations:

&gt; (9)     Except as prohibited by the rules of the Paratransit Program, a Driver may transport two or more passengers who voluntarily agree to split the fare between them. The passengers may by mutual agreement split the fare according to any formula; however, regardless of any mutual agreement of the passengers, the Driver shall not collect from all combined passenger payments in any amount in excess of the fare shown on the Taximeter at the time that the last passenger reaches their destination.

This is an extreme situation.  But I'm just so sick and tired of being asked where I'm going, having drivers speed off after I tell them.  They can't have it both ways.  Either they shut the fuck up, give up their monopoly, allow this city to have a natural level of cabs, or they take us where ever we want to go within the city limits.

This rant has grown long.  But the credit card situation also annoys me.

I don't always have cash.  I know that MTA is now charging cab drivers 5% on any credit card charge.  I always tip at least 20%.  So, please, just take the card.

I recently had a guy claim there was a $10 minimum on credit charges.  Of course there's no $10 minimum.  Just take the card and the 20% tip and quit being so hostile.

TL;DR I fucking hate about 30% of the cab drivers in San Francisco, for various reasons.  The rest are very nice.  Uber Cab is the best thing ever invented."	t5_2qh3u	True

(my list so far)	gonzoblair	110	16	132	"**This list is my ongoing attempt to keep track of the most fun and tasty spots around the city that I've discovered in my trek so far. Always looking to expand and discover something new.**

* Sheba Piano Lounge - Went here with friends... great little nightspot that serves Ethiopian food and cocktails in an candle lit upscale piano lounge on Fillmore. A very cool spot for pretending you're classy if you also don't mind eating with your hands. http://shebapianolounge.com/

* Tony's Pizza Napoletana - This one wins a lot of awards is considered by some to be the best damn pizza in the world and I think they might be right. Some great pizza dishes every time we go here it seems to impress. Expect to wait about an hour for a table on a busy night and about as long in line for the bathroom. http://www.tonyspizzanapoletana.com/

* Benu - Haven't been here yet but it's getting insane praise from the Wall Street Journal: ""Benu, a year-old San Francisco effort from Thomas Keller's former right-hand man Corey Lee (he was chef du cuisine at the French Laundry), has captured the imaginations of his fellow chefs. ""Benu really is the best restaurant in America,"" said chef David Chang.""
Place is expensive as these type of elite dining things tend to be. http://benusf.com/

* Forbidden Island Tiki Lounge - A retro polynesian tropical themed lounge in Alameda that serves crazy flaming tiki cocktails, shame about the remote location. Guess you need a DD or $50 cab ride to hit this one.  http://www.forbiddenislandalameda.com/

* Deli Board - Fantastic sandwich shop in SOMA that serves up tasty creations and has a really enthusiastic staff and chef. They are really into making sandwiches. So if you like sandwiches you should go here.
http://www.deliboardsf.com/

* Tadich Grill - Haven't been to this one yet but it was highly recommended by both Anthony Bourdain and the older cab driver who drove me to Rickhouse last night so that's good enough for me.
http://www.tadichgrill.com/

* Smuggler's Cove - Finally a tiki bar accessible by BART. The current favorite tiki bar in the city where it's all spectacle and fruity drinks. Also features a drinking bingo game that seems to earn only respect and alcohol poisoning.http://smugglerscovesf.com/trapdoor/

* Puerto Alegre - This Mission Mexican place is great for giant burritos and pitchers of margaritas. The place is crowded and often crawling with hipsters, but worth the stretch. Also dangerous is the flight of tequila. They're not fooling around.
http://www.allmenus.com/ca/san-francisco/157995-puerto-alegre/menu/

* Zam Zam - Awesome very old school dive martini bar in Haight.  Bartenders are not the warmest people but really... that's how it should be.

* The Slanted Door - Solid upscale dining experience on the Ferry Building water view overlooking the Bay Bridge. Its good if youre looking for a high end type restaurant. http://www.slanteddoor.com/

* R&amp;G Lounge - A big sprawling Chinatown dining spot with cocktails, martinis, and enormous portions of whole fried crab. Always have a great time here. It's also right around the corner from the bar, Buddha Lounge. http://rnglounge.com/ 

* Incanto - Noe Valley dining spot apparently known for unusual meat dishes. Most notable is the 3 course Leg of Beast group dining experience...http://incanto.biz/2010/10/23/leg-of-beast-dinin/

* Zeitgeist - Legendary Mission dive bar where every drink is a double and everyone is outside in the beer garden drinking and smoking weed. Also legendary are the attitudes of the bartenders. Considered the meanest in the city, but hey the place is great. Food options aren't bad either, they got a grill for burgers and the charming Tamale Lady who makes the rounds. http://zeitgeistsf.com/

* Pasión - A Peruvian dining spot in the Inner Sunset where you can find a lot of really tasty dishes and cocktails. The presentation is really sharp and artistic here, especially on the Pescado a lo Macho dish. It's a whole entire fried dorade fish wrapped around clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, calamari, cilantro rice covered in sauce.
http://pasionsf.com/menus/index.html

* Andalu - Great Mission tapas place for brunch, pitchers of cocktails, and evening group dining with a 10 course prix fix menu that's fantastic.http://www.andalusf.com/menu_group.html

* Cliff House brunch - Since 'Home' is gone this is currently my favorite brunch spot in the city. A high class dining room buffet with a gorgeous view overlooking the sea side and really terrific dishes. Oh and they have a lady playing the harp so you get to feel very 1%.

* Zero Zero - A SOMA restaurant that specializes in pizza. They even do a terrific brunch pizza with eggs, sausage and fixings. The desert here is also incredible and fattening as hell.

* Picaro -  A fun group spot for tapas and sangria in The Mission that always serves tasty dishes.

* Fondue Cowboy - newly opened SOMA fondue spot on Folsom that serves incredible gourmet but reasonably priced fondue dishes and amazing deserts of dipping foods and chocolate. Reservations are sometimes tough but whatever.http://www.fonduecowboy.com/Fondue_Cowboy/Home.html

* Foreign Cinema - Well known Mission restaurant with well conceived dishes and a great outdoor/theater type dining experience as well as some great cocktails.http://foreigncinema.com/

* Pork Store - Most people know this place on 16th &amp; Valencia for its popular brunch, but it's actually a cool late night dining spot with a strange double menu of American diner food and Mediterranean. They also have hookahs and it's sort of attached like a Siamese twin to a higher end restaurant on the side. 
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45199169/porkstorecafe/Pork_Store/porkstorecafe.html

* SupperClub - Only been here for the shows and the club part... which is always fun and kind of like one of those weird night spots that only seem to exist in LA and movies... but the dining part looks great too. http://www.supperclub.com/html/sanfrancisco/food-drinks/food/

* Schroeder's - A goofy German Restaurant and beer hall downtown that offers beer in a giant boot, Polka, and classic bratwurst. Always great for groups.http://www.schroederssf.com/

* Tonga Room - Retro 40's era type dining room that serves tropical cocktails and pricier Polynesian cuisine in a giant Tiki room with a big pool in the middle where a band on a boat plays and every so often a thunderstorm rains down.

* Savoy Tivoli - One of the better North Beach bars with a kind of outdoor open patio, jazz on the weekends, and plenty of fun crowds.

* Sam's in Tiburon - A great brunch spot overlooking the water and out onto the city. Best reached by ferry and perfect for a long Sunday morning Bloody Mary's and food.

* Horizons -  Another great sunny brunch spot on the ocean, this one in Sausalito. Pricey but usually worth it if you're entertaining out of town guests.

* Bourbon &amp; Branch - A fun upper scale bar that focuses hard on whiskey drinks and an exclusive classy style. One of the rare bars that requires reservations. The only downside is the location in the Tenderloin. Go outside for a smoke and meet your local meth addict.http://www.bourbonandbranch.com/

* Pizza Orgasmica -  2 locations in Inner Richmond and North Beach. Not only is the pizza really good and full of filthy sexual double double entendres but they will also serve your entire table beer in a giant 7 pint bong. They call it a ""tower"" but they're not fooling anyone. Stay classy SF.http://www.pizzaorgasmica.com/

* Rickhouse - A great pirate cellar themed bar that has bartenders with weird wax curled mustaches and curious facial hair that is most notable for serving cocktails in a gigantic punch bowl. Went there again last night  always an epic adventure. http://www.rickhousesf.com/"	t5_2qh3u	True
1322035429.0	mmiyh	reddit Thanksgiving, Thursday Nov, 24th, 3:00pm	alukima	107	14	13	"Thursday I'm holding an open Thanksgiving at 3pm. I'm providing two turkeys, potatoes, stuffing, and pies. I ask that you bring an item, $5, and whatever you plan to drink. The address is listed in the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/SFredditors) but you can also PM me for it. If you don't see this until Thursday I suggest just joining the group and finding the Thanksgiving meetup thread. Sorry about the address scavenger hunt but I recently had an issue with people misusing the information I've provided online for meetups. 

Last year people came and went all night so even though it starts at three it will run much later. 

If you can't afford the $5 it's not a big deal. Just help do dishes or take out trash. 



List of item we still need:

A baked side or dessert.
Plastic cups. 
Plastic knives, spoons, forks. 
Folding chairs of any type. 
Ice. 

Also, I have two dogs, if you are allergic to them let me know when I buzz you in and they will be banished to the bedroom.

1358947628.0	174cj9	GOOD vs. BAD ways to strengthen houses to resist Earthquakes	ThorOfTheMountains	105	14	28	"I'm a structural engineer who crawls under houses to evaluate them for earthquake safety.  Many of them have had some earthquake ""retrofit"" work done in the past.  Sadly, the work done in many of these houses will not help protect them from earthquake damage.

BASIC POINTS about Earthquakes:

1.  Damage is &lt;edit&gt; **typically** &lt;/edit&gt; caused from SIDE-to-SIDE motion---not up-and-down.  If you see steel straps or hardware attached to posts or wall 'studs' under you house and nothing else in the way of retrofit strengthening, you probably need more work done.

2.  Plywood should be used to brace the ""cripple-walls"" below the first floor of your house.  The plywood MUST be nailed along ALL sides of every piece.  In many Bay Area houses, special detailing is needed along the bottom edge to connect it properly.

3.  The ""mudsill"" (bottom piece of wood that connects to the foundation) needs to have large square steel ""plate washers"" installed under the nuts that secure the foundation anchor bolts.

4.  Special methods are usually required for houses on steep hillsides, living spaces above garages, and ""non-standard"" original construction.

I co-wrote a 30-page document on retrofit basics available for free download at:  [www.quakecheck.org](http://www.quakecheck.org).  This document covers the above and lots more, with plenty of photos of both good and bad examples.

Californians seem to think that we have learned proper earthquake-preparedness measures simply by virtue of living here--I'm concerned that the next earthquake will show otherwise.

**TL; DR:   Sorry, no TL;DR--this requires serious study.  OR:  Move to Wisconsin?**

Edit:  Wordsmithing.  Originally composed too early in the morning.

Edit #2:  I'm going to a FEMA sponsored workshop tomorrow, and this is on my mind.  FEMA and the Calif. Earthquake Authority have been working on guidelines for strengthening homes, but so far they have not made the first item above clear--which has led to lots of ineffective hardware being installed.

Last week I evaluated a house that had strengthening work installed last July.  It was inadequate in several ways, to the point that it needs to be completely redone.

1353524880.0	13kvr8	Reddit Orphan Thanksgiving - Thursday, November 22, 2012 3pm	culdesaclamort	105	17	15	"For the past two years, my awesome friend Amy hosts an open Thanksgiving. Anyone who needs a place to eat dinner and/or hangout on Thanksgiving is welcome to come. In past years the estimated turnout has been 50-70 people and was becoming a bit much for her tiny apartment to handle so our friend JP has volunteered to let us host at his place.
We start at 3pm and play boardgames, watch football, drink and just generally get to know each other. Last year we had at least three turkeys and a ham. It was amazing. One of the turkeys was wrapped in bacon, or maybe it was the ham.

Dinner is normally ready around 6-7pm. On the menu this year: Three Turkeys, a ham, stuffing, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, gravy, three different types of rolls, sweet potatoes, cornbread, cranberries, mac and cheese, apple pie and pumpkin pie.
After dinner we play games, drink, drink, play more games and just have a great time.

The first year we tried to make this a potluck, and not very many people brought anything. We pretty much only had the basics and we ran out of food. Last year, the second year, I asked for a donation or a side. I got around $40 in donations and so many pies that I was sending frozen pies home with people for weeks. But an overwhelming amount of people did not donate or bring anything. 

So this year to RSVP you have three options:

* Donate: dinner costs between $4-7 each person https://www.wepay.com/donations/orphan-thanksgiving

* Bring something: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApEgrm4a2vnSdElKS1NQUHZoWXB4MnRhcWtnRHhsVFE

* Email Amy and let her know that you want to come but can't donate or bring anything: Amylukima@gmail.com

Here's mine: A friend of mine lived in a haunted house in Hayes Valley with one roommate (both girls). They'd frequently come home and find random objects aligned in height order, picture frames askew, things missing and moved to weird spots (behind the toilet, for example). They both suspected it was the other person playing pranks.

1321234116.0	mbadb	Three UC Berkeley faculty members have written an open letter to the campus administration — which already has over 500 signatures — condemning the police’s use of violence at Wednesday’s protest.	nukestudent	99	15	12	"November 11, 2011

Open Letter to Chancellor Birgeneau, the UC Berkeley administration, and the UC Regents:

We, the undersigned faculty, lecturers, and graduate student assistants—all of whom teach at Berkeley and are invested in the educational mission of this university—are outraged by the unnecessary and excessive use of violence by the police and sheriff’s deputies against peaceful protesters at UC Berkeley beginning on Wednesday, November 9, 2011.

We will not tolerate this assault on the historic legacy of free speech on this campus.

The protests on Sproul Plaza on November 9 were organized by a coalition of undergraduates, graduates, faculty, union members, and staff to clearly articulate links between the privatization of the university, the global financial crisis, the burdens of student debt, and the composition and power of the UC Regents, whose actions demonstrate a lack of concern with sustaining the public character of the UC system. The principles of these protests reach well beyond the Berkeley campus.

After a large demonstration at Sproul and a march into the city of Berkeley, the protesters formed a General Assembly that called for a non-violent encampment under the name Occupy Cal. As the encampment was being established, protesters were immediately met with physical violence by the police, including the jabbing and striking of students and others with batons. This assault by UCPD and Alameda County riot police against those peacefully assembled led to the forcible arrests of 39 protesters and one faculty member. Associate Professor Celeste Langan offered her wrist to the police in surrender, saying “arrest me, arrest me,” but was nevertheless aggressively pulled by her hair to the ground and cuffed. This began a series of tense confrontations—punctuated by further police violence—that lasted throughout the night and has persisted on our campus. The spectacle of police brutalizing members of our community does inestimable damage to our integrity, our reputation, and our standing as a public university.

We are appalled by the Chancellor’s account, in his November 10 “Message to the Campus Community,” that the police were “forced to use their batons.” We strenuously object to the charge that protesters—by linking arms and refusing to disperse—engaged in a form of “violence” directed at law enforcement. The protests did not justify the overwhelming use of force and severe bodily assault by heavily armed officers and deputies. Widely-circulated documentation from videos, photographs, and TV news outlets make plainly evident the squad tactics and individual actions of members of the UCPD and Alameda County Sheriff’s Department. This sends a message to the world that UC Berkeley faculty, staff, and student protesters are regarded on their own campus with suspicion and hostility rather than treated as participants in civil society.

We call on the Berkeley administration to immediately put an end to these grotesquely out-scale police responses to peaceful protest. We insist that the administration abandon the premise that the rigid, armed enforcement of a campus regulation, in circumstances lacking any immediate threat to safety, justifies the precipitious use of force.

We call upon the Chancellor to comply fully and in a timely manner with the Public Record Act request made in writing by the ACLU on November 10. We also call upon the Chancellor to initiate an independent investigation, separate from that to be undertaken by the campus Police Review Board, to ensure a fair review of events and procedures to prevent such attacks on free speech from happening in the future.

We also express our concern with the repressive policing that has occurred around the wider Occupy Wall Street movement—including Occupy Oakland, where undue force has led to numerous injuries such as those sustained by Iraq veteran Scott Olson. In solidarity with Occupy Cal and the Occupy movements around the country, we condemn these police acts unequivocally.

We call for greater attention to the substantive issues raised at the protests on November 9 regarding the privatization of education. With massive cuts in state funding and rising tuition costs across the community college system, the Cal State network, K-12, and the University of California, public education is undergoing a severe divestment. Student debt has reached unprecedented levels as bank profits swell. We decry the growing privatization and tuition increases that are currently heavily promoted by the corporate UC Board of Regents.

We express NO CONFIDENCE in the Regents, who have failed in their responsibility to fight for state funding for public education, and have placed the burden of the budget crisis on the backs of students.

We express NO CONFIDENCE in the willingness of the Chancellor, and other leaders of the UC Berkeley administration, to respond appropriately to student protests, to secure student welfare, and to respect freedom of speech and assembly on the Berkeley campus.

If you're moving out for the first time (which we'll assume you are) then you need to accquaint yourself with the various neighborhoods. (You can also get to know the [districts](http://www.sfresidence.com/aboutsf.htm) but that's not necessary if you're renting). Where you should look depends on where you want to live, how much you can afford, and what kind of area you're looking for -- which is why you'll notice a blend in the various links below. 

Another very important aspect to keep in mind is that SF has various microclimates which you can read about on the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco#Climate) page.

1304046931.0	gzuus	PSA: Do not put your bike on MUNI without keeping an eye on it. 	alukima	85	7	49	"When I was getting on the 21-Hayes today the driver told me they've had a rash of bikes being stolen from the front of buses. Since I rarely use MUNI to transport my bike I sat near the front to watch it. And of course at 7th and Market I see a guy go to the front of the bus and eye the driver who is busy with cash customers. He then tries to yank my bike from the rack. I started screaming and running to the front of the bus and the driver started to honk. Instead of running off the guy kept trying to get the bike off the rack. Luckily for me the arm that goes over the bike wheel got stuck. But the guy still didn't give up there. After I was all the way up to him he said ""I was just playing"" and tried to board the bus for free. 

I had my U-lock going frame to wheel but from the way he was trying to pick it up his intentions were to run off with it, not ride it away. 

I've heard of bikes being stolen from buses before but dismissed it as a rumor or rarity. Clearly this is not the case. 

The few other times I've used MUNI to transport my bike I'd watch it but not as closely. If the arm on the bus wasn't broken my bike would have been gone in seconds. "	t5_2qh3u	True

So while walking my dog this morning near Edna and Flood I found [this little guy](http://imgur.com/a/EFX1Y) hiding under a car. If you recognize him or know him please PM me. I really want to get him back to his owner. 

He wasn't wearing a collar and he doesn't have an ID tag in him (we took him to the Ocean Ave Vet and they scanned him). My wife and I have decided to hold on to him for the next few weeks instead of taking him to the SPCA. 

If anyone know's anything about this dog **please** PM me. 

Thanks,
ThaUniversal

UPDATE: My wife and I hung up a bunch of posters in the neighborhood and the owners saw them and just came by to pick up Bingo. If you live in the Sunnyside neighborhood and see any posters about the found dog please feel free to take them down. Thank you to all who responded.

Carmelina's in the UCSF Parnassus food court has burritos for $4.95.  There is also a Panda Express there where you get three entrees for ~7$.  They give you a ton of food so this is more like two meals for $3.50

Various places in the city will sell Bahn Mi (viet sandwiches) for ~4$.  They aren't very filling though so this is only good if you also have some other snacks on hand.

Greasy Chinese takeout is in the inner richmond.  You can get a plate of food for like $4.35 but I always feel kinda gross after eating this. 

It's pretty easy to find 2.50$ tacos, but again they aren't very filling, even if you get two. 

Chinese bakery pork buns are about $1 each.  Stuff your face with four of them.

My name’s Elizabeth Tobey, and I head up Community at 2K Games. On Tuesday, December 6th at 2 PM, I’d like to invite eight of you to come up (in style no less — limo to be provided) to the 2K Games headquarters in Novato (about half an hour north of San Francisco) to check out an unrevealed segment of our upcoming shooter, The Darkness II. You’ll also get to meet some of the reddit admins and spend some time with the famous kemitche who will be joining you all for the trip.

Since space to this event is limited, we thought that the best way to choose would be by community consensus. If you would like to go and are certain you can make the time (please use your best judgment), please post in the comments below. At 12 noon PT on December 2nd, we will sort the comments by ""best"" and invite the top eight parent comments. 

And while I can’t tell you exactly what you’ll be playing, I can tell you some details about the day: At 2 PM, we’ll be picking up the crew at reddit, Inc headquarters in SOMA to transport you up to our offices. At the offices, you'll be able to meet some of the folks behind the game, play the game, and take pictures with the crew. Producers from the dev team will be on hand to answer everything we possibly can. After the play session, we’ll be taking you back to the city for dinner in a restaurant very much in the style of the one Jackie Estacado frequents – and then back to reddit, Inc. headquarters for everyone to return home.

I’ll be on hand in this thread until December 6th to answer any questions you might have (as well as afterward, in case the play session sparks more questions!)

Thanks to everyone at reddit and in this community for giving us this opportunity.

-e.


Edit: Just wanted to let people know that we'll be selecting people based on up votes and discounting down votes that have been cast to rank other comments up. Only seems fair! 

Second Edit: We have our lucky VIPs! Crongrats to soldierscuzzy, pov_dave, mewmewkitty, greenrock, kemitche, RyogaXenoVee, xthrashx, and oasiss. You'll be receiving a PM from the reddit staff soon and will need to RSVP by Sunday evening to confirm your spot (and in case someone can't make it, we'll be contacting alternates - so stay tuned!) 

Thanks again to everyone - this has been an awesome experience and I can't wait to see what you guys think of the game.

So they caught the guy.

The SF Police actually took this much more seriously than I would have expected. They sent two officers with cameras to collect evidence. They took my security camera footage that I posted in the original link and it seems that he is a repeat offender so they eventually figured out who he was. The actual arrest took a long time (over a month) from when the officer told me they found him. Since then he's been in jail awaiting trial and sentencing. The officer told me that he is unemployed with a drug problem and mostly living on the street and that I probably wouldn't get any restitution from him. I've now learned that he pleaded guilty, so I didn't need to go to court, and he is being sentenced on the 16th of this month. 

Over the past few months I've spent many hrs filing out paper work, dealing with the police, district attorneys office, victims services, insurance companies, etc. It's been quite a drain. I almost wish he wasn't caught. My insurance company has since dropped my homeowners insurance due to my one and only claim for the stolen bike (is this even legal?). The number of people involved in the stealing of a single bike and the man hrs is incredible. The court even took out a restraining order against him on my behalf, I know because I received notification of it in the mail. 

Anyway, I have a decision to make. As part of his sentencing will be parole in which he will be forced to work. I can request restitution in which a portion of his pay check will go to me until I am fully paid back. The part that bothers me is I have no ability to get in touch with the dude and hear his story. I feel bad requesting restitution before having all the facts. From the facts I do have, though, it would seem he doesn't deserve much sympathy. 

So reddit, should I request restitution? Should I potentially make his rehabilitation that much harder? Or would making him pay me back help in his rehabilitation by making him understand the effects of his actions?

tl;dr They caught the guy who stole my bike in April. He pleaded guilty and is going to jail. Should I request restitution?"	t5_2qh3u	True

1310493470.0	inm2l	Dear Reddit, I would like to understand if I did something wrong?	SanFranCommuter	83	12	91	"Dear Reddit, 
I am new here, so maybe I am completely wrong in my reaction, I would like to understand. So here is the story, I live in a 3 apartment building and I have a parking spot. I use my car to go to the Caltrain station. But 3 times in the last three months, I have found cars parked on my driveway in the morning. Not just on the main street blocking a part of the driveway , but actually parked on the sidewalk blocking my driveway. 2 times it turned out to be friends of  neighbor 1 (neighbor 2 saw me complain about this too and seemed sympathetic). I missed my train as I tried to figure out who it was.This morning again car in driveway, turned out it wasn't neighbor 1 when I woke them up. I did not try and wake neighbor 2 up, I knocked once ( It was 7:30 am I know they sleep late so since the chances of it being there car were slim I did not wake them up). I then activated the car alarm so that if the person was around he could come get his car. Checked to see if a note was on the car. No. Finally, around 8:30 am, I called parking enforcement and got the car towed. I missed work as I couldnt get to my car out till 10:10 am. Turned out it was neighbor 2. It was her friend, who parked the car there ALL NIGHT and 'accidentally' fell asleep. She has been messaging me constantly about how much it will cost them and how angry she is, without apologizing to me even once. I feel like I am in another world? She parked there overnight blocking my entire driveway and sidewalk, I could barely squeeze by. She did not leave a note and did not wake up when the car alarm went off. This is entirely her fault according to me. But maybe I did something non-neighborly? Did I perhaps overreact? Should I have done something else? I just thought the towing would happen quickly and I could get to work. It took the towing guy 1 hour to figure out how to tow the car without damaging the car it was wedged so tightly. So reddit, please give me some perspective.

TL;DR Got someone's  car towed, said someone is very angry while I think I was the one wronged since I missed work because they parked in my driveway. Did I over react?

EDIT 1: She just send me a message to tell me to pay for her towing! OMg I feel like crying, why are people so weird?

EDIT 2: Thanks everyone. I feel more in control now, I had started feeling very guilty and thought I was wrong. But now I know that the situation is unfortunate but I did not do anything wrong. Thanks again everyone! 

EDIT 3: I know I am repeating this, but thank you guys. This entire thing really upset me but you all are awesome. I don't think I should post a picture of the neighbor, but here is a picture of how I found my driveway this morning ( I hope I don't get into trouble for this :-)) [Picture](http://imgur.com/ILzNp)

Final Update: Yay! I am over the stupid woman's actions. I emailed the landlord to tell them about what happened like some of you suggested. The landlord called and and told me I was completely right and that the neighbor 2 is crazy (wish she had told me this before!). She also said that if I ever feel threatened call the police and her. And finally also told me that if things get worse I should let her know and she will send neighbor 2 a strongly worded official notice about where to park her guest's car. Apart from this one incident I have loved living here. Some of you wanted to know why I do not bike to caltrain. I am getting my feet wet riding around the city. Riding on Ceser Chavez feels scary to me now but biking to caltrain everyday is definitely a goal. I did not even think about taking BART yesterday. And finally, thanks for welcoming me to the city you all.

And have been ""on the street"" for about 18 hours a day (until I'm sure the office building is empty then I sneak in late and night and sneak out in the morning).

Edit; here's the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/h7o60/anyone_in_san_francisco_hiring_i_just_becamecant/

Anyway, the outpouring from the San Francisco Reddit was freaking amazing and heartwarming. I had job offers (even one I wasn't qualified for, ha!), a TON of ""I'll pass your info along to my buddy"" offers, a lot of heads ups about places that were hiring and one Redditor offered to let me hang out at their place, shower and drink a beer. You guys are fucking awesome.

I was also hitting up my own network and after a 2nd phone interview this week - I was just offered a job. Like, no shit, 5 minutes ago. Not only is it a job in my field, it's a fairly sought after position and the networking opportunities will be extraordinary.

Not only that, but it pays more base salary than any job I've ever had, ever. With performance bonuses, I may make more total than I've ever made. They want me to start ASAP.

I want to give Reddit a big assed, tight, squeeze hug for being there for me when I needed it. 

The bittersweet part: The job is on the East Coast (they're even buying me a plane ticket!). It's a year and a half long consulting gig, BUT when it's over, I'm moving back to SF...I had already decided I liked it more than any other city I've lived and knowing there are people like you guys here makes me feel that much more confident that the Bay Area is a place where I could put down some roots.

**ALSO**, does anyone want to buy a Canon 40d with lens? I don't even have enough money to take BART to the airport and need cash bad. The Pawn Shop said they'd give me $125 for it, if a Redditor can beat that, it's yours. **EDIT - Camera is sold. Supposed to be picked up tomorrow. If it isn't I'll PM the people who have expressed interest.**

Reddit: Thank you more than I can possibly express. 

**tl;dr: Reddit helped me out when I was at my lowest - just got a job offer for more than I've ever made.**"	t5_2qh3u	True

Yesterday a lifetime of music was taken from me. A collection that has taken me in excess of 10 years. It also contained an unfinished collection of remixes and original tracks. Two bags were stolen and my back ups were in the other bag.

It won't cost you anything to share this photo but it would be priceless to me if it was returned. I have no finacial interest in the laptop, I just want the hard drive back. Reward ready and waiting.

Please share. Even if you've never been to the States. Post on any forum, group or mailing group you are on.

(Yes we've submitted to Squid List, SF.Fun.Cheap, SF Weekly, Yelp, etc)
The tragedy is it's a great show with some seriously talented people (comedians &amp; indie rock) and I'm afraid we're going to have a dismal turnout. So what I'm asking from you guys is to come out and spend some time with us. 

We'll do a two-for-one discount if you say 'Reddit' at the door. Even hang out after if you're not too tired.

I'm just really proud of this show and want like-minded people to experience it.

We got written up by SF Weekly a few months ago - http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2011/02/la_sucks_well_except_for_those.php

1352493819.0	12xja7	A long shot: anyone flying from Raleigh to the Bay Area during the next couple of months who could carry-on a rescue cat? 	deaddaughterconfetti	80	21	10	"I'm trying to adopt a rescue cat, Trinity, from North Carolina. There's a bit of back story, but the tl;dr is that I found a cat who is a perfect fit for our household, and she's in Raleigh. I recently moved to Oakland from the southeast and can't afford a round-trip flight to pick her up and don't want to send her cargo, but could pay for someone to carry her in-cabin if they were already making the flight from Raleigh to the Bay Area.

If you know of any flight attendants, anyone who is flying round trip this holiday season, or have family coming in from Raleigh to the Bay Area (any airport within two or three hours drive of Oakland), any help would be greatly appreciated. Her owner would meet you at RDU with Trinity in a soft-side carrier, and you would only need to take her through security and on the flight. I would meet you at the airport to pick her up, and could drive you wherever you needed to go within a reasonable distance (better than a cab, I suppose).

I can pay the fee to fly her in-cabin as well as $100 to compensate her courier for their troubles.

---
The back story, for anyone who is interested: I've been involved with Siamese and Oriental Shorthair rescue on and off for about ten years, and just recently lost two of my three cats within five months of each other (one to lymphoma at age 8, one from diabetic complications/old age at age ~20). That leaves me with one extremely lonely cat, Petrie, who has never for a single day of his five years been without other cats, and he isn't doing well as an only cat. [This is how Petrie used to spend all of his time](http://imgur.com/qdm7h) (he's the brown and white one, the tabby draped on him is his best buddy who most recently died) and now he just mopes about, cries, and doesn't eat as well as he should. I took him to two vets to make sure there were no underlying health issues causing this behaviour, and they both agreed (after bloodwork and physical exams) that Petrie's miserable as hell and needs other cats. 

Enter Trinity, who is a confirmed snuggler and highly social with other cats. [This is a link to Trinity's picture](http://imgur.com/sYD0y). She's a calico Oriental Shorthair with some corneal damage who is on her third home, and I'm hoping to be her last stop. She was in a hoarder situation (&gt;35 cats in a small trailer) and after rescue lived with a vet who can no longer keep her due to a rough family situation. Since she was from a hoarding situation, she is VERY cat-oriented, and her current owner thinks she'd be perfect as a companion cat to my remaining guy. "	t5_2qh3u	True
