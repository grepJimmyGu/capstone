There is no director narrative, no generals interviewed, no government talking heads and no anti-war opponents shown.

The man responsible for the production of the film, Tim Hetherington, was killed in Libya during the uprising while filming another documentary there. Give it a try.

1369864906.0	1faosr	Four Rooms - One of Tarantino's lesser known projects, totally underrated movie!	Randomguy282	129	12	15	"The movie actually has four different directors, each who direct their own segments of the movie which tie in to each other. 

It stars Tim Roth who is hilarious as the main character, Ted the bellboy, who in each segment of the movie is put through a new ridiculous and funny situation. 

Also stars Bruce Willis, Antonio Banderas, and Jennifer Beals(gorgeous), in addition to some others you may recognize. 

My only gripe is the first segment, it's super weird and probably turns a lot of people off the movie. It can still be very funny though as long as you're prepared for it. And then the last 3 segments are gold! 

If you like quirky movies, adult humor and well written dialogue then give this movie a watch, you won't regret it! "	t5_2s1cv	True

DrMyxo	49	3	7	"Voice acting done by stars like Elijah Wood (Beck), Paul Reubens (Pavel), and Mandy Moore (Mara) to name a few. The action is very rewarding with disc battles, martial arts and light cycles/vehicles galore. Stuff derezzing throughout the show is always satisfying. Lastly the art style is excellent. In the first couple episodes I thought it was strange but it quickly grew on me and I think the artists got better as the series went on. This show has some of the best framing (cinematography?) that I've seen in a cartoon with gorgeous long shots and close ups. So much so, I plan on going back and grabbing screenshots. Also, the music is scored by Joseph Trapanese who arranged Daft Punk's score for the Movie which allows it to feel right at home with the latest film. One of the most rewarding cartoons I've seen.

If you're like me, you probably scrolled right on over this one without really giving it a chance. You probably remember it being in theaters and thinking: 
""Another one? Seriously?""
You probably remember the first Scream, and how awesome it was at the time. And maybe vaguely remember the second one, and that it had some sort of a twist ending. I have no memory of number Three, though I know I watched it. 
You probably see my point. The series was pretty much over and the thought of another doesn't sound appetizing. Scream had ran its course, a solid trilogy, but no more. At least that's what I thought. 
The is movie was so awesome that the club can't even handle it right now. Wes Craven really outdid himself on this one. I won't get into any details, because this movie kept me guessing through and through, anything I could mention might sway your suspicions about characters, and for me trying to figure the killer is part of the experience. No spoilers, it had possibly the best death via stabbing I've ever seen. By the end I was on the edge of my seat, flailing and gasping like an idiot. It just kept delivering.

It's David's ticket to an Ivy League education and a way out of his Rust Belt hometown, but there's one condition: the school's elders ask him to be discreet about his religion. At first willing to do so, David struggles with his silence about his faith as his popularity grows. David strikes up a friendship with his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and a possible romance with Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), a student at a nearby girls' school. When jealous classmate Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon) learns David's secret at an alumni party, he exposes the school's new gridiron hero, and David faces the full force of religious intolerance from the prejudiced WASP institution. Also featuring early performances from Ben Affleck, Anthony Rapp, and Cole Hauser, School Ties was loosely based on the real-life experiences of producer Dick Wolf, creator of TV's popular series Law &amp; Order. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi	t5_2s1cv	True

1366399107.0	1coylr	In light of what has happened in Boston...	mookdaruch	43	13	16	"One of my favorite TV series is The West Wing. I am 20 years old and watched the entirety of the series between February 10th and March 6th of this year and I hope that goes to show you just how fantastic this series really is.

I know it may not be a show that interests a lot of people but there is a single episode of this show that I think absolutely everyone must watch at least once.

Following the attacks of September 11, 2001 Aaron Sorkin, the creator of ""The West Wing,"" wrote a response episode entitled ""[Isaac and Ishmael] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_and_Ishmael)"" This episode was conceived, written, filmed, approved, and finally aired on October 3 2001, only 22 days after the world came to a grinding halt for millions of people. On Netflix this particular show is listed as Season 3 Episode 01 even though it does not technically occur in the same timeline as the rest of the series.

Even if you've never seen The West Wing, even if you have no interest in politics, even if you haven't been even the slightest bit affected by the bombings in Boston or the wars in the Middle East I highly encourage you to watch this incredible work of art. [I promise that you won't regret it.](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70262127&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=The+West+Wing%3A+Ssn+3%3A+Isaac+and+Ishmael)"	t5_2s1cv	True

1368180627.0	1e27nr	Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated breathes new life into a classic while staying faithful to the reasons you loved it in the first place.	lordmonkeyfist	38	10	8	"It's an updating done right for the most part. 

**Summary:**

It takes place in the first years of being Mystery Inc. There hometown makes all it's money off of tourism from being the most haunted place in the country so people don't like the meddling kids so much as try to tolerate them. They're also trying to find out what happened to the original Mystery Inc who mysteriously vanished as teenagers.

**Why it works:**
 
* The plot is genuinely interesting and works very well as a prequel. They are able to have the cliche formulaic adventures associated with the show while providing a very lite but interesting arc that works well in the modern times and might hook you.

* The humor is great. It's funniest jokes come from self-parody out of respect and homage similar to A Pup Named Scooby Doo while still adding some of it's own flavor humor-wise. 

* For the most part, comedy and atmosphere is mixed as well as the original show.

* Countless horror references and parodies that older viewers will get and enjoy but is still kept in tone for kids to watch. Expect Saw, Twin Peaks, HP Lovecraft, Vincent Van Ghoul as a Vincent Price equivalent, and that kind of stuff to show up.

* The animation takes inspiration from 70's colors and the classic series' backgrounds but makes it more angled, cinematic, and colorful. It strikes the right feeling of old, faithful, and familiar but new, sleeker, and refreshing and just interesting. Some of the backgrounds are beautiful on it's own. Characters are strictly retro though.

* It has cameos from countless Hanna Barbera cartoons. There's even an episode where Scooby, Jibber Jab, Captain Caveman, and Speed Buggy team up. There are more characters in other episodes.

* Casey Kasem, the original voice Shaggy has retired. Matthew Lillard, who played Shaggy in the live-action movies, replaced him and seems like a natural fit. Kasem still provides his voice for Shaggy's dad in a few episodes. The original Fred *is still* voicing Fred and is now voicing Scooby. Patrick Warburton(Kronk from Emperor's New Groove, Rules of Engagement) does hilarious voice over work as the town Sheriff. Not to mention Lewis Black playing the part of Mister E, a guy involved in the show long arc. 

Basically, it's just great at balancing everything and updating it for the times while not straying too far from the roots that we love it for.

**Disclaimer:**
The great outweigh the bad but I do have to mention Daphne and Fred pair up but it kind off feels natural. Shaggy and Velma are a couple for a bit which just doesn't work and they focus too much time on it but the writers thankfully end that.

I know this will be a deal breaker for some so I had to mention it or at least recommend checking out a later episode first. "	t5_2s1cv	True

1. It has to be streaming on Netflix (obviously that's why I'm here)

2. Not too cerebral. My brain hurts enough. If I was feeling well, I'd say 
bring that shit on, but not today.

3.  Comedies preferred, but I'll take anything if it's awesome.

*Set in and around Galway on Ireland's rugged western coast, Ken Bruen's bestselling crime novels leap to life in this series of TV movies featuring Jack Taylor, an alcoholic cop-turned-private-investigator who runs his new business from a barstool.*

I enjoyed the 3 episodes Netflix has up, sadly there are 5 episode but Netflix only as the first 3 but not to worry these three are quite entertaining. I don't want to say too much because you basically get the gist of the show from the given description but aside from that i really liked the color grade of the show and the overall feeling i got but i also enjoy ""little european films"" that follow in the same style as this such as *The Guard* or *Perrier's Bounty*

Plus, if you are a fan of Jorah Mormont from Game of Thrones, the actor Iain Glen is the leading man in this show and don't expect him sound anything like he does in GoT.  He fully embraces a thick Irish or his native Scottish accent (i can't tell, either way it's super thick and thoroughly enjoyable.) "	t5_2s1cv	True

I'm the kind of guy who watches shows chronologically even if it's a show where you can watch any episode, but with shows like Samurai Jack or even Adventure Time to a degree it kinda sucks not being able to watch the full series.

Well it may not be to everyone's taste, I recommend giving it a try. It's utterly brilliant. It's a shame dreadful pop-punk band stole the shows name.

I'm not going to link these, just looks 'em up and see if you have 'em. 

* Transformers Dark of the Moon: I know this isn't necessarily great but it's dumb fun and if you need something cool to look at give it a go. 
 
* Thor: I found this to be pretty boring but if you need to do your homework for The Avengers, it's on Netflix. 

* Unstoppable: Fun intense action about a unmanned run away train. 

* Never let Me Go: Good movie, well reviewed with some neat sci-fi principles. 

* Midnight in Paris: A Woody Allen rom-com with a 92% on RT.

* Misfits: A UK series kind of like Heroes and really good. Only has one season, so if you end up hooked you will have to find other ways to see the other seasons

* Justified: Really cool show, which is in the 3rd season now, but we only have season 1. I think the episodes are out of order so be careful and do some looking online to figure out the order. 

* Win Win: A comedy drama starring Paul Giamatti and got a 94% on RT. 

These are just a few, while Canadians may not have the depth of catalogue as our US counterparts, there are still lots of decent picks on Netflix Canada. "	t5_2s1cv	True

1356929350.0	15pizf	Gossip Girl	aceshighsays	2	4	0	I was looking for a show similar to Dawson's Creek and One Tree Hill; I was able to find something much better. Just finished watching season 5, need to locate season 6 ASAP. I liked most of the story lines, plot twists, character development, impeccable character attire and the characters have really good chemistry. The acting wasn't incredible, but it isn't that type of show. The only thing that drove me crazy was the product placement of HP computers. 	t5_2s1cv	True

1368385835.0	1e73vo	I'm canceling Netflix as soon as my trial is over.	dafragsta	2	4	1	"I had Netflix streaming/DVD for about a year two years ago because there was a total lack of new, good content, and I'm about to cancel again for the same reasons.  Look how frequently this sub gets a solid submission! No, I refuse to endorse this kind of half-assed service with a totally subpar selection. I signed up for the trial about 2-3 weeks ago and aside from House of Cards, which IS fantastic, I've been very hard pressed to find content worth watching. I will not subsidize shitty content that I don't care about. That's why I dropped cable. I feel like Netflix is just trying to ease their audience into this weak sauce, without making any attempt to up the ante aside from ONE original show, when they should be in the business of shrewdly acquiring all the other networks' content, which their former rental competition had no problems with, nor do they probably wrestle with on the physical media side of their business. Netflix streaming is pretty much the same ""house of cards"" itself, that it was a few years ago."	t5_2s1cv	True
