There are a couple buried threads in the Episode 10 discussion but this is too cool to stay in the shadows.

Hannibal is headed by Bryan Fuller.  Back in 2003 he created a show called Dead Like Me.  The lead character was Georgia (George) played by Ellen Muth, a girl who dies and becomes a Grim Reaper with Mandy Patinkin for a boss.

Jump to episode 10 of Hannibal, the killer is Georgia, played by the same actress, Ellen Muth, suffering from Cotard's Syndrome, a condition where she thinks she is dead.

Bryan Fuller was basically able to setup a hidden storyline so that Dead Like Me wound up being an entire delusion Georgia experienced while suffering from Cotard's Syndrome.  This was an absolutely brilliant linking to his previous material that worked as a huge bonus if you were aware of it, while not negatively impacting the primary storyline if you didn't.

1369421961.0	1ezju5	Any fans of both Hannibal AND Dexter?	randy_horton	76	15	45	"Sorry if this has been discussed, but just wanted to make conversation. The reason why I'm comparing both shows besides the obvious, is that there are no other shows to my knowledge that share the same type of idea.

I have been loyal to Dexter since season 1. Admittedly for the last 3 or so seasons I have felt very forced to watch the show just so I can have closure, since the seasons after Trinity Killer have just been very blah in my opinion. It's been riddled with terrible writing.

Fast forward and I watch the first 3 episodes of Hannibal, I instantly became a fan of EVERYTHING it encompasses. The cinematography, lighting, beautiful gore, character development, writing, acting, everything just seems so... Flawless. As though I'm watching a big budget movie or in the very least a show that would be seen on premium cable. On the other hand, if Hannibal were to end after one or two seasons, I think I would be perfectly okay with that because I'm not a fan of shows stretching things out past their welcome.

Maybe this is just one long rant about nothing, but my main point is that the first 9 episodes of Hannibal have been so much better than the last 4 seasons of Dexter. But Hannibal in my opinion will never get even close to the recognition and following that Dexter has, even with it being on basic cable, and that *sucks*.

He is her only remaining patient. There is no evidence of her interacting with any other person. We know that she was attacked by a patient in the past and that the attacker ""died"".  I think she was referring to a metaphorical ""death"" of his last vestiges of human compassion.

1368172983.0	1e23sh	Franklin. Hannibal. One in the same?	cjsd815	40	4	31	"""I hate being this neurotic.""
""If you weren't neurotic, Franklin, you would be something much worse.""

This is the first exchange we see between these two characters, and the first time we see either of them, period, in the pilot episode. I was thinking about this earlier today before even watching Sorbet (I'm still not entirely sure why) and the episode further solidified in my mind that there is a pretty god damn deep connection between these two men. To one of them, it is fantasized and infatuated. To the other, it's off-putting, maybe even a teeny, tiny bit frightening (this is Hannibal we're talking about, after all).

Franklin's neuroses are, at least somewhat, improved in the time frame between the Aperitif and Sorbet. He's no longer a sobbing, crippled mess, he has a friend that he obviously somewhat enjoys the company of, and he can handle himself in public.

However, when we get to his first session with Hannibal in Sorbet, he reveals that he ""showed up"" at the opera because he ""thought [Hannibal] might like that sort of thing too."" In fact, everyone at the opera seems to want a piece of Hannibal, but Franklin really needs a friend. In a delusional sense, too. The guy thinks he could have saved Michael Jackson. ""In this Michael Jackson fantasy, how is your friendship returned?"" Hannibal asks. Franklin responds with the very simple and honest response, ""I just get to touch greatness.""

And then Hannibal begins his own soul-searching as a result of this. How many friends does Hannibal *really* have? We see the obvious addressing of this issue when Hannibal, with the creepiest get-up, hairdo, and skin complexion we've ever seen him have, goes to see Agent Scully for a therapy session. She lays out, in very cold and blatant terms, the nature of their relationship (she offers him a glass of wine, just because she's not officially a psychologist anymore, but that's it). And we see him in a strange mirror of Franklin's position, though perhaps even more pitiful in comparison.

Hannibal asserts, timidly and with a hint of defense, that he is as honest and real as anyone. That he has friends, and opportunities of friends. That he and she are friendly. When she dispassionately refutes that he is her patient and colleague and nothing more, it's hard not to notice the slight sting of loneliness that she mentioned on Mikkelsen's chiseled, disciplined expression.

And then, of course, Hannibal gleefully insists on sharing a glass of wine (White Zinfandel? I wonder what the significance of Hannibal's preference for pinks is) with Will during their appointment.

And then he offers Alana a glass of beer from ""her own private reserve"" brewed and bottled by Hannibal himself, and attempts very flattering flirtation.

But then the second appointment with Franklin comes along, where he discusses his sighting of Hannibal at a grocery store while with his friend, Tobias. Past all the talk of his love of cheese, Hannibal asks two very intuitive yet very spontaneous questions:

""Do you desire Tobias, sexually?""
and
""You care deeply about Tobias. Despite differences, he is your best friend, but you are not his.""

Now, this may seem like a jumping off into wild speculation, but I think that at this point in his life, Hannibal is trying desperately to cultivate real relationships with people he truly has something in common with, even when they are really his adversaries. Hannibal's grand dinner parties are with people he couldn't care less about, with people demanding the luxury and excess he's proven so capable of providing.

However, have Will, Jack, Alana, or Abigail ever *invited* Hannibal, in a personal manner, to come see them? He shows up unannounced at the hospital to see Abigail several times, and even seeks Will out fairly late at night two hours after he's missed his appointment. These are all people Hannibal clearly likes, and in certain cases, maybe loves. However, as he cares deeply for them, he feels as though they clearly have many more things going on than enjoying exquisite meals at his immaculate estate.

My conclusion, since this is getting really fucking long: Hannibal is deeply infatuated by those who challenge him, and arguably in love with those who he feels he can both relate to and empower. His feelings toward Abigail are, as has been mentioned before in this subreddit, clearly paternal, and I would argue that he is falling very much in love with Will, to the point that I see his flirtations with Alana more than anything as a power play to make Will jealous.

This is, at least, what I hope this episode was trying to convey. I think the daring subtlety of these relationships and even the complete disregard of common prejudices (I loved Franklin's humble, open admission that he had ""tried things"" in fraternities and that Tobias was simply ""not his brand"") are something truly unique to this show and they set an enormously ambitious precedent for the following seasons, should they happen.

But in regards to my thoughts about Franklin and Hannibal, I would like to hear what you guys think."	t5_2vs7z	True

This is exactly what I see people saying a few years from now when they finally grasp onto the bandwagon. 

I love this show because it is slow in its reveals. Most people wanted the opposite. They want the pilot to show Hannibal going all crazy on someone. They preferred to see an hour long shit fest of rancid jokes and an obvious tie-in to the movies or something, anything.

Sadly Hannibal doesn't deliver on the ""Honey Boo Boo"" crowd. And I think most people in this area of reddit know why.

The story is incredibly done. The character development has had me on the edge of my seat. I almost feel a sense of ""Fireflyesque"" nostalgia. Seeing the story develop over the first season and how each person just glimpses at another piece of their personality each episode is amazing to watch. I know this Hannibal ultimately gets caught and turned into what we first see in Silence of the Lambs, but this series has not failed on feeding my thoughts on how the man in ""Lambs"" came to be.

Mads deserves all kinds of awards for the roles in this show and movies he has done. He is an amazing actor. From portraying a stone-cold viking who never has to say a word in-order to make people cower, a ruthless bond villain who meets a horrible end, to an educated and ""high society"" psychiatrist is one hell of a resume. Not many actors can cross genres well.

Hugh Dancy...It's hard to describe. His acting is perfect for a ""paranoid, delusional"" person. But this last episode made me think so much more about this ""illness"" he goes through. Which is why I love this show so much. Now his illness is somehow tied to his ability to ""breakdown"" the entire construct of a killer.

 It's amazing to think this show is supposed to have more seasons with what's already been revealed. It has an inevitable end. I can only hope the writing does not try to ""fluff"" a season or two up. I don't think other shows would be as popular if the writers wrote for it to have no clear ending.

""Fireflyesque""

- I both love and hate the mental instability of Will Graham at the same time. It's fascinating, but at the same time I hate seeing him this vulnerable - after all, this is the man who will take down one of the most intelligent villains ever.

- There's too much going on. Every episode, another killer. Yes, this is the norm for any detective/crime thriller, but these aren't any killers, they are total 'psychos'. So far, we have [Spoiler](/s ""A cannibal (in addition to Hannibal), a guy who uses victims as a fertilizer to grow mushrooms, a 'mother figure' who has children kill their parents and someone who transforms his victims into angels."") And that's only up to ep 5, where I am at the moment. That's a lot happening in a very short space of time, and often these stories feel crammed, playing second fiddle (rightly) to more important back stories. And this ties in to my next point.

- Everything is solved far too easily. The realisation process seems very rushed to me. One second, they are none the wiser, but suddenly Graham sees it all. No real detective work is ever really carried out, it just seems like Will is more an all seeing god than a behavioral science investigator.

As I say, I love this show, but it's important to be critical of things we enjoy, rather than constantly throwing blind praise at it. So I ask you, what is your critique of this show?"	t5_2vs7z	True

1367407678.0	1dh4g3	Seriously? Why was it banned again?	GrizzlyDog	33	5	26	"So I just watched the entire version of episode 4 (the one *not* aired in N. America).

Seriously, I simply don't get it.  How was this any more gruesome or twisted than any other episode, or more to the point - any other adult themed show that airs on TV?

I really didn't understand what all the fuss was about.  I kept waiting for *something* that never materialized.

Otherwise an interesting episode.

I do note however, that the whole story with the woman and abducted kids seemed 'rushed through'.   I think there was much more potential there to explore and expand upon with real substance.  The woman playing the 'nut' in this instance should have had more leeway/screentime to flesh out the character.

That being said, I recognize they only have X minutes to do an episode.

My concern is that they are rushing through the 1st season and ""firing all of their guns at once"" (kind of like Lie to Me did) with nothing for season 2 other than a bunch of boring character exploration and interplay of who's gonna fuck who kind of thing.

So far, in the 5 episodes aired.  They could have stretched *them* into a full season.

I feel they are writing the season much like a young man makes love.  Lot's of enthusiasm with no control and it is intense, quick, and over.

Anyway, my 2 cents.  If anyone has any ideas on why exactly the 4th episode was held back in the US&amp;Canada I'd love to hear them.

1366993700.0	1d5u77	Just needed to comment on the beautiful artistry to the characters and sets...	sleepdeprivedtechie	31	4	13	"I am blown away by the costuming and set departments for this show.  Freddie Lounds is always dressed ""louder"" than anyone in the scene, they over exaggerate and highlight that red hair to purposely make you feel uncomfortable; that she doesn't fit, she's there to make trouble.  In the third episode, when she visits [Abigail in the hospital](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/cleolinda/1427760/449169/449169_original.png), the division of the scene by the set just helps lend to that feeling. She stands, blazing red, in cheetah print against the stark blue walls while Abigail is shown against the yellow, flowery wallpaper (sorry for the horrible picture).  The only person that eclipses Freddie is Lecter, and it's only in certain scenes.  When he catches [Freddie eavesdropping](http://media.monstersandcritics.com/articles3/1714113/article_images/NUP_152017_0837.jpg), they sit on a blue couch against a red wall; the things that make her individual, the red hair and costuming, are now drowned out against the wall and Lecter is highlighted in that sleek blue suit. Vertical lines are also beautifully used to ""divide"" good and evil like [here](http://media.monstersandcritics.com/articles3/1714113/article_images/NUP_152017_0981.jpg)  and [here](http://media.monstersandcritics.com/articles3/1714113/article_images/NUP_152017_0831.jpg).  This is the first show in a long time where not only do the storylines and characters catch me, but I find myself looking at the sets and costuming.  Absolutely gorgeous!  

Edit 2: The presentation of the food in the show is also amazing.  It looks so good it makes me think ""If I wasn't 90% sure that the meat is people, I'd love to try that!"" It really makes you as the audience stop and think.

""The eggs are called High Life Eggs. The recipe is taken from a 19th century cookbook by esteemed Spanish culinary writer, Angel Muro. You heat 1/4 inch of olive oil in a heavy pan and when it's hot, you drop in a slice of brioche bread that has a hole cut in the middle. In the hole you crack an egg. You can sprinkle chopped onions, paprika, chopped tomatoes, salt on the egg part to season. When the white starts to firm up and the bread browns, you flip it over and fry the other side - not too long because you want the yolk to be runny. And that's it!""

**Update:**

Janice just sent me this as well:

""When you cut the hole in the brioche slice, don't cut all the way through - so in a thick slice (say, 3/4 inch) just scoop out the bread two-thirds of the way down.  It's a bit trickier but leave one side intact so that you have, in effect, a cup into which you drop the egg.  When you are frying it, you don't have to flip it over if you want the egg sunny side up."""	t5_2vs7z	True

The scene in which Hannibal initially talk to Tobias in his shop bears a couple of similarities to the dinner scene in Red Dragon [which can be found here](http://www.anyclip.com/movies/red-dragon/dinner/).

It's far from a verbatim quote, but the general concept of the artist from the orchestra dying and then someone noting that they are ""relieved"" he is no longer playing and that the orchestra is ""better for it"" are basically identical.

Will, pure empathy and thinks he is a broken damaged man

Hannibal is struggling because he wants to be ""normal"" and feel things  and have relationships like a human, but his superior narcissistic side fights back

Hannibal killed the girl in the field to play with Will and show him that he was in fact an artist and more evolved killer than Hobbs, whom everyone thought in high regard.  A way of saying ""no, i'll show you a real killer.""  Also, Hannibal is such a sociopath that he cannot feel anything, and he was just trying to feel the intense love that Hobbs felt and figured recreating his murder could provide him that glimpse of feeling.

His other murders are for his food - which replaced his career as a surgeon - a failed career because he messed up, and Hannibal does not fail.  Narcissistic sociopath 

He needs this confirmation because he actually lacks creativity because he doesn't have feelings.  Yes he likes art, cooking, music, clothing, but I think its all at such effort.  all those endeavors are so perfect, by the book if you will, that there is no creative expression.  

A good example is his outfits (i knew nothing about fashion so this might be wrong).  The are so crazy with mismatched patters and colors that you think he would be more ""flamboyant""  but he is so stiff, and the clothes are so perfect that the craziness is muted.  He is such an intelligent sociopath that he knows exactly what to say at the appropriate time (witty quip, or flirting) - but its just off because it is not real."	t5_2vs7z	True

We know Hannibal has been manipulating Will to get him to believe he's killed; to make him more like Hannibal himself.  Having Will incarcerated may have also been the plan as it attacks Will's already weakened psyche and allows Hannibal to offer his professional assistance to help Will get better; to get closer to Will.
But all of this is to what end?  Is he playing with Will?  Is he merely just curious to see what happens?  Or is he trying to bring Will closer?  Is he trying to shape Will into someone who could accept his true self?  Is he trying to make a friend?
I think the answer to this lies in my favourite scene of the series.  I can't find a link to it, but it's where Hannibal opens his office door expecting to see Will for his appointment, but Will isn't there.  The way his seemingly genuine smile drops - first perplexed, then feigning disinterest, then a hint of sadness - tells me that he really, really wanted to see Will.  His reaction almost seemed a little petulant (fine, I didn't want to see Will anyway).  Mads played it perfectly.  I doubt the scene last more than 10 seconds, but it's exposes so much of Hannibal.  Because no one else is there, this is pure Hannibal.  Any 'acting' he does is to fool himself, not someone else.  He tries to play off the missed appointment as a trifle, but you can see that he's really hurt by it.  He wanted to play with his new friend, but his new friend stood him up.  
Anyway, that's my thoughts on it.  What do you think?  Is Will a game to Hannibal or something more?"	t5_2vs7z	True

In Fromage:

-The scene where Hannibal takes the dish out of the oven with a blue cloth mirrors the scene where he picks up the stag statue with a blue cloth to hit Tobias.

-When Tobias and Hannibal are having dinner, Tobias says, ""I was going to kill you,"" and Hannibal says something like, ""Of course you were. I'm lean, and the lean yield the toughest gut."" He would know this since he knows a lot about cooking humans.

Caution!  Wild guess follows!

 
Granted, Will may well be cracking due to his frail mental state.  I , however, started wondering if all his dreams and hallucinations could be helped on the way by some judicious drugging by Hannibal?  We know he's got a key and has helped feed Will's dogs on occasion,  isn't it possible that he snuck some hallucinogens into a handy medium to push Will over the edge?

The main hinderance to this idea is the fact that so far the show has shown us nearly all of Hannibal's morally questionable actions and drugging Will would be a pretty big one."	t5_2vs7z	True

A lot of what Will states when in shiny happy empath mode is actually quite obvious. I swear like 3/4 of what he states is achievable with common sense...especially considering how smart the people around him are.

In the last episodes we can see the great challenge involved in having to mix a story about finding and stopping the villain du jour while developing a complicated narrative about characters working at cross-purposes.

To put it bluntly, the villain is getting shoe-horned in, with as much or more screen time given to other matters.  And with so much going on in the last two episodes (Crawford's family situation, Abigail's recovery) I lost track of the method and procedure, the sense that they are urgently working a case.  I suddenly had this bizarre sense that we solve crimes by:

1. Visiting a grizzly scene of carnage.  
1. Cooking a gourmet meal.  
1. Yelling at underlings, maybe while they were trying to teach a class.  
1. Conversing with a person who is standing on a balcony.  
1. Suddenly pouncing on the killer because facts coalesced out of nowhere.

Where I end up is: I want a good case, and I want a tense story about Hannibal's manipulations, but I don't want a half-assed case and some tense story.  Does that make sense?

Part of my concern stems from watching [Awake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839683/) suffer from this same problem a year ago.  Neat concept, great cast, but with far too much going on to make the episodic case format work, so it ended up an unsatisfying muddle.

1370646313.0	1fw7xf	Thoughts on Dr. Abel Gideon [Show Spoilers]	thedanyon	24	5	2	"OK stick with me this is just a fun thought that I had while watching the most recent episode:

 Abel is a biblical forename that comes from the word for 'breath' or 'vapor' in Hebrew. It is connected to the biblical story of Cain and Abel which, boiled down, is a murder story (fits right in). However, Cain is the murderer while Abel is the victim which makes for an interesting name choice in the show as Dr. Abel Gideon, while an evil person, has been victimized by many Psychiatrists (including Hannibals mind-games in the episode) into making him think he is the Ripper...which gets him into the story...which gets him killed.

Cain, from the little I know of the story, was capable of murder and as an old explanation says, because of that capability was thought to be the offspring of Satan, or Satan himself. This fits nicely as, we who have seen the episode know that, Hannibal clearly gets Abel killed and Mads as well as many others have described the character of Hannibal as ""satan or the embodiment of him"" which connects Hannibal to Cain thus completing the correlation.

Another connection is that, as mentioned before, Abel means 'breath' or 'vapor' which are closely connected with wind. Wind is mentioned in some Wendigo tales i've read as people who come into contact witht he beast hear familiar voices carried on the wind. As the Wendigo exercises a level of ""control"" over the wind (breath, vapor), Hannibal wields control over Abel (breath, vapor)

[In case none of that interested you. Here is a fun little picture I found of a depiction of a Wendigo that fits nicely with a certain something in the show that we all love. *Notice the exposed ribs, windpipes, and organs like some of the victims in the show](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs45/i/2009/095/0/d/Wendigo_by_Monkey_Paw.png)"	t5_2vs7z	True

Six episodes into this season, beyond the individual themes of each episode of family, trust, and mental stability, the overarching theme of Hannibal's first season could be established with dreams as the battleground for the soul.  Will Graham fights for the soul day and night, though whether he is winning is up for debate.

Will Graham's inability to sleep at night results in sleepwalking, daydreaming, and a general disassociation from reality during the day.  What causes his restlessness?  Is it the gruesome murders he's observed during the day or is it the battle to stifle his attraction to them in the first place?  His brain is cognitively aware that he enjoys each murder, can appreciate why they were committed in the first place, but his sense of morality punishes himself for that thought.  There is cognitive dissonance in Will Graham's head over his soul's battle for good and evil; he doesn't know which side will win.

His ability to empathize with the killers the FBI hunts always begins with the metronome windshield washer that swipes the screen, signifying his exit from reality and entrance to his dream world. Does he wipe away the world with this pendulum or is he wiping away himself?  As he enters these killers' worlds, he's entering their train of thought and motive, so following that logic, he's wiping away his ability to be good.  It would appear after each entrance/exit to each world, he's losing pieces of himself.  He comes back more empathetic, more understanding of the violence, and more horrified of the battle he's losing.

Will's brain ultimately wants him to win on the side of good, presenting the specter of the raven feathered stag as a warning at every opportunity.  The stag is the culmination of the victim topped stag head that Hannibal presented, punctured with ravens attacking their carrion.  Will's subconscious knows that incident, that one murder out of the others, is extremely important.  It haunts him and the feathered stag is his brain screaming, Hannibal walks and watches beside you.

With the disillusion of canonical future events in the sixth episode Entrée, such as the Wounded Man sketches and the unfortunate demise of a young FBI agent, Will Graham's assumed success at resolving these two parts of his brain, the evil and good, is out the window.  With this new timeline, Will might very well fail.  There is no guarantee that he will win at the end of the day and that makes this series all the more exciting.  Based on his latest reaction after entering his dream world, eye for an eye, his evil side is pulling ahead and this presents interesting opportunities to come."	t5_2vs7z	True

After watching the series I read the books again and noticed that Hannibal (in Silence of the lambs) convinces another prisoner to swallow his tongue after throwing semen at Clarice Starling's face.

In the series, Hannibal hints at some point to a patient that attacked his psychiatrist Du Marier. This patient swallowed his tongue, so that her life was saved. The way Hannibal asked her whether she felt responsible made me think she had something to do with his death (or Hannibal had something to do with it), but it never becomes clear what really happened. 

Du Marier is - for me - one of the most intriguing persons in the show. Is she aware of who Hannibal really is? And if she knows, does she approve? The last episode when they eat together, she somehow gave me the feeling that she DOES know Hannibal for what he is. 

So might it be possible that she killed her attacker by making him swallow his tongue and that Hannibal knows (of had an active part in the murder)? If he knows, he can blackmail her and make her part of his twisted world in their sessions without the fear that she will go to the police. That explains her hostility towards Crawford, she knows Hannibal is a murderer but she knows that if they find out, she might be charged with murder as well. What do you guys think?

tldr; Du Marier has a patient with swallowed tongue, Hannibal makes a prisoner swallow his tongue in Silence of the lambs. Du Marier might not be as innocent as she tries to look. "	t5_2vs7z	True

Hannibal has been vocal about how he feels about Crawford and the pressure Will is under from working as a special agent because he's trying to encourage Will to see Crawford as a source of instability.  I suspect the reason he killed the doctor was so that Will would question his own sanity and whether or not he himself was responsible for the doctor's death.	t5_2vs7z	True

As someone who started watching The Following from the premiere, I quit after three episodes.  Slipshod writing and terrible conceits; sexist depictions of women and poor race representations. My friends quit watching well before the finale as well.  

Counter that with Hannibal. Word of mouth is spreading every day as each new episode delves deeper into beautiful and frightening themes.

At the beginning of the show, the first episode, when Jack goes to Hannibal's office he ask whether Hannibal has a secretary or not. Hannibal replies saying 

*Was pre-dispositioned to romantic 
whims. Followed her heart to the 
United Kingdom. Sad to see her go.*

I started thinking; the first ever we see of Hannibal is him eating and we all know what he eats. I mean almost always, as far as I can remember, we have only ever seen Hannibal eat/feed human meat. 
Now, supposing that what we see Hannibal eat in the very first episode,the first time we see him, is human meat than this question comes to my mind; Who was he eating?

And after re-watching the first episode I have this lingering feeling that Hannibal killed his secretary, maybe because her 'love affair' was seen as something unacceptable by him, then ate her and came up with a story for why she wasn't there.

Do you think Hannibal will get enough seasons to tell the complete story while getting a proper ending to wrap everything up? Or do you think NBC are going to cancel this, milk it or whatever else? I'd love to hear what you think.

I, personally, despise when a show is cancelled without a proper ending or worse, on a massive cliff-hanger. This thought is usually what stops me from buying any blu rays of a season until I know for sure it's getting a proper ending. Yet for some reason, in this year 2013 I have at least 2 shows *(including Hannibal)* that I am considering just getting anyway because of how fucking good their first season was. The other show, Banshee, I have more faith in but the whole point of this post is that NBC is a broadcast network, has a shoddy history of seemingly caring more about the ratings than giving the show a proper chance, and Hannibal is such a big hit in terms of quality I'm afraid NBC just isn't sure how to handle it and might butcher it in later seasons with forced product placement or firing writers/showrunners to artificially keep the story going.

So the first season was always headed in the direction of the last two episodes, where Hannibal plants evidence to make Will a suspect and pushes his mind to the point where it negates his credibility. All nice and neat. Except for Miriam. Will wasn't involved at that point but the real killer was, how could Jack not separate those incidents.

In Sorbet Lecter chose all his victims from his collection of business cards, and it's explicitly shown that he got one of those cards through professional contact with the victim. I don't think we have any reason to believe that the rest of the Chesapeake Ripper's victims were any different, which means that almost all of them would have some paper record of having worked for Lecter. The police would definitely find those records, and how many victims would it take before Lecter's name is the only one that shows up on all the client lists?

Has this been mentioned on the show? The only way around it, that I can think of, is that Lecter chose all but one of his victims randomly... but that doesn't make sense, because how would he have the business cards of random people?

 Essentially the show satisfies my curiosities about crime, psychology, sex, and even… food.  I think all George Costanza would be missing for his trifecta is sports, but really isn’t murder just another kind of sport. 


The genius behind this show, is that it takes a character, that the AFI dubbed the greatest villain of all time, Hannibal Lecter, and gives us more of him every week. It is well written, well filmed, well lit, well-acted , well, well…

And to top of all of this it incorporates gastronomy in a way I have never seen a show like this (besides maybe the Sopranos with Italian food) have done before. 

I do have one small criticism, and that is that I think there could be a little bit more sex. I don’t think it is the error of the show but rather the error of American Society in general. So far as I know this show has not stirred up nearly as much uproar, over its violent content, as you would think a show of its kind would on NBC. 

However, just a few years ago, a nipple slip during the Super bowl was the talk of the nation. Are we saying that cannibalism and murder are less threating to the conservative element in our nation than sex. 

Really I would just like to see the Asian chick in lingerie and I would happy.

1368071042.0	1dzb6v	Who is 'good' in Hannibal?	ohwhatirony	17	1	13	"What makes Hannibal great is its exploration of morals, empathy, and thought. So I pose it to you, reddit..

The thing about everyone is that they believe they have good intentions. We justify our actions, even if we know they could be deemed 'bad.' Hobbs believed he was glorifying the girls, and, in turn, his daughter - by putting 'every part of them' to good use. The pharmacist believed he was unifying people with the earth and making something beautiful. Angel-maker was, well, making angels (and imo this was the best exploration of morals) of demons. Regardless of their intent, the result was death.

What is Hannibal doing? What makes Hannibal creepy is that he doesn't appear to have very good intentions at all. He seems to be killing *for the sake of killing* - he has no justification for his actions, just gratification.

So, then, what makes a person good? Is it what we, the general population, perceive as good? At a time, slavery was considered good and a norm, but is not good today; what and *who* does the value of 'good' depend on? If serial killers, generally labeled by society as 'bad', have good intentions, does that make them good to anyone? Think Death Note. Was Angel Maker justified in killing long-pursued criminals, or is killing bad no matter what? Are we even good, or do we just *think* we all are, and that is what makes us good people?

Clearly, Hannibal is considered the main antagonist, but when we have people like Will Graham sympathizing with the killers, it poses the question - what makes someone good?

I could have phrased this a lot better, but 

**tl;dr** - what do you believe makes a person 'good'? Is it possible for a serial killer, like Angel-maker, to be good? What are Hannibal's intentions, why do you think he saved Abigail, and what is his motive/justification?

1367140735.0	1d9jn1	I can't help but think this whole episode four fiasco could have been easily avoided. [meta-ish?]	tynosaur	17	2	17	"So, I've been reading up on Fuller's decision to pull episode four, and have found these three things to be factual:

* Fuller knew the episode was going to be pulled before the show even premiered, primarily because of the Sandy Hook shootings. The Boston bombings were just even more of a reason to do so.

* The episode's plot-relevant content can be fit into 22 minutes, as seen by the Youtube clips. This is precisely half of the episode. The offending material was episode-specific, and had nothing to do with the characters in the long run. 

* The night the fifth episode ran was the same night as the NFL draft, which is a nightmare for ratings, generally speaking.

So, I ask this: Why didn't they splice the relevant material from the fourth episode into the fifth episode, then air it and advertise it as a special one-and-a-half hour special event? It wouldn't have been difficult to do so, and at most the episode would have had a running time of 67 minutes, well within the time needed to run such a time slot (with commercials). I'm sure they could have spared the slot, *especially* knowing in advance that the episode would run that much longer.

The ""event"" headline would have drawn in viewers, and while the extra content may not have been as interesting as everyone might have liked, you still wouldn't have to go on YouTube like they didn't tell you to do to not be lost the next week.

Apparently there's something like this in Dexter?

In an interview, Gillian says she won't die. However she did make some interesting comments.

“I have conversations with a version of you and hope that the actual you gets what he needs,” she tells him in one of their sessions.

Set to appear in several episodes this season, Gillian says of her character: “(Hannibal’s) not going to get therapy from somebody who can’t match his wit and his intelligence.”

 I think, how one … he’s not going to get therapy from somebody who can’t match his wit and his intelligence""

However, we get to this part:

-What does Hannibal get out of his relationship to your character? What’s he looking for in those psychiatric sessions?

""That’s actually a good question. And I think that question will remain, because it’s elusive.  And I think she probably wonders the same thing. But she knows that it’s serving a purpose, and I think she feels protective of him, for a few reasons. And what we learn is that she is actually retired, but that he wouldn’t accept that. So he’s the only remaining patient she has. And they feed off each other. (Laughs)""

So yeah, in one way, it would make sense and it would be an incredible plot twist. On the other hand, not sure if Bryan would go through this direction? I have a weird gut feeling about this.

So, I just discovered Hannibal like...2 days ago. I loved the pilot, and caught myself up immediately (all the way to episode 8, the violin/cello guy).

I'm kind of...confused. I can't figure out how many of these kills are by Hannibal's hand directly, how many are influenced by him, and how many have basically nothing to do with him.

It starts basically from the beginning. So there's that guy who was killing the college girls, and ""using all the parts,"" (the guy in the pilot who kills his wife/maims his daughter). I thought it was Hannibal who was doing the killings, because of the whole ""he's eating them"" thing. Turns out no, this other guy is a cannibal too! Then, there is a copycat. Is *that* Hannibal?

Then we get the murderers all the way up to the Chesapeake Ripper. It seems pretty clear that Hannibal is not involved in the other murderers (the lost boys, the angel guy, the mushroom-farmer guy). We meet this guy in a mental hospital who *thinks* he is the Chesapeake Ripper, but....he's not? It's actually Hannibal? Yet this guy seems to know intimate details of the Chesapeake Ripper, and the show seems to imply that the mental-institute guy knew details that no one else knew. How did he know them?

Then there's this ""organ havester"" guy, who they think is the Chesapeake Ripper, but...I guess he's not. It's just a coincidence that Hannibal is killing people, taking their organs to eat, while this guy is killing people and taking their organs to sell? Was he set up by hannibal?

Anywho, I just can't figure out how much of this is actually being controlled by Hannibal, and how much of it is mere coincidence around him.

So where can I get my ""fix"".

About the books.......is it worth it to start from the beginning?(which is what title) 
Is there a book that follows on directly where the show left off?

I got the impression that his sister was really the only person he ever genuinely loved.  At the end book Hannibal, Hannibal explains to Clarice that he believes the universe is currently expanding and eventually when it reverts and starts strinking he will need to make room for his sister to come back to earth.*  Hannibal tells Clarice that he is considering killing her in order to make space in the universe because Clarice reminds him of his sister.  Clarice convinces him not to and they live happily ever after the end.



Now there's a lot of talk about does Hannibal really care for Abigail or why would he care for her etc.  I think he's associating Abigail with his sister and I really doubt they're going to bring up his universe thing but I do think that Hannibal is only capable of loving someone who he associates with his sister.

1365995241.0	1cd7ft	My thoughts on the show and general discussion.	supergalacticcaptain	13	0	19	"As a fan of Thomas Harris' Hannibal series I was excited and apprehensive about this show.

So far I am very happy with it, the artistic direction is superb, the overall plot seems very much in the vein of Harris' original books and films.

Mad Mikkelsen is brilliant as Lecter. As soon as he started talking I was impressed, I never though anyone but Anthony Hopkins could hold a candle to that role. But Mikkelsen is great. The subtle nuances of the character are fantastic, you get the sense of foreboding with every word that comes out of his mouth, you know that what he says is never what he means. There's always a sub-text to everything he says, and what he does.

My only gripe with the show is Will Graham being on the autistic/aspergers spectrum. To the best of my memory, Graham was not on the spectrum nor did he exhibit traits of it in Red Dragon (admittedly I could be wrong). To me it feels sort of cheap. It feels as though they were trying to find an easy way for him to be overly analytical without having to explain it too much.

*Having said that,* I think that this plot device works well for the show, as we've seen in episode two, it weaves into the story and creates a dark connection between Graham and the sociopaths he is devoted to stopping.

All in all, I'm already a fanboy, and will watch every episode of this show from now til it's completion.

Would love to discuss the show with other fans here."	t5_2vs7z	True

1372194650.0	1h2avo	Foreshadowing in Hannibal (TV show) from the books.	Beefcakev1	14	5	8	"Hi I am a big fan of the Hannibal books. Watching the TV show I noticed a lot of foreshadowing from the books that people may not have picked up on. I thought I would list them, in no particular order.

1. How Jack Crawford's new partner that he pulled out of classes catches Hannibal the same exact way Will catch's Hannibal in the book Red Dragon. Even down to Hannibal taking off his shoes and sneaking behind him. The only difference is that Will makes a phone call so the FBI bust in right before he was killed. Although Hannibal does nearly disembowel him. 

2. Buffalo Bill parallel. Hannibal meets the serial killer Tobias Budge through one of his patents. This is also how Hannibal met Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb.  Gumb was involved in a relationship with Hannibal's patent.  To add Hannibal ended of killing the patent mirroring the way he killed Tobias's friend. 

3. Will fixing boat motors. After Will catches Hannibal (In the book Red Dragon) he retires to the beach with his family and fixes boat motors for money. He's seen fixing a boat motor in some episodes. 

4. The way Jack finds Miriam Lass, pulls her out of school then puts her on a case because she shows promise is foreshadowing Clarice Starling.

5. Will and his family would take in stray dogs that were lost at his beach house. His wife even says he was obsessed with the dogs.

6. Also if your wondering what the swinging thing is before Will approaches a scene heres an excerpt from the book before he approaches the Leed's house (A crime scene). 'He tried to be still inside. In his mind a silver pendulum swung in darkness. He waited until the pendulum was still.'

7. Will would have surreal violent nightmares about his cases and wake up ringing wet from sweat. 

8. The ending! This is huge foreshadowing but I'm sure you knew that.

That's all I can think of for now. If I got something wrong or forgot something......or If you think this is stupid please tell me.

I just had to learn more.

I discovered a recently published book about it: [***Brain On Fire: My Month Of Madness***](http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Fire-My-Month-Madness/dp/145162137X/). In the book, *New York Post* reporter Susannah Cahalan relates her personal experience with the disorder.

The book is a harrowing read that I found hard to put down. There are a number of similarities between Cahalan's story and the subplot in *Hannibal*, particularly the part about the clock face. I'm guessing the show's writers have read or are at least familiar with the book. I recommend it to viewers of *Hannibal*. You can find more information about the book on the author's web site:

You know how Hannibal offered Alana beer, instead of wine? And obviously, you'd think, hahaha that beer has people in it, doesn't it, and then you focus on the awkward flirting. But. He said that the beer took TWO years to make. 

As you know, beer is fermented stuff.

Miriam Lass was killed two years ago.

Her arm was basically perfect when they found it in that observation hub thing. Obviously it had to be preserved.

Her motivation is nonsensical, the other characters treat her as important despite it making no sense for them to do so. It would be as if the characters in the West Wing constantly let moon-landing conspiracy theorists walk around the white house to create a contrived source of conflict for the story line to draw upon. The show would be great if that character were written out, or at the very least made to behave in somewhat rationally, given some kind of realistic motivation. Every scene with her makes me cringe on behalf of the writers, and fear that the show won't get the time it needs to develop into the coherent series that it has the potential to become.

TV Guide: ""From the beginning, you made it clear you were telling your own story, but do you fear that this choice will alienate some of the diehard Red Dragon fans?""  
  
Fuller: ""If you look at the scant two pages that talk about Will Graham's back story, they tell us that Will was so psychologically compromised from investigating the Minnesota Shrike that he had to become institutionalized. So, I feel like I've got a car jack and I've wedged it in between those lines. I've just opened them up for room to tell more between the lines than what you may have anticipated. But we're also sticking to the canon. We will deliver what we've come to expect in Red Dragon of Will Graham, but he'll just have a longer, harder journey to get there. I gave myself room to wiggle, so *we're going to see some wiggling in the next two seasons*.""

""...And Jeffrey Dahmer [is characterized as] an eccentric chef.""

I had to share this because it made me angry, and then it made me laugh. This guy is berating the creators of a show (the focus of the interview is Newsroom) for glamorizing crimes and misdeeds of humanity, but he can't even get the origin of this character right. 
Hannibal isn't based on Jeffrey Dahmer. He's based on Harris's personal work at crime investigations and other murderers. Also, for anyone to belittle ANY character- especially Hannibal Lecter, one of the most complex, amazing characters of all time- into simply ""an eccentric chef"" is insulting and rude. 
And we know how Hanni feels about people who are rude.

1370420152.0	1fpkr7	TV Spoiler inside: Theory about Hannibal's motives regarding Will	labisa	13	5	13	"Hi there, 

I'm sorry if this was posted already or it is painfully obvious to you guys, but I was thinking about Hannibal's motives regarding Will's mental ""problems"" i.e. him having hallucinations/losing time from encephalitis and Hannibal covering the diagnosis up and somewhat pushing him ""into madness"". (I believe thinking that one is mentally ill is a very good way of actually getting somewhat insane.) 

So, why is Hannibal doing this? 

I could think of two key aspects of his motivation: 

A) He is interested in the way the mind, especially Will's mind, works. I believe this was actually discussed already and also the book (or was it the movie?) Red Dragon was cited in this context: Lecter says to Will something along the lines of ""I'd love to get you on my couch."" 

B) (this is the more interesting one I was not sure was discussed before:) 
**Maybe he wants to create something like an equal to himself?** 

Hannibal already said that there are many similarities between the two of them. But Hannibal is arguably less sane than him.

 ^(I know that Hannibal was described as very sane and very rational, but there is certainly something insane about him. It's just that the psychiartric system cannot describe it because it's so special or complex or something.) 

So, maybe making him more insane would arguably make him more similar to Hannibal, who is very unique in his not-classifiable way which might also make him somewhat lonely. 

He does view Will as some kind of a friend, but can he really be his friend as long as he doesn't truly understand him? Can a sane person truly understand a, by our standards, insane person? 

This idea kind of intrigues me because it seems really fitting. I think Hannibal would like the idea of *creating somebody in his image*, especially because that motive was already used in the show. It is also a kind of bromanc-y point of view because this obviously really plays into the hands of people who want the two of them to be together. They obviously cannot be a *normal* couple/pair of friends, but they could well be together in their private abyss of insanity.

1368939431.0	1em7tm	Book fans, may I ask a question?	AtomikRadio	15	3	23	"I've not seen the show yet. (You're welcome to spoil episodes, though, I don't mind them and they may help answer my question better!)

I am a die-hard book fan and have been since I was young (probably too young to be in the proper age group to read them :P) to the point that I'm a criminal justice major because of the fascinations the books sparked in me.  I re-read them all once a year and Silence of the Lambs several times as often. Always a new sense of enjoyment. :)

As far as movies go I was moderately pleased with Manhunter and Hannibal Rising and extraordinarily pleased with Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Silence is my favorite movie of all time and a shining example of book-to-movie adaptations, in my mind. We won't discuss the atrocity that was the Hannibal movie adaptation. It is dead to me. DEAD I SAY.

And so I was excited but horrified to hear about this series when it was first announced. I've been so very curious but terribly wary of the show. It could be amazing or it could be Hannibal all over again. Of course the series wouldn't have a direct book to pull from but I'm still so worried they would destroy certain parts of canon. Hannibal is a complex character and often people are unwilling to give him that complexity, instead just wanting to turn him into a 2 dimensional horror figure.

I was brought to this subreddit by /u/Faustyna 's post in the AskReddit thread about TV shows and he/she said this:

&gt;Takes place before Hannibal Lecter's capture, and Bryan has plans for 7 seasons covering eventually Red Dragon, Silence, and the Hannibal book.

which was probably supposed to be exciting but to me it just smacked of opportunities to mess up canon and ""fix what isn't broken.""

So I'm wondering, from people who are longtime fans of the series/characters and *specifically* of the books, how loyal is the show to what Thomas Harris laid out?  Is the show made for [filthy casuals](http://i.imgur.com/yHOkff2.jpg) or is it true enough (and interesting enough!) to engage serious fans of Harris' works?

I mean, I'm reading the sidebar and it describes the show as ""seeing where the incredible story began"" but considering Hannibal's an adult in the show then this isn't even ""where it began,"" Hannibal Rising was where it began. So that kinda stuff has me worried.

Edited again to add:

More sidebar.

&gt;psychiatrist-turned-serial-killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. 

Wrong way 'round, unless they retconned his past in a very extreme way. He's a serial-killer-turned-psychiatrist, if anything. He had murdered many people before he finished school.

It's these things that I'm afraid of/asking about.

**TL;DR: Love the books more than is probably healthy. Worry over if the show will be true to canon has me avoiding the show. Is the show true to Harris' work or will it enrage me like Hannibal did?**"	t5_2vs7z	True
1368685680.0	1efr1a	A Lover's Concerto - Spoilers for Episode 08 Fromage	DangerCocktail	11	1	3	"The song that the cello student was playing in Tobias' shop was Christian Petzold - Minuet in G Major, which was adapted in the 60s by The Toys as 'A Lover's Concerto'.  

Lyrics:

    How gentle is the rain
    That falls softly on the meadow,
    Birds high up in the trees
    Serenade the flowers with their melodies .

    Now, I belong to you
    From this day until forever,
    Just love me tenderly
    And I'll give to you every part of me.

The song sets the stage for the ""serenade"", as Hannibal calls it, of the murdered orchestra member. I think Bryan Fuller might have enjoyed the double meaning of the song in both incarnations.  Bach gave the song to his second wife Anna which implies a serenade as well.

I don't remember the correct term right now, but I thought that when the skin on a severed limb wraps around the site of the separation (or the end- I'm not stating any of this very well-- sorry) it indicates that the limb was removed from a living body.  So one of the following must be true: a) I am misinterpreting what i see, b) I am incorrect about the meaning of such a finding c) I am correct but that aspect of the appearance was not deliberate in the show (after all, wouldn't have the forensic team have noticed?) or d) at the time the limb was severed Miriam Lass was alive.  Did they address whether or not the limb appeared to have been frozen?  I will have to watch that episode again.  But if it had been frozen, it would surely have shown signs.  So that could be the big thing I missed.  If so, my humblest apologies- do downvote the stup' n00b.    

I suppose (a) and (b) are most likely.  I think I got this idea from Dexter.  I've been looking and have found nothing in forensic medical literature to deny it, but nor has anything confirmed it.  Thoughts?  Corrections?  Education you can stuff in my brain hole?

1370509973.0	1fs4bd	Relevance of Episode Names to Content	QueenlyBellylaugh	9	1	1	"I'm not sure if I'm slow/unable to make connections (no mushrooms, ha!) or just haven't seen the reddit/tumblr post explaining this in detail, but I don't seem to understand why some of the episodes have the names they do. I would've dismissed it as arbitrary matching of a 13-course French meal to 13 episodes of Season 1, but some names have pretty cute inside jokes going on. Does someone have a link or better info? Excuse my Internet jigsaw definitions.

1) Aperitif- alcoholic drink normally served before a meal. (*Duh, it's an intro.*)

2) Amuse-Bouche- a single, bite-sized hors d'œuvre, ""amusement for the mouth."" (*I don't get it.*)

3) Potage- a category of thick soups, stews, or porridges, in some of which meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they form into a thick mush (*Anything I can think of is a stretch. Also, ew ew, soup is probably people.*)

4) CEuf- eggs, I think. (*Mothers lay eggs, which hatch children?*)

5) Coquilles- seafood or chicken dishes baked with a sauce and usually served in a scallop shell or a shell-shaped serving dish (*The shell dishes look vaguely like angel back-skin wings?*)

6) Entree- dish served before the main course, or between two principal courses of a meal. Also, a number in which the lead character or characters of a ballet make their initial appearance on stage. (*Hmm.*)

7) Sorbet-frozen dessert made from sweetened water flavoured with fruit, wine, and/or liqueur. (*Hannibal being all lonely was sweet. I think that was a stretch.*)

8) Fromage- uhhh, cheese? (*Tobias gets ded cause he's not a cheese person. I think.*)

9) Trou Normand- a small drink of Calvados (apple brandy from Lower Normandy) taken between courses in a very long meal, sometimes with apple sorbet, supposed to re-awaken the appetite. Well-made calvados should naturally be reminiscent of apples and pears, balanced with flavours of aging. The less aged calvados distinguishes itself with its fresh apple and pear aromas. The longer the calvados is aged, the more the taste resembles that of any other aged brandy. As calvados ages, it may become golden or darker brown with orange elements and red mahogany.

...(*Ew, all I can think of is aged/dried/browned humans in that corpse tower. But re-appetizer works too.*)

10) Buffet Froid- hot food is placed in a public area where the diners generally serve themselves. (*Unclear/no relevance.*)

11) Roti- roast meat.
12) Releves- follows another course like Hors d'oeuvre or Poisson (fish), but preceded the entrée. Things served in larger portion than or with heavier methods of cooking (braising, stewing, etc) than the entree are considered relevé.
13) Savoreaux- Something...delicious?

Typing all this, I'm not even sure if the names are supposed to be relevant or if I just really really want them to be."	t5_2vs7z	True

The first was in the premiere episode Apéritif, the recreation of the Overlook Hotel's Gold Ballroom Bathroom.  The red bathroom is cited by Hannibal's creator Bryan Fuller in an interview, ""What's so remarkable about it is it’s a purely psychological space. ... It’s like they dipped the entire set in blood. ... I understood watching it as a 10-year-old that this was psychological storytelling"".

The second reference is a nod to decay and rot.  Something appearing as healthy and vibrant but truly rotten and evil underneath. More to discuss once the episode has aired.

This raises the question: Is Will Graham a representation of Danny Lloyd and his ability to see the evil at the Overlook Hotel?  He has a unique gift set that allows him to enter a world no one else sees.  Rather than a person, it would seem that Hannibal himself represents the Overlook Hotel.  An evil entity wanting to take a savant's gifts, to be understood, truly seen, and empowered.  "	t5_2vs7z	True

Then at some point during the series they will realise someone is eating them. 

I noticed the mushroom thing a couple episodes ago, as he always mentions mushrooms as an ingredient when he's cooking.

Also it makes sense that he is 'contracting' people to do killing for him some of the time like Jacob-Hobbs, the phone call he made to him before they arrived at his house. But if this is correct, why are people killing *for* him and what grasp does he have on them?

If you find something I missed that blows apart any of my theories please let me know! I am genuinely curious as this is one of my new favourite shows and I am so glad it's been renewed. Okay, first my theories regarding the final episode. 

Abigail and Hannibal - Unless she is saved by someone unexpectedly it is pretty clear Abigail is going to die (it's been pretty clear from the start really, considering that anyone who seems to know the true Hannibal does not survive long). I think Hannibal will use her death to save Will from the suspicion that he has been slowly putting in place against him. If Abigail were to survive she is still a threat, but if she were to be framed for the other murders and then die herself that frees up Will completely and I bet it will be in a way that Hannibal is framed as some kind of hero which endears him to Will. 

Will and Hannibal - I think that Will is getting close to realizing what Hannibal really is and all of the things that he has missed, I think Hannibal will convince Will that the frame against Abigail is the truth and that somehow he missed it entirely, being that Hannibal is such a great manipulator Will is going to believe it at least for awhile. Questioning himself so thoroughly will undercut his suspicions about Hannibal allowing the wolf (hannibal) to remain in the henhouse unchecked for the time being. 

Alana and Will - I think that whatever goes down is going to be really intense, violent, bloody and scary. Whatever it is will in a way make Alana fear Will on some level. I think they will continue to dance around for awhile but it will come to nothing thereby opening the door for the character of Molly to enter. 

Season 2

Hannibal - I was curious to see if they would ""out"" Hannibal this season which I think they will not. I think Hannibal will be able to use Abigail to cover his tracks but because this wasn't his original plan this will put him on edge and the juggling will be a big story line for Hannibal next season. But I also think we will see much more of a chess match almost between Jack and Hannibal as Jack circles ever closer to the truth.

Will - I think the entire story line with Abigail will shake Will to his core and cause him to question his process entirely. I think he will continue to pursue something with Alana but because she has a bit of fear when it comes to him and what he is capable of it will force him to come to terms with the fact that he must embrace his abilities in order to be free of the weight of them. I think this will be his running theme for season 2. 

Jack - It's pretty clear that Jack is going to be the one to catch Hannibal but I think what we are going to see is that despite not really understanding what Will does he will have to identify with Will and use those tools to catch Hannibal. In many ways Jack will have to become Will in order to catch Hannibal, which mirrors Will's ability to become the killer to catch the killer. 

Dr. Du Maurier - I think she is going to cross paths with Will at some point. 

That's just off the top of my head, do you guys have any theories on where things will go next season? ps. mind the grammar and spelling this is all off the cuff.

1371218166.0	1gc5wk	[Spoilers] This is my design for the season finale	slyfox1908	4	0	1	"(This is all fantasy, but it's a spoiler in that it begins where last night's episode ends.)

The episode begins in Minnesota. It is very still. A police officer enters the house, calling for Will Graham and Abigail Hobbs. He finds Abigail in the kitchen, her throat cut. She has bled out. The camera pulls away to reveal that the blood was drawn into the shape of antlers around her--the killer stayed to watch her die. He pulls out his radio and requests a call to Jack Crawford.

Opening credits.

Will, back home in Wolf Trap, is wrestling with what happened in his lost time. He hallucinates a conversation with Abigail (who has antlers), before she is replaced by Garrett Jacob Hobbs and, finally, Hannibal. SWAT storm Will's house--apart from his dogs, it is empty.

The BAU team, in Minnesota, recover Will's fingerprints from the kitchen. They relay this information to Jack, back in Virginia. Alana is with him.

Will has gone to Hannibal's house, distraught from the lost time, to confess that he has lost Abigail and does not know what happened to her. Will breaks down in front of Hannibal, beginning to rave. In his ravings, however, he starts to put together the pieces and realizes that Hannibal has the same connections to the copycat killings that he has. He accuses Hannibal. For his part, Hannibal argues that Will has committed the murders in his periods of lost time (the same theory he gave Jack), and that accusing someone else is a defense mechanism.

Jack has reasoned that if Will is not at home, he has gone to see Hannibal. He and Alana hurry there. Alana has difficulty believing Will is the killer.

During the conversation, while Will is distracted, Hannibal attempts to knock Will out. He fails, and the two begin to fight, destroying Hannibal's dining room and kitchen in much the same way Tobias destroyed his office.

Will knocks Hannibal down and grabs a knife. He raises it high to stab him and Hannibal reflexively shields his face with his left hand. The blade cuts deep into his palm.

Jack's SWAT team rush in with their guns drawn. Hannibal is between Will and the door so they do not shoot, ordering Will to drop his weapon. He does so, falling to his knees, the world spinning.

Jack reads Will the murders he is charged with, beginning with Abigail's. With his worries regarding Abigail's fate confirmed, Will bursts into tears. Alana leads Hannibal away, holding his left hand in his right. Both his hands are covered in blood.

The pendulum swings once and the season ends.

Coming in season 2:

* Hannibal, the expert witness at Will's trial, gets him declared not guilty by reason of insanity.
* Will is committed to the same mental hospital as Abigail. She joins Garrett Jacob Hobbs in haunting his dreams.
* Jack checks Will out of the hospital like a library book.
* Freddie Lounds, who was right about Will, gains the respect of the BAU team.
* With Will committed, the copycat killings stop. The Chesapeake Ripper, on the other hand, continues killing.
* Hannibal's hand injury gives him difficulty cooking, causing him genuine frustration and anguish."	t5_2vs7z	True

So I've watched through episode 8 and I have some theories that I would like to discuss.

Potential SPOILERS BELOW (I tried the spoiler text format and it didn't seem to work for me. Sorry.)

I think Will might be killing people as he's losing chunks of time. It would kind of fit with his hypnosis style pendulum style of assessing a crime scene and would also seem to fit how he's always right. Is Hannibal controlling him through drugs and hypnosis as well as other forms of manipulation.
I think Jack might end up being fed Bella. Hannibal has made several comments regarding his keen sense of smell and that he knew someone had stomach cancer before he was diagnosed. He also commented Bella's perfume and let's assume he knows she has cancer and it seems he's been feeding all his guests people all along. Seems likely that somehow Bella's cancer and Hannibal will cross and him eating or feeding her to someone else seems as if it would have a 'holy shit' factor for viewers and it seems twisted enough for a season finale type thing.
*Will at some point has to end up being a killer. His mind is slipping, he relates but the writers are going to have to tie him and Hannibal together in a ""we are a like"" fashion to move forward. He discovers Hannibals secrets and then perhaps Hannibal blackmails him by revealing things he has made Will do or knows of Will.

""If Hannibal lived in Canada, he'd be cured.  I mean, he only eats the rude, ...right?  He'd starve in Canada.""

Don't know if this has been already discussed, or if it's pretty obvious but in my opinion, Will's visions of a deer is somehow related to Hannibal.
It's like the subconscious is trying to communicate him that Hannibal is evil but his conscious blocks the idea, because of their friendship, and that generates the visions.

The stag is a metaphor for Hannibal and his first murder, the copycat case.

Now i dont know if this is a urban myth that i have picked up from Its Always Sunny and Book of Eli.

Did any of you also feel like sometimes Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" was cited? IMO there are two setpieces that are pratically identical to scenes/places from Kubricks film: The iconic red bathroom where Jack and Will talk early on in the season mirrors the place of action in ""The Shining"" where Jack Torrance and Delbert Grady talk during the party. Then there's the greenish bathroom later on where Will finds a murder-victim. This mirrors the setpiece in ""The Shining"" where Jack Torrance has his episode with the scary old bathtub-lady.

And in the latest episodes he has experienced sleep walking and general time loss. My prediction is that FBI in the final episode find some sort of storrage in Will's backyard, where he has placed a dosen of dead bodies. All the dead people have then been killed in all the different ways, the killers he has used his empathy skills on, has killed (?). In other words there will be a totem of the people, a man who can be played on, a girl on an antler and so on.. and so on..
