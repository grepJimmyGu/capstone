It started with making black bean burgers, just because I love black beans. I've noticed I really like, well, just about everything vegetarian I've ate so far.

The only problem is, I grew up in a pretty normal American household and don't have a clue about basic, easy, staple-ish vegetarian recipes.

Though, I'm not really looking to ""replicate"" an omni diet, (I barely eat meat as it is, so I'm not going to be missing it or anything) I just want some ideas for tasty things.

So what do you eat fairly regularly, the sort of thing you can knock out pretty quick and have a tasty meal?

1 14-ounce package extra-firm, water-packed tofu, drained
1/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/3 cup lime juice
3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil

Pat tofu dry and cut into 1/2- to 3/4-inch cubes. Combine soy sauce, lime juice and oil in a medium shallow dish or large sealable plastic bag. Add the tofu; gently toss to combine. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour or up to 4 hours, gently stirring once or twice.
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Remove the tofu from the marinade with a slotted spoon (discard marinade). Spread out on a large baking sheet, making sure the pieces are not touching. Roast, gently turning halfway through, until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Yield 8 Prep Time 20 minutes Cook Time 70 minutes

**Ingredients**

1/4 cup olive oil

1 chopped onion (medium)

1 stalk chopped celery

2 chopped carrots

1 cup pearl barley

1 1/2 cups brown lentils (dry)

1 1/2 liters vegetable broth

1/4 teaspoon thyme (dried)

1 teaspoon parsley (dried)

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1 bay leaf

4 cups sliced button mushrooms

1 tablespoon dry sherry

**Instructions**

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook and stir until they are limp but not brown, around 5 minutes. Mix in the celery and carrots and cook for another 5 minutes. Stir in the barley and lentils so they are coated with oil and continue cooking until lightly toasted. Pour in the veggie broth and season with thyme, parsely, pepper, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes over low heat. Add button mushrooms and cover and cook for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Optional: Mix in sherry during the last 5 minutes.

Ingredients:

* 2 Garlic cloves (minced using a garlic press or finely chopped)
* 3/4 Large Onion (finely chopped)
* 1 tomato (diced)
* 1/2 red bell pepper (diced fine)
* 1/2 yellow bell pepper (diced fine)
* 1 baby eggplant (diced)
* 1/2 zucchini (diced in quarter pieces)
* 1 cup of mushrooms (diced)
* 1 cup mixed veggies (carrots, peas, corn niblets)
* 1 box of Lick's Nature Burgers mashed (If you don't have those you can use any veggie burger, or ""yves veggie rounds"")
* 10 large potatoes 
* 1/2 pack shepherd's pie seasoning (read the labels to make sure no meat product used)
* 2 table spoons of masala spice 
* 2 table spoons of butter or margarine
* 5 - 8 spoons of mayonnaise (depending on your tastes, you can also use greek yogurt, or sour cream)
* Salt 
* Pepper
* 2 Dried chili peppers cut up (use less or none if you don't like a kick)
* 4 - 6 table spoons of Milk (you can use soy or almond milk - add more as necessary for the consistency you need)
* 2 table spoons olive oil
* Kettle of boiled water (to add as you cook to avoid burning / drying)
* 1 egg (whisked &amp; beaten)



Instructions

Top half of your pie - potatoes:

* First peel &amp; dice the potatoes into small pieces so they cook fast
* You should fill the pot you will cook them in with cold water and add the potato pieces as you chop them.
* Once you have your pot filled put it on the burner on high heat until the potatoes are cooked.
* You can over cook them a little because you are going to mash them.
* Once Cooked make mashed potatoes using the milk, butter/margarine, salt, pepper and mayo (or yogurt/sour cream).
* Make sure the potatoes are mashed well they should be soft and fluffly but not runny.


Bottom half of your pie - the rest

* Use medium heat on a large sauce pan on the stove with the olive oil
* Throw in the chopped garlic &amp; onions 
* Throw in the salt &amp; pepper to your taste 
* Throw in the tomatoes 
* Throw in the seasonings (shepherd pie seasoning and masala spice)
* Throw in the cut up dried chilies if you are using them. 
* Add the following veggies first: bell peppers, and mixed veggies.
* Add your mashed nature burger patties (or other proteins used)
* Add all other veggies now eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms etc
* Add small amounts of water as you need to avoid burning, sticking, or drying
* Once the veggies and ground patties/veggie ground are all cooked up turn your heat down to minimum and let it simmer for a little bit to achieve a slow cook taste.

Making the pie 

* Get your large corning ware dish or casserole dish and put the veggie cook-up in the base ... fill as much as you can depending on the potato-to-veg ratio you want.
* Take your mash potatoes and put them on top in spoon dollops 
* Smooth down the potatoes over the veggie cook-up.
* Use a cooking brush to lightly brush the egg over the potato to hold it together and brown
* Use a fork to lightly go over the smoothed potato to make pretty lines for presentation and to help you use these guidelines for cutting later.
* Bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees F with foil on top of your pie.
* Remove the foil after 30 mins and place back in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes to brown the top depending how brown you want it.
* After the pie is cooked let it stand for 20 - 30 minutes before cutting and you can serve this up with veggie sides or whatever you want to serve it with.
* Note: Do not cut immediately after taking the pie out the oven because it will be a runny mess.

Enjoy.

I hope that this is the right place to be posting, if not, feel free to direct me somewhere else, but I am interested in a cheap and reliable way to make tasty vegetarian meals quickly. One burning question: If I started cooking most of my meals regularly, would I still be able to go to the grocery store about once every two weeks? Otherwise, just give me what I might need to get started.	t5_2ru7e	True

Tonight, I made an amazing dish of Lentils and Rice with Fried Onions, and was looking for any other simple lentil dishes people might have. This recipe uses green lentils, but I actually have a lot more red lentils than green.

Anyway, here's my recipe from tonight to start it off:

1 1/4 cups green or brown lentils, rinsed and sorted
1 very large onion, cut into 1/4 thick rounds
6 tablespoons olive oil
salt and pepper
3/4 cups rice


Heat the oil in a skillet, and throw the onions in. Cook at medium heat, stirring frequently, until they are a rich dark brown. About 10-12 minutes. Set aside when done. Meanwhile, put the lentils in a large saucepan with a quart of water and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat until it boils, then simmer for 15 minutes. Then add the rice and plenty of pepper to the saucepan, add water to cover if necessary, then cover and simmer on low heat on for another 15 minutes (or until the rice is cooked). When that's done, add half of the onions to the lentils and rice, take off the heat, cover and let sit for 5 minutes. Serve on plates and add the rest of the onions on top. Serves 4-6."	t5_2ru7e	True

* 1 Can of chickpeas 
* Plain flour 
* 1/2 Medium onion
* 1 tsp Ground Cumin
* 1/2- tbsp curry powder
* 1-2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
* 1 lemon
* Sunflower/Vegetable oil

**Method:**

1. Drain chickpeas and put into a bowl, either use a potato masher or hand blender to turn into a paste (I like prefer to use a masher as it leaves some whole and half chickpeas which gives the burgers a nice texture)

2. Add chopped onion, coriander, and spices and stir thoroughly.

3. Add the zest of a whole lemon and the juice of half.

4. Add a small handful of flour (1/4-1/2 cup), as you stir this in the mixture should start sticking together, add more if you feel it's necessary.

5. Shape into patties and shallow fry in your oil for about 4 minutes/until nicely brown on each side.

6. Remove from the pan and leave on a piece on kitchen roll to allow any excess oil to drain off.

Enjoy!

Edit: One can of chickpeas makes about 6 medium sized burgers

First i would like to thank this subreddit for it's great culinary contribution to my diet. 

A group (which I am a part of) have recently come together to construct a nonprofit cooperative cafe; The goal is providing a free space from both social and political pressure where art and dialog can evolve (we are Palestinians).


Recently we have reached the food issue. We did not receive authorization for gas stove / cooker and will thus only use electric one. Also we prefer to work with local farms and thus will mainly have access to mediterranean flora. (yes, [palestinian beer exists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taybeh_Brewery))  

While vegetarian the menu won't be vegan!

Do you have any suggestions beyond a plate of cheese &amp; olives / pasta ? something that can be cooked using an electric stove perhaps? what vegi snack would **YOU** like beside your beer?  

Thank you all in advance for your contribution.    

----------------------------------------------------------------edit-----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the great idea; just to clear something up:
1. Bonus points for simplicity this is more of a pub than a restaurant.
2. While the signature palestinian foods like humus and falafel are great they simply do not suite (do not sit well with alchohol / too smelly for a place with an indoor bookshop).  

Btw, pm me if you are ever in haifa and would like a good vegy burger."	t5_2ru7e	True

I'd love to have a recipe for this so I can make it at home for myself. Does anyone have the recipe or a good close one that they like?

1326122285.0	o9cfl	Vegan Latkes and apple sauce		36	4	3	"**For the latkes you will need:**

1.5 pounds of russet potatoes

1 medium yellow onion

1 tablespoon of parsley 

.5 teaspoon of baking powder

1 teaspoon salt

.25 cups flour

pepper to taste

oil for frying (I recommend Canola or soy bean oil)

add ons:  you could add garlic or rosemary to this recipe and it would fucking rock.

Peel the potatoes, and grate them into a collander.  Skin and grate the onions, and set aside, but not with the potatoes.  Mince the parsley, set aside.  Combine all powder ingredients and set aside.

Squeeze the shredded potatoes in the collander to get out as much liquid from them as possible.  This will make them cook faster and hold together better.

Coat the bottom of a skillet with your cooking oil, and put on medium heat.

Once they have been squeezed, put them in a mixing bowl with the onion, parsley, garlic / rosemary, and mix well by hand.  slowly stir in  
the powder ingredients.

once everything has been mixed in, take globs of the mixture (size is up to you, thickness is non-negotiable), roll it into a ball, and flatten it out, then add to the skillet.  it should take about 4 minutes per side, but it should be brown when it is done cooking- you be the judge.  when you remove each round of latkes from the skillet, they will be pretty oily.  put them on paper towels, newspaper, etc. to soak up some of the greasyness.    

**For the apple sauce:**

8 good sized apples

enough apple cider to cover the bottom of your pan about 1/4 inch deep

1 lemon

cinnamon to taste

Peel and core the apples, cut them up into larger or smaller chunks depending on how chunky you want the final product to be.

pour the cider into a pan, add the apples and bring to a low simmer.  Keep simmering for ~45 minutes.  stir occasionally- if it is still really chunky, you can start mashing as you stir.  when you have the desired consistency, remove from heat, add 1/4 of the lemon's juice (or to taste) and the cinnamon.  let cool, then chill before serving.

NB's:  
The apple sauce will thicken up more as it cools.  be aware of this when judging consistency. 

It's best to use a more sour apple than you would ordinarily eat.  Cortlandt, rome, mutsu, winesap, and rhode island greening are all good for this recipe.  If you think it is too tart at the end, you could add a little maple syrup, but add it sparingly. "	t5_2ru7e	True

I got the idea for it from Momofuku by David Chang. In this, instead of using bacon, shiro (white) miso is used instead. Amazing! Sorry that my recipe isn't quite exact.  

Ingredients:   

* Linguine
* Butter 
* Shiro (white) Miso
* Garlic - a few cloves, minced
* Parsley
* Parmesan

Mix 5 tablespoons of the buter with 4 tablespoons of the miso. Set aside.

Start cooking the pasta as per directions on your package. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute the garlic in about a tablespoon of butter or olive oil. When the pasta is nearly al dente (but slightly underdone), transfer to the pan with the garlic, and add miso butter until well coated. Crack an egg or two in, and stir violently to coat everything in the egg (before it scrambles!). Toss in a splash of pasta cooking water to loosten the sauce, and serve with parsley and parmesan (if desired)."	t5_2ru7e	True
1373147545.0	1hrpwi	Quinoa with steamed veggies and white wine sauce [v] / optional [d]	NyQuil012	34	4	9	"Ingredients (makes about 4 servings):

   * 1 cups quinoa, rinsed
   * 2 cups vegetable or mushroom broth
   * 1 tsp olive oil
   * 1/2 vidalia onion, chopped
   * 2 cloves garlic, chopped
   * 2-3 oz white mushrooms, sliced
   * 1/2 cup white wine
   * 1 tsp fresh oregano, chopped
   * 1/2 tsp fresh thyme, chopped
   * Salt and pepper to taste

   * (optional) 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

   * Assorted fresh veggies: I used about half a zucchini and half a yellow squash, cubed, 2-3 carrots, chopped, and some leftover corn cut off the cob. Feel free to substitute broccoli, asparagus, snow peas, sprouts, celery, whatever you like. It should amount to about 2 cups all said and done.

In a medium sauce pan, toast the quinoa over medium heat for about 5 minutes to dry it, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Add broth, bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-13 minutes, until quinoa is soft, stirring occasionally.

While the quinoa is simmering, take a splatter shield  (the mesh kind works best) large enough to cover the sauce pan and cover the quinoa. Place the veggies on top and cover with a bowl large enough to cover the whole thing. Allow the veggies to steam for 10 minutes or so, until tender, stirring occasionally to ensure they cook evenly.

In a small frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium/low heat. Add onion, saute until it turns clear, about 3-5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for another minute. Add mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms begin to release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, until the wine reduces to half. Add oregano and thyme.

When quinoa and veggies are soft, mix them together in a bowl. Add the mushrooms, onions, wine, and cheese, mix and serve. "	t5_2ru7e	True

Anyway this is a cross-post from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/d9ok9/is_anybody_else_addicted_to_ph%E1%BB%9F/), based on [mmmberry's](http://www.reddit.com/user/mmmberry) recommendation.

******
The broth: I usually triple it. You can just freeze what ever is left over, since it takes about three hours to make (although if you make less it take less time).

*1 leek, just the green part (5-6 green onions work too)

*1 yellow onion, quartered

*1 shallot, halved

*4 garlic cloves, halved

*1 inch fresh ginger, cut into medallions

*5 Star of anise pods

*2 3-inch cinnamon sticks

*4 whole cloves

*1 bay leaf

*32 oz vegetable stock

*8 cups water

*soy sauce to taste

*1 Tablespoon sugar

*Step 1: Put leeks, onion, shallot, garlic, ginger, anise, cinnamon, cloves and bay leaf in a (very) large pot. Sear (high heat) them for 5 min.

*Step 2: Add the vegetable stock and water. Bring to a rapid boil, and leave it there for 8 minutes. Reduce heat to simmer, and leave for 45 mins.

*Step 3: Remove leeks, add sugar and soy sauce (salt and hoisin sauce work in addition to the soy sauce). (It needs quite a bit of salt/soy or hoison sauce, so don't be scared you're putting in too much).

*Step 4: Run the broth through a strainer. Keep the broth, discard everything else.

The meat: 

*1-2 Tbs Oil

*leeks (or 5-6 green onions), the white part cut into ~1/4 in. sections 

*8 oz Shitake mushrooms

*10oz can of [mock duck](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Wheat_gluten_%28vegetarian_mock_duck%29_opened_can_%282007%29.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://benmyersmanofletters.blogspot.com/2010/01/mock-duck.html&amp;usg=__7-d-Lkdf4306_clkbAm6vfvliYA=&amp;h=1518&amp;w=996&amp;sz=949&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=ZmPjxib9UKjy8M:&amp;tbnh=130&amp;tbnw=87&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dmock%2Bduck%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26biw%3D1211%26bih%3D594%26tbs%3Disch:1&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=106&amp;vpy=71&amp;dur=5230&amp;hovh=277&amp;hovw=182&amp;tx=94&amp;ty=131&amp;ei=JCuDTOKCGYeosQOlpcj2Bw&amp;oei=JCuDTOKCGYeosQOlpcj2Bw&amp;esq=1&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=19&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0) (save the juice)

1368116798.0	1e0bwk	Some kind of tuna sandwich replacement?	thenewmeta	33	3	46	"Firstly up front, I would not classify myself as a vegetarian. However, my meat intake is really, really, low. Partly because it just kind of grosses me out half the time, partly because I hate handling and cooking it, partly because, my god I sound like a vegetarian in denial.

But I still LOVE tuna sandwiches. To the point that I realize I shouldn't eat the amount of tuna I'd like to eat because of its mercury content. 

I typically make the magic mix with a can of tuna, some mayo, mustard and salt and pepper. And recently I discovered an even tastier combo (maybe just for me, I love garlic), of a full bulb of roasted garlic mixed with two cans of tuna and the aforementioned mixture. Once I made this, I realized I had a problem because I just want to eat this. Just this. This will do for the rest of my life. But, thats not really going to work out for me.

So, has anyone come across a good tuna sandwich equivalent? I wouldn't say I'm looking for a fishy taste, more so the texture and ability to take flavors well."	t5_2ru7e	True

(Super easy AND vegan) 		35	6	20	"i make this all the time because they are so easy to put together and a really good way to eat a bunch of kale (both are good with either kind of kale), which I'm obsessed with. The nice thing is you don't really have to follow a recipe, and you can substitute a lot of different things to accommodate what you have in the fridge. Plus, both have a lot of protein from beans.

**Asian kale pasta salad**

Boil some whole wheat spaghetti until about 2 minutes before it's al dente, add a bunch of kale and cook for remaining time or until kale turns bright green.  Run under cold water to stop the cooking and shake dry. Combine in bowl with minced garlic soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds and rice vinegar, to taste (red pepper flakes optional). Toss with diced vegetables or shelled edamame. Done! Can be made in large quantities because it gets better over time.

**Kale and white bean pasta.**

Boil pasta (I like the ear shaped ones for this). While boiling, saute a bunch of kale with garlic and oil, until kale is soft. Toss pasta, kale, and white beans in skillet. Garnish with salt, pepper, lemon and fresh parmigiana cheese (omit cheese for vegans).  Serve immediately.

I make homemade nut milk, but never had anything to do with the leftover ground nuts once the milk was pressed out. I just made it into chorizo, burgers, and falafel and it's all fucking marvelous. Use more seasoning than you're comfortable with. Then after you've seasoned everything, add more.


Nut Milk: 2 cups mixed raw nuts (I like cashews, almonds, and a small amount of peanuts -- must be raw). Cover with cold water and soak over night in the fridge. Strain. Put into the blender, cover with 1-2 inches of cold water, blend. Strain through fine mesh strainer, then through cheese cloth. Add a little vanilla and a little simple syrup or agave.


Chorizo: Combine ground nut-leftovers with 1/2 can of black beans (strained and dried as much as possible), rehydrated dried shitake mushrooms, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves of garlic, some tomato paste, a little vinegar. Food process. Bake on low heat, then freeze for an hour to remove excess moisture. Mix in *lots* of cayenne, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, cumin.


Burgers: nut grounds, whole onion, 2 cloves of garlic, red bell pepper, rehydrated dried shitake, tomato paste, a little worcestershire. Food process, bake, freeze. Add a little baking powder, cumin, oregano, black pepper, celery salt, smoked salt (if you don't have this, get it!) or [Bacon salt](http://www.baconsalt.com/). Right before cooking, add bread crumbs and an egg yolk (or agar if your vegan). Cook on a charcoal grill (preferably).


Falafel: nut grounds, 1/2 onion, 3-4 cloves of garlic, chickpeas. Food process, bake, freeze. Add bulgar, fresh parsley (lots), fresh cilantro (a little), salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes (a tad), a little baking powder, some flour. Fry in grapeseed oil."	t5_2ru7e	True

* 1 Packet of red lentils 
* 1 Can tomato puree
* 1 Grated carrot
* 1 Grated zucchini 
* 1/4 tsp Mixed herbs
* 1/4 tsp chili powder 
* 1 Clove garlic finely crushed
* 1/4 Onion
* 1 Cup gluten free breadcrumbs (can make from scratch in a food processor from gluten free bread or some stores sell ready made ones. Or you can even use crushed corn flakes.)

**Method**

- Boil lentils until tender. Drain water.
- Mix together boiled lentils, tomato puree, grated carrot, zucchini, herbs and spice.
- Sauté onion and garlic in a little oil. Add to mix.
- Form into patties and coat in breadcrumbs (if mixture is too sloppy add in some breadcrumbs to mix.) 
- Fry or BBQ in a little oil until crispy on the outside and thoroughly cooked on the inside. (You can also grill them to make them healthier.)

I just made these today, got the recipe off my mum. 

Hope someone else enjoys :)

What are some good recipes for lunch that aren't just standard lettuce based salads or involve quinoa or have fake meat/ tofu. I'm willing to put in the time to cook so I don't need fast or simple but I want good things to eventually add to my regular diet.

Thanks for the help!

1316460185.0	kkrql	Yummy Vegetarian Sushi	thatsweetembrace	33	5	6	"Hey all.  I made some vegetarian sushi this afternoon that I'm pretty proud of, so I decided to share.

It came out pretty well, sorry for the [shitty pic](http://i.imgur.com/kRMw7.jpg).

Here are the ingredients I used: [http://i.imgur.com/uDcNP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uDcNP.jpg).

Anyhow, here's what I did.

**Do up the rice**

I put a half cup of organic sushi rice into my rice cooker.  When it was done I stirred it around a little bit, and added a pour of rice vinegar.  I also added a half-handful of white sesame seeds.  I let it cool for 20 mins while I prepared the other shit.

**Prep the stuff you plan on inserting into the sushi rolls**

Cut everything into strips.  I used cucumber, celery, carrot, avocado, and some sprouts.  This should be simple enough.  Veges are great, but you know what will really make the sushi awesome?  Yam fried in batter.  It's fucking delicious, trust me.  I cut the skin off of the yam and then diced it into small pieces.  Then I boiled the little yam pieces for like 5-10 mins to soften them.  Then I made up [this](http://www.philamfood.com/images/T/shirakiku-tempra-bttr-mix-10oz_tn.jpg) Tempura Batter Mix and dunked all the little yam pieces into it so they were coated really good.  Last, I fried these batter-soaked yam pieces in a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil.  I put all of my fillings aside.

**Roll up your sushi**

You are going to need a sushi mat and sea-weed wrap (called Nori).  Make sure to wet your hands so the rice doesn't stick to them, and then apply your rice to the Nori leaving about an inch margin on the tops and bottom of the seaweed wrap.  Pro-tip:  wrap your bamboo mat in Saran Wrap so you don't have to wash it. Roll it up [like so](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/63/223929430_e3697ac82d.jpg).  It's really not too hard.

**Flavor it up**

I got some pickled ginger, wassabi, soy sauce, and made some spicy mayo by combining mayonnaise with cock sauce (aka Sriracha sauce).

**ENJOY**  (Green tea = optional)

**Ingredients:**

Sauce- 

* 2 tsp oil
* 2 Cloves of minced garlic
* 1 tsp chili powder (less for a milder flavour)
* 1 tsp curry powder
* 4 tbs brown sugar
* 2 tbs shredded coconut
* 2 tbs gluten free soy sauce
* 2 tbs lemon juice
* 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
* 1 cup of water

Directions:

1. Fry garlic, chili powder and curry powder in oil until garlic is browned. 
2. Add the fried spice mix to a large saucepan and add all other ingredients (dry ingredients first, mix, then add wet ingredients.) 
3. On a medium heat bring to boil and stir until thick. 

 Serve with grilled firm tofu (well pressed, drained and patted with paper towels), rice and whatever vegetables you like (I usually just heat up a mix of frozen veggies.)

1277174805.0	chkme	can we use tags like [vegan], [eggs], [dairy], [honey] please?	amewnorian	28	5	12	"I'm sure all the vegans in this subreddit would appreciate being able to scan quickly to see which recipes are vegan.  And, specifying which non-vegan ingredients are involved would be useful for borderline vegans and lactose intolerant individuals.  I wouldn't recommend vegan/vegetarian tags because some people are willing to eat certain animal products and not others.  For example, technically honey isn't vegan, but I'm sure plenty of people who don't consume eggs or dairy have no problem with honey.  So, specifics on what non-vegan ingredients is preferred.  Please post any other tag ideas you would like people to use :)

I took this recipe, and I completely excluded the fish sauce. What this did is make the paste that you rub on the napa cabbage thicker. But WOW!!!! Holy crap, this is really good tasting stuff. I started eating it right after it had sat for an hour.

2-3 cans chickpeas

1-2 cans plain diced tomatoes

1 can coconut milk (optional)

1) Get your rice started cooking separately.

2) Mix first four ingredients over medium heat.  Allow onions to thaw if frozen or soften if fresh, and allow curry to mix and get paste-ish. 

3) Add in chickpeas, tomatoes, and coconut milk.  Let it come to a boil, then lower heat, cover and simmer for 10ish minutes.

Delicious!  Claims to feed 4, but was more like two hungry people with a little left over for somebody's lunch tomorrow.  Serve with toasted croutons or crusty French bread.

* 2 large onions, sliced into rings
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 to 1 1/2 tsp yeast extract (I used 1 1/2 tsp of vegemite; marmite would probably also be fine)
* 1 quart (~1 liter) of veggie stock (I used two veggie bouillon cubes in 1 qt boiling water)
* 1 cup (240 ml) red wine (I used a cabernet sauvignon)
* 1/2 tsp sugar (optional; I didn't use any)
* olive oil
* salt and fresh ground black pepper

In a heavy soup pot over medium heat, saute the onions with a little olive oil.  When the onions are getting soft, stir in the garlic.  Pour in enough stock to cover the mixture and cook for 5 minutes.

Pour in the rest of the stock and add yeast extract to taste.  Add the wine, plenty of fresh ground black pepper, and sugar if using (I didn't find it necessary - ended up getting some sweetness from the wine).  Simmer covered for an hour, pausing in the middle to salt to taste (I probably used 1/2 tsp or so). "	t5_2ru7e	True

I usually just throw things together to have for dinner and lunch the next day, so you don't have to follow this recipe exactly.  It's just a general ""jist"".  In any case it's pretty hard to screw up!  The only thing not gluten-free about this recipe is the pasta, which you can change at will!  Brown rice pasta goes great with this.  Serves 2.
 
Ingredients:

* 1 cup soy milk or other milk substitute
* About 1/2 cup daiya cheddar cheese [gf]
* ~ 3oz dry whole wheat/brown rice shells or elbows
* ~ 1 T cornstarch
* ~1/2 t - 1 t crushed red pepper
* ~ 1 T mustard powder
* some salt (1/4 t) and very small amount of black pepper

In a medium saucepan (preferably non-stick) cook the milk until hot (not boiling).  Add daiya and spices, and cook until melted.  Add cornstarch until you like the consistency -- once you're happy, add the cooked pasta and stir in.  The idea is not to thicken the sauce with the cheese but with the cornstarch.  I've made it by using only the daiya to thicken and it's far too rich (though some might like that, just add daiya until you're happy).

Pumpkin Lentil Curry Soup with Kale
Recipe yields 5-7 bowls

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can pumpkin puree or equivalent fresh
- 1.5 L veg stock
- 2 cups water
- 1 can whole or crushed tomatoes
- 1(ish) cups red lentils (I eyeballed it using one coffee mug's worth)
- 1 1/2 tsp curry paste
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin
- salt to taste
- 3 generous handfuls chopped kale

1. Heat a large pot and add the olive oil and minced garlic. Sauté  until it is lightly browned - watch carefully to make sure it doesn't burn! Add the pumpkin puree, vegetable stock, water, crushed tomato, lentils, and spices.

2. Reduce heat and allow to simmer until lentils are soft, stirring occasionally. Add the kale and cook an additional 5-10 minutes. Serve and enjoy!

This soup is really easy and good as is - but would probably benefit from some onion (added before/with the garlic in step one) and perhaps some carrot (ditto).. That's probably how I'd make it next time. Let me know how this soup turns out for you :)"	t5_2ru7e	True

Feel free to play around with the quantities as they're not really set in stone and were really only equated from rough guesswork. The main thing is just to have everything in a similar ratio. Just thought I'd share :)

50 g soft tofu

50 g green cabbage

90 g Soba noodles (1 serving)

4-6 Shitake mushrooms

1-2 Tblsp of hot chilli sauce

1 Tblsp of Miso Paste

300 ml of water


Slice the 50 g green cabbage and 50 g shitake mushrooms into small pieces. Boil 300 ml of water (or however much fills your bowl).  Add the tablespoon of miso paste and stir in, adding any more as necessary.  Add the cabbage and mushroom to the water, cooking on medium heat for 15 minutes. Slice the tofu into small pieces and add to the soup along with the soba. After 3 - 5 minutes (or whenever the soba tastes cooked by) turn off the heat and pour the soup into a bowl. Leave to cool for 1-2 minutes. Add the hot chilli sauce to taste. 

This is a good source of protein from the soba (complete protein), tofu and miso and also contains a lot of iron from the mushrooms. Soba is a plus as if you buy in bulk it can be very cheap but extremely nutritious (I found a 1.8 kilo pack for AUD$10, roughly 18 servings) so it removes the incentive to take the 2-minute noodle/Mi Goreng route.

1300164057.0	g464x	New to the vegan thing		24	3	32	"Hello fellow Redditors! 
I am looking to start a vegan diet on the 23rd of this month, I want to try it out for 30 days and see how it goes for me.  Since I am looking to lose weight I would like to stick with a fully vegan diet and not include any meat if possible.

So what does all this have to do with you?  I am here today asking for some good beginner recipes, they need to be easy to prepare and not require a lot of outlandish ingredients.  I am going to do my best to eat local organic foods but I live in the interior of B.C so besides hothouse veggies I may have to go for imported stuff :(
Anyways, if you happen to have some good, simple recipes you can recommend, it would be greatly appreciated.  I am on a fixed income and so do not have a massive food budget but I am positive there is a way to eat healthy on a budget, despite what my local grocery stores want me to believe.

Thanks for any and all help you can offer.  "	t5_2ru7e	True

1296699713.0	fe7sj	Amazing Vegan Rice and Beans Recipe		23	4	11	"you will need:

2lbs Green Bell Peppers

2 Lbs Yellow Onion

10 Cloves of Garlic

1 pound dried black beans OR 3 cans worth of black beans

Spices / condiments:

Olive Oil

Vegetable Butter (Nature Balance)

brown sugar

chili powder

Cumin

Salt

Pepper

you want to start off by making Sofrito.  do this by finely chopping up all the onions, peppers and 6 cloves of garlic, adding 1/4 olive oil, and cooking in a skillet on high for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.  after 10 minutes, turn the heat down to low and cook for another 45 minutes.  add salt and pepper 10 minutes before you are done cooking.  this will make a shit load of Sofrito.  you will not use all of it for the rice and beans, but it goes well with most everything, so leftovers are not a problem.

if you are using canned beans, rinse them thoroughly and set aside.  if you are using dried beans, (they will have had to be soaked for 8 hours before you start cooking) put them in a big pot with 5 cups of cold water, bring to a rolling boil, then reduce heat, and cook until you can smush them between your tongue and the roof of your mouth.  drain them.

once drained, put the beans in a large bowl and mix in as much Sofrito as you want to use.  it's totally up to you, but i used about 1-1.5 cups.  add to the beans / sofrito mixture:

1/2 teaspoon ground Cumin

1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar

1 1/2 teaspoons Chili powder

salt and pepper to taste

for the rice, you want to cook 2 cups of rice in 3 cups of liquid.  for the liquid, i used 2 cups veggie stock, 1 cup water.  you should mince the remaining 4 cloves of garlic, and add them to the cooking rice.  also put in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a big pat of veggie butter, and salt.

This is really good as a side or as a main dish, it goes especially well with the sauteed Kale recipe that i am about to post to r/vegrecipes with the title ""Spicy Sauteed Kale""

Enjoy."	t5_2ru7e	True

* 2 cups boiling water
* 2 14 ounce cans of tomatoes (i use margaret holmes tomatoes corn and okra)
* soy sauce (i like kikkoman's)
* hot sauce ( i like tapatio)
* 1 cup of leftover rice (chinese food leftovers are perfect)
* ketchup and mustard (i usually like seedy mustard , but for this application cheapo yellow is best

Reconstitute the TVP with the 2 cups of boiling water and add the 2 cans of tomatoes. Heat on medium high while stirring the rice in. Season to taste using the hot sauce and soy sauce , but don't get carried away. When the mixture is hot enough to serve , add ketchup and mustard till the consistency and color makes you hungry(or to taste , whichever happens first).

If you serve it on vegan bread , i THINK this is vegan. I like it on kaiser rolls with muenster cheese however.

Here is my brother's recipe for vegetarian mexican lasagna. Next time I make it I will send pics.

mexican lasagna

to serve ~3-4 and a few leftovers

ingredients:

* about 20 corn tortillas
* 1 can black beans
* 1 small can diced tomatoes
* 1 very small can tomato paste
* 1 can black olives
* 1 can corn OR 2 ears corn
* 1 onion
* 1-3 bunches of spinach
* 1 block cheddar cheese

optional:

* ancho peppers
* jalapeños
* garlic
* 1-2 packages ""soyrizo"" not sure why but it just fits


I've never tried this with real meat but that could work also

Chop up everything except the tortillas and spinach.

Mix together the beans, tomatoes &amp; paste, olives, corn, diced onion, and (optionally) chopped peppers, chopped garlic, and soyrizo in a big bowl.

In a large glass baking dish, make layers of first tortillas, second bean/tomato mix, and third spinach. Repeat until you can't fit anymore in the dish. (top layer can be the wet bean/tomato mix to avoid the tortillas and spinach getting TOO crispy on top)

bake at 350-400 for 30 minutes or until the end of the world, to taste. Longer times mean the flavors blend together better but the spinach will be mushier consistency and tortillas will be crunchier on the top.

Top with avocado, cilantro, sour cream, hot sauce.

I mostly ate at my university's cafeteria and improvised something for dinner. Now it's not as feasible to do that because for schedule reasons I'd rather eat at home.

The thing is, I'm sick of pasta! It's far too easy to just put together pasta with whatever I have around. These past few months I've been living off pasta (being careful to get all my nutrients, of course) but I'm getting kind of sick of it.

I basically need suggestions of what to make, preferrably quick 'n' easy things (though I love challenges on weekends). I don't have any requirements - I'm not completely vegan yet though I try to eat vegan - except that I hate mushrooms. In my country, meat/egg/etc substitutes like vegetarian sausages, etc are a bit more expensive and, especially, pretty limited in comparison to the US.

1297882864.0	fmn9z	Awesome Vegan Kale and Potato Enchiladas		18	1	12	"For the Chile sauce you will need:

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 onion (diced)

3 large green chiles (roasted, seeded, peeled, choped)

2-3 teaspoons chile powder (ancho is best)

1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin

1 teaspoon Epazote (mexican oregano)

1 28 oz can diced tomatoes with juice



For the potato and kale filling you will need:

1 pound potatoes (yukon gold or red)

1/2 pound kale washed trimmed and chopped finely

3 tablespoons olive oil

4 cloves garlic, minced

1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

1/4 cup vegetable broth

3 tablespoons lime juice

1/4 cup toasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds)

Salt to taste

you will also need 12-14 corn tortillas


Preheat the oven to 375

in a heavy sauce pan, over medium heat, saute the onions in oil for 4-7 minutes until softened.  add the remaining sauce ingredients, bring to a simmer, and remove from heat.  when the mixture has cooled enough, taste, and add salt to taste.  then puree in a blender until smooth and even.

for the filling:

peel and dice the tomatoes, then boil them until tender (~20 minutes)  drain and set aside.  cook the olive oil and garlic in a sauce pot over medium low heat stirring occasionally until the garlic is sizzling and slighly browned ***don't overcook the Garlic***  add the kale and sprinkle in a little salt, raise the heat to medium, keep stirring to cover the kale with oil and garlic, partially cover the pot to steam the kale until it has wilted (4-6 minutes) 

remove the lid and mix in the potatoes, vegetable stock, lime juice, pumpkin seeds, and salt.   with a wooden spoon, mash some of the potatoes.  cook another 3-4 minutes until the stock is absorbed, add more salt and lime juice to taste.

have ready the following: a pie plate filled with 3/4 cups of the sauce, a casserole dish, a stack of corn tortillas, and a lightly greased heated, cast iron skillet.

ladle a little bit of the sauce into the bottom of the casserole dish and spread it around. put a corn tortilla on the skillet for 30 seconds per side until it is softened.  flop the tortilla into the casserole dish and flip it over to completely soak it in the sauce.  then fill the tortilla with the potato and kale filling, and roll tight.  place all the wrapped tortillas next to each other in the casserole dish, layer if necessary.  dump about a cup of the sauce over all of them, saving some sauce for later.  cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 25 minutes.  remove foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the edges of the tortillas sticking out of the sauce are slightly browned.  top individual servings with more sauce, warmed slightly.

Enjoy.

I've been vegan for two and a half years, but lately I've been trying to step away from soy excess (particularly the nasty overly-processed types). My goal would be organic tofu/tempeh once of twice a week. And I can't go crazy with seitan, because my boyfriend has digestion issues, and though he's fine with bread and pasta and such for the most part, a big dose of straightup wheat gluten tends to make him a bit sick. I of course know lots of protein rice grains, beans and veggies, I'm just looking for some new exciting ways to assemble them. Thank you!

Making excellent salsa is simple and easy if you know the pitfalls to avoid. As a long time connoisseur of fresh refrigerated salsas, I reveal to you today, my secrets of making delicious salsa. Here is the list of ingredients, explanation to follow:


Makes 8 cups

1 28-oz can of whole tomatoes (I prefer Muir Glen organic fire-roasted)

1/2 green bell pepper

1/2 white onion

1/4 bunch of cilantro

5 cloves of garlic

1 jalapeno pepper add/or 2 habanero peppers (depending on spice tolerance)

1/4 to 1/3 cup white vinegar

1tbsp chipotle powder

1tsp cayenne pepper

salt and brown sugar to taste

optional: dash of caraway seeds and rosemary



First, add the green pepper, onion, garlic, jalapeno and habanero peppers to a 8-cup or larger food processor. Pulse until contents are coarsely chopped. Next, add spices, white vinegar and the entire contents of the canned tomatoes. Pulse lightly. Finally, add the cilantro (I use stems and all) and blend until desired consistency is achieved.

Notice that I have not used any fresh tomatoes. A common mistake is to reach for the fresh tomatoes thinking they'll make your salsa even better. Not true. If you only use fresh tomatoes, you will end up with something resembling pico de gallo every time. The canning or stewing process inherently changes the flavor of the tomatoes. Using high quality canned tomatoes like Muir Glen organic is certainly one of the biggest deciding factors in how good your salsa will taste.

Also, I have intentionally *not* used apple cider vinegar. While I love cider vinegar in many other recipes, I have found that it does not produce a good flavor in salsa. The tomatoes and fresh veggies are the stars of your salsa, not the vinegar. Stick to white vinegar so that the taste stays in the background."	t5_2ru7e	True

1326949574.0	omtp0	A list of important/versatile ingredients to always keep around the house?		17	2	17	"Hey everyone,

I was thinking it would be cool to come up with a list of important/versatile ingredients to keep around the house to that you can always put together something yummy at a moment's notice.

There are so many great veggie recipes out there, but a lot of them call for unusual ingredients, or just have a long list of ingredients. Also, for those of us on a tight budget, even if we had the time to always go shopping for new ingredients, it's hard to afford buying that much variety. 

So, if you had to choose a short list of the most important ingredients for vegetarian cooking to always have on hand, what would they be?

And don't say things like bread, eggs, butter, salt &amp; pepper, because I'm assuming people generally have these things around. 

For me, here are some versatile and important things I keep around (other than the usual stuff): 

* Quinoa (quinoa salad, pilaf, put on green salads, breakfasts, etc)
* Orzo pasta (easy warm or cold pasta salad)
* Lemons (dressings on salads, quinoa, or pastas)
* Tomatoes (salads, pilafs, sandwiches)
* Spinach or other dark green (salads, sandwiches, steamed, pizzas)
* Celery (snacks, pilafs, salads)
* Tortillas (great for making wraps, quesadillas, burritos)
* Pita bread (great for snacks, wraps, making personal pizzas)"	t5_2ru7e	True

The texture is much thicker and firmer then seitan would be. It's sliced about 1/4 inch thick in large chunks. And they have dark and light colored at the one restaurant and refer to it as chicken and beef.  The stuff is fantastic.

After trying different ways to recreate the texture with different seitan methods I gave up and asked them what they used. They told me it was Soy Chicken and could be purchased at Asian markets.  I've checked a few and have never found it, I've searched online and can't find it either.  I would like to be able to purchase or make this from scratch.

1 can crushed tomatoes (I prefer fire roasted)

Can you recommend a cookbook that fits these criteria?

* Uses not too many ingredients and cooking equipment (preferably less than 5 ingredients and no more than 2 pots or pans)
* Doesn't use too many unusual ingredients (I'm too poor to constantly go to the store for a random ingredient I might not use that often)
* Optional but very preferable: has color pictures :)
* Has recipes that don't take longer than 30 minutes, preferably under 15 minutes. 
* Has a good number of vegan recipes

1322978841.0	mzid4	Roasted Almond Hummus	anythingtwice	15	3	7	"I eat a **lot** of hummus.  If you do too and are looking for something a little bit different, here is an idea that you might like to try. This is how I have been making hummus recently and I don't think I'll go back (until I get bored again and try something new).  I apologize for the lack of specific measurements.  I never use them.  I eye-ball everything and adjust to taste.  Plus everyone likes their hummus a little different (more/less lemony, more/less garlicky, etc.)  Don't let that stop you from trying this.  Enjoy!


**Roasted Almond Hummus**

Ingredients:

* garlic cloves, peeled
* olive oil
* whole almonds
* canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans) with liquid
* tahini (sesame paste)
* lemon juice
* salt


Directions:

* Roast almonds on a baking sheet in the oven (say 350) until fragrant, shaking the pan occasionally.  I like to let mine go until they are quite dark, but be aware that they get more bitter as they darken (they take on a roasted, almost burnt taste, like coffee has).  Let cool.  I tend to roast large batches and keep them in a plastic container so that I can skip this step when I want hummus.

* Combine garlic, and as little oil as you can get away with in a food processor.  Process until the garlic is chopped.  

* Add almonds to the the garlic and oil already in the food processor.  Process until thoroughly ground (may take a bit).  Once the mixture has the texture of ground coffee, begin to drizzle small amounts of additional olive oil into the food processor as it operates.  The additional oil lubricates the mixture and allows the almonds to break down even more.  It should look like dark brown sludge (like you sometimes find at the bottom of your coffee mug).

* Open the cans of chickpeas and drain, reserving liquid.  Add chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and a bit more olive oil (not too much) to the food processor.  Process, drizzling reserved liquid as the mixture combines.  The longer you process it, the smoother it will be.

The final product has a nice, roasty nutty flavor that goes nicely with the garlicky/citrusy/salty flavors of hummus.  It's also a nice way to make hummus taste a little more like autumn.  The two keys of the recipe are to process the almonds long enough that you don't have ""chunks"" and to use the reserved chickpea liquid (rather than olive oil) as the main wet ingredient.  With the almonds, the mixture can be a bit drier than normal hummus, so there's a need for more than liquid than normal.  But olive oil tends to give the hummus a weird texture.  Sometimes it will ""break"" and look like soft cheese.  The reserved chickpea liquid gives a **much** more pleasant texture."	t5_2ru7e	True

2 cups non-dairy milk

2 teaspoons white vinegar

1 teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon baking soda


Start off by mixing the ""milk"" and vinegar in a small bowl.  one mixed, let them sit for 5-7 minutes.  (adding an acid to the milk in effect creates buttermilk) during those 5-7 minutes, preheat the oven to 425, and lightly oil the bread pan.  mix the salt flour and baking soda in a big mixing bowl.  once the buttermilk has been created, mix it into the dry ingredients.  stir it and fold it enough so that all ingredients are mixed, but don't overdo the stirring.  the dough should be very sticky.  plop all the dough into the bread pan and with a small knife carve a cross into the top of it. (it's to help it rise don't get your atheist feathers all ruffled) place in the oven for 40-45 minutes.  when you take it out, if you knock on the bottom of the loaf, it should sound hollow.  

this bread is especially good fresh out of the oven (let it cool first) and hosed down with as much Nature Balance or other non-dairy butter as you can pack onto every square inch.  enjoy.
