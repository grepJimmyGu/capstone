- License code under MIT and assets under CC BY-NC

- Add Chang's sprite. He still isn't playable

- Add the torch, bartender, and dealer to the tavern

    You can't interact with them yet, but they move!

- Add bottles and pots to the tavern.

    You can't smash them yet.

- Add the overworld

    Before entering a level, players will find themselves in the overworld.
The overworld is still a work in progress. Sprites currenly don't walk
under trees. You also currently can't get back to the overworld.

- Add daybreak as the pause music.

    I also refactored how audio is handled. You'll notice that the main
level track will replay it's much more often now. This bug is intended
until we get each level's individual music.

- Bump release version to v0.0.16

- Change britta-bot post template

- Add a minimum framerate. Pause the game when not in use

    Many people complained of falling through the floor at odd times. A
minimum framerate fixes these things. However, the game might now feel
'slow' for some users on lower-end computers. There isn't a better way
to fix this, so apologies in advance.

    The game will now pause when it loses focus. No more getting attacked by
hippies when you minimize the window.

- Add consistent level music. No more fading in and out

- Add version file for release notification

- Add a bunch of costumes.

- Refactor jump code.

    You'll no longer be able to jump while in midair. If you are still
experiencing problems jumping, please report a bug.

- Add an ending screen

    Since the game isn't finished yet, you'll now see a ending screen once
you leave town. Press space, return, or escape to go back to the select
screen

- Bump release version to v0.0.13

die.

Sorry that it's been so long since a release. I've finally found more time to
devote to the game, so expect releases to happen once a week (just like old
times). No crazy exciting features today, but we did add new enemies to Gay
Island. Hope everyone had a great holiday!

&gt;— Article II, Section 3 of [Reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette)

**Present**

The subreddit and game are stronger than ever. We have a very high online user
count for subreddit of our size.  People have been adding amazing stuff to the
game, all on their own. I've been pulling in new features from others every day
for the last two weeks. It's a great feeling.

With all this development, the game has become less stable. When you keep
adding so many features, performance and stability are bound to suffer. What
are we going to do about it?

**Future**

My focus for the next weeks will be first on performance and then gameplay.
This means there may be some large changes coming around the corner. To make
sure we hear your feedback, we'll be moving to fixed release schedule.  There
will be a release every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 10AM. This schedule
allows us to get feedback from you on a regular basis and also gives us time to
fix bugs between releases.

Now that we have such amazing levels, we need to fill them with fun and
interesting gameplay. Some gameplay was featured on the show (boss battles,
inventory, weapons, and poker) and some we've created all ourselves (hidden
levels, blackjack, and raves). I'll be working closely with the
story-development team to figure out how we want to game to progress after you
beat Cornelius. 

Every since I started the game, I've been conflicted about how we should
structure levels and level progression. The original game featured in DEP is a
hybrid platformer-RPG and I think we need to do more to embrace the RPG side of
the game. To fix this, and better integrate the newly-designed levels, the game
is going to switch from a Mario-style overworld map to a Zelda-style persistent
world. This change allows us to have some areas that are structured differently
(such as the black caverns) along side open-world areas like the Greendale
campus. A persistent world also allows us to properly replicate the
transformation of the Town into New Abedtown.

The overworld artwork is fantastic and won't be going away. We'll be
using it as a map you can access from your inventory. While the game is
in development, this map will also allow you to warp to other locations.

**Puppies**

At 5,000 subscribers, I promised to [live-stream a puppy
parade](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/vfuxs/congratulations_we_have_5000_study_group_members/c547jdp)
if we got to 10,000, and I intend to keep that promise. However, puppies aren't
cheap and I don't intend to opening a shelter anytime soon. Instead, I'll be
live-streaming the [Burlingame Pet Parade](http://www.burlingamepetparade.com)
on September 29th. If anyone is in the area, we can make an official meetup out
of it. More details as the date gets closer.

That's it for now. Thanks for making this the best subreddit around.

1339038963.0	up69e	State of the Subreddit: 2300+ subscribers and so much more	Derferman	163	17	36	"Wow, what an amazing few weeks it's been. When I committed my first line of
code I had one character, a single room, and jumping didn't even work. A short
18 days later, the subreddit has over 2300 subscribers, over 70 people
have contributed to the project, and the game has been downloaded over 16,000
times. I never imagined the game would be this popular, and things are just
getting started.

As you may have seen today, a couple of sites (IGN, Slate, AV Club, Verge) posted
articles about the game. Donald Glover tweeted about it as well. Many of
you are probably wondering how things are going to change now that the secret
is out. In my mind, nothing has changed. I'm going to focus on bringing you
guys a release every few days, and I hope you continue to contribute to the
game and the community .

I'm so grateful for the costumes, pixel art, gameplay, testing and everything
else that all of you have provided. Your time and energy are greatly
appreciated. This game would be nowhere without you.

I don't know what the future holds, but this is definitely not the darkest
timeline. I can't wait to see where we are in another two weeks. 

Winger speech over.

I'll be posting a new release tonight that fixes some of the worst bugs and has
some of the awesome new costumes we've seen over the last two days. :)"	t5_2u5zi	True

**This is a new section that will appear in every release. It gives me and the
other devs a chance to explain what's in the new release.**

Welcome to another release of Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne. I know it's
been a while since our last release, but the devs and artists have been hard at
work. The biggest changes are the new HUD and changed controls. 

The new HUD shows off your lives, coins, health and current character. I'm
really happy with how it turned out. 

Next are the updated controls. The game is now meant to be played with an NES
controller. jhoff has been playing it with a Wiimote with great results. If you
have any feedback, post it below.

This release also has [a bunch of new
costumes](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/pull/469).

Thanks for sticking around and being part of the best subreddit around. You
guys seriously rock.

when community first came out it looked like it would be a pretty cool show. it was fun, it had a consistency that was lacking in most other shows at the time, but it was more then that. I know for me, a seventh semester community college student, that this show was taking one of my favorite places ever, and showing me why I loved it. that was the number one reason I liked this show. but now its more then just that. 

I'm sitting on my couch right now, listening to the hawkthorn demo ending music and thinking to myself; we've become a community. the fans of this great show have done more banding together then any show ever has. community has truly lived up to its name. and we cannot let it die. its rare to find a good show these days, but even rarer to find one that raises the bar for what good is. and I believe that this is just that show. so tell your friends, show them what they're missing out on. lets do our part to keep this community going.

There are several links at the side of the page that will show you things like FINISHED and NEEDED SPRITES, COMPLETED and WIP CHARACTERS and COSTUMES, a list of 8 BIT SONGS that have already been included, and the STORY DEV WIKI which will show you all the story discussion that has happened so far.

There have been many ideas flying around and making the front page a bit messy. Here are some tips, upvote so more users see this or downvote if you disagree with these:

If you are proposing a NEW CHARACTER of COSTUME, please go to the COSTUME SPREADSHEET to make sure your suggestion has not already been listed.

If you are suggesting a NEW SONG that should be included in the game, go to the MUSIC TO-DO SPREADSHEET to see a list of songs that have already been included.

If you have a new idea for the STORY LINE, a MINIGAME suggestion, or anything else that could pertain to game flow of any sort, go look through the STORY DEV WIKI. There has been a lot of story development already and your idea may already be there.

If everyone checks these places first, this page will be less redundant and more full of helpful submissions!

TL;DR Please, please look through all the links at the right side of the page before submitting any ideas. Many have already been pitched.

**FROM THE DEVS**

It's that time again folks, another new version of Journey to the Center
of Hawkthrone. We've finished the transition to the new sprite sheet
layout, so now all characters use the same layout! A huge thanks to
everyone involved, especially /u/edisonout, for getting this to the
completion line. Now that we have the sprites, digging and crawling are
closer than ever.

We also have two new costumes, Hobbes troy and Ameridean.

We've connected more levels together and also updated the first
cutscene. Since we just changed **EVERY** costume, please download and
play test.

Enjoy!

PS: While we now have the blacksmith sounds and sprites, he hasn't made
it into the game just yet. Close!

Many Windows users are finding they can't open the game, getting a ""Cannot set write directory"". We're working on figuring out what's causing the error.

**FROM THE DEVS**

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! We wanted to get this release out in time for the holidays
so you enjoy some Hawkthorne with your turkey. Every once in a while, we make a release
that adds a bunch of new stuff. This is one of those releases. We have a new part to the forest,
a new hurt animation, a familiar face is back in town, and best of all, weapons have finally been added. 

You can make weapons using crafting. Here are the recipes. Note, this probably won't be how you get weapons in the future,
but it's what we have now.

    mace   = rock + rock
    mallet = rock + leaf
    knives = rock + stick
    torch  = lead + leaf
    swords = stick + stick

I've saved the best news for last. Many of our OS X players haven't been able to enjoy the game
for more than a few minutes. The audio would start to lag and then the game would freeze up. I'm 
excited to announce that we now have a better version of our framework, and that issue won't happen anymore!

With so many changes, there are bound to be plenty of bugs. Please report them in the comments.

1338158548.0	u7ucj	[RELEASE] Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne v0.0.4	britta-bot	135	23	79	"**CHANGES**

- Fix automation tools

    The Makefile had the wrong version for uploading new changes. The
version script can now get previous version numbers. Minor changes to
the cityscape psd.

- Fix error with automatic submission to subreddit

    I'm now using requests and my own code to interact with the Reddit API.
Much easier and less error prone.

- Recreate opening logo

- Add Jeff as a playable character

- Clean up character flashing code

    Flashing is now done using a periodic timer. This fix will prevent
characters from getting into a state where being invulnerable still
allowed them to get hit by an enemy.

- Add Troy as a character

- Add Shirley as a playable character

    Note that her jump animation is not correct. I'll need to refactor
everyone's jump animation in three states: up, down, landed. Most people
have the same for all three, but Shirley has a different down and landed

- Fix version script

- Bump release version to v0.0.4

It's been a while since our last release, and I wish I could say that this
release is packed with new features. Sadly, this is just another bugfix
release. We do have one awesome addition, which is the new 'flyin' animation
after character select. I hope you guys like it. 

So, what are we working on? Two things: refactoring code and gameplay. Right
now the code base is a bit of a mess, making feature development hard. Our plan
is to clean up the pain points so that we can get back on schedule. Once that
process has been finished (to an extent), we'll start work on game play.
Weapons and additional levels are next on the todo list.

I know some of you would like us to go faster, but game development is tough.
Thanks for sticking with us. We develop for you, the fans. Keep those bug
reports and feature requests coming in.

You are probably wondering why there hasn't been a release in the last few days. I've been working on completing the official sprite sheets (which is no easy task). I'm almost there, but need your help to finish. Here are the current sprite sheets. 

- [Britta (2 more)](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/britta.png)
- [**FINISHED** Abed](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/abed.png)
- [**FINISHED** Shirley](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/shirley.png)
- [**FINISHED** Pierce](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/pierce.png)
- [**FINISHED** Jeff](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/jeff.png)
- [**FINISHED** Troy](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/troy.png)
- [**FINISHED** Annie](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/raw/master/src/images/annie.png)

You'll also notice that there is no default layout for sprites. I did this because each character is very different.

Sadly, some animations will not make the first release. Actions such as sliding, digging, and shooting lighting were scratched due to time.

**Where you come in**

We have 10 animations left to finish. Let's do it. Most of these are for Pierce. [Sign up on the spreadsheet and get to work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhXdsqGjvkjPdE1aN1lrNTU3QW5Wb3Q4NFZhUF9ZV2c#gid=6).

**EDIT**: Final stretch, only 2 more to go!

If you have any questions about the sheets, ask them in the comments. Happy spriting!

directions.

    Annie's walk animation is now correct. Remove many unused images from
the psds directory.

- Add Britta as a playable character

- Add Pierce as a playable character

It's Monday, so you know what that means Greendaliens, RELEASE TIME! We've
cooked up an awesome release today with some major new features.

jhoff completely rewrote how floorspaces work. Any room that is 2.5d now
supports jumping and walking **behind** objects. We've tested this thoroughly,
but there still may be some bugs.

**The default controls have changed**. We know that many people aren't going to
like them. We're working on adding customization, but for now, please don't
complain about them. The new controls are:

- MOVEMENT: Arrow Keys
- JUMP: Space
- ACTION: Left shift
- INVENTORY: v
- START: Escape

Lastly, you should go to the town and try to climb up the ladder. :)

Happy Hawkthorning!

of Hawkthorne][post] over in /r/community. Since then, we've amassed 12,700
awesome subscribers, released 78 versions of the game, designed 206 costumes
(that's more than the Dean himself) and had over 350 people help us with with
the game.

This game is truly community powered, and we couldn't be where we are today
without all of you. A huge shout out to the mods and developers who've helped
take my original idea and make it a reality. Also, a thank you to everyone in
the subreddit for your continued play testing and support.

I'd like to keep this post upbeat, but not all is well in the land of
Hawkthorne. Our daily unique play numbers are down from a high of 1500 players
to only [60 a day](http://i.imgur.com/VdnPpTT.png). Our subreddit is drawing
less than 1000 unique visitors a day. Many features seen in the show [still
haven't made it into the game][missing]. The more traffic we get, the easier it
is to attract new contributors, which make it easier to do more things!

So, what are we doing to get people playing the game again?

- A strict two-week release schedule. There will be a new release every second
  Monday at 9am. The features for each release will be tracked and decided on
  right after the previous release, so the devs always know what we're working
  on.
- Focus on missing elements from the show instead of original content. This
  means that levels like Gay Island and Valley of Laziness will see fewer
  updates as we work on adding Gilbert fights, cutscenes, and boss battles.
- An emphasis on testing, so that it's easier for us to make changes without 
  breaking the existing game.
- Retooling the interface to make the game easier to navigate.

I don't mean to be all doom and gloom. We're a strong community and I have no
doubt that next year, when the time comes around to post another one of these
threads, that our game will be kicking ass. It's been on hell of a year, and we're just getting started.

In honor of our one year anniversary, post your favorite Hawkthorne memory or Community animated gif in the comments. Also, each of you have a task today: introduce one new person to Journey to the Center of Hawkthrone. Give the gift that keeps on giving.

Hello fellow hawkthronites! Today's release is quite exciting. We now
have savepoints in the game. You'll see statues of Cornelius' head
around the game. Just press UP or INTERACT and you'll be able to save
your game. When you die, you go back to your last save point.

Enjoy! As always, reports bugs in the comments.

1345095252.0	yb1c0	[STATE OF THE SUBREDDIT] 7,000 Strong and Growing Everyday	Derferman	114	11	15	"Greetings everyone!

Since we just passed 7,000 subs (crazy, I know), thought I would take the time to do a quick write up on current and future plans for the game.

First off, as always, I wanted to thank all you awesome people for helping with the project. The artwork, music, code, and testing help that everyone here has provided has made the game possible. Without you, the game wouldn't have gotten off the ground.

Let's talk about current plans. I've gotten many messages from people eager to help out, but never sure where to start. To make sure we're on the same page, you can help out by

- Testing every new release and reporting bugs
- Contributing to the Story Dev WIKI
- Creating new levels and sprites for the game
- Creating Sound effects

All of these efforts are needed. We've been using a spreadsheet to organize most of this, and it's worked out pretty well. However, now that game is more mature, the spreadsheets are becoming unwieldy. Therefore, I'm going to be switching over to using Github issues to track all bugs and features. This means that if you're interested in helping out, you can just go to the [issues page](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues?labels=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open), find a bug or feature you'd like to work on, and get to work. Once you're done, just open a pull request and the code will be merged in.

If you need feedback on a costume or sprite, please submit it to the subreddit. The feedback process is working really well.

And now, the future. With much of the music and artwork done, I'm going to be shifting my focus to making Journey to Center of Hawkthrone feel like a real game. Currently, you can just run around levels. I'm going to be working on adding enemies, NPCs, and actual gameplay. Hopfully, the game will start to feel more like an actual video. There will some follow up posts in the future about how you can help with this effort.

That's it for now. Feel free to ask any questions you have in the comments.

**EDIT**: Wanted to mention that we hang out and chat in [#hawkthonre](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hawkthorne) on freenode. Come join us.

With this release, Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne is officially one year old. Thoughts and reflections about our milestone are in the [one-year anniversary thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/1ep406/state_of_the_subreddit_celebrating_one_year_of/). We've got a huge release for everyone and I hope you enjoy it.

## Changes

- **Automated error reporting:** No more posting images of stack traces in the subreddit. The game will automatically report problems in a central place so we can fix them quickly
- **Game save management:** Select which game save you'd like to use, and delete old saves
- **Redesign HUD**: Simpler design and larger health bar.
- **Lightning and Arrows**: You can finally shoot lightning and arrows. Check the comments for instructions on how this works.
- **A more faithful overworld**: You can only travel to areas you've seen. Green flags show up when you've completed an area.
- **Costumes:** 39 new costumes (almost all from one person) I can't even keep track.

The last two weeks we focused on fixing many small issues with the game. Info boxes now open more than once. Platforms should be more consistent across all levels. Your visited levels will now be saved (woohoo!). Enemies will now flash red when they've been hit, which more closely matches the episodes. On the costume front, we've added costumes from Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and Greendale Babies.

* Castle Hawkthorne levels! ( props to didory123 )

To make the costume process move faster, I've created the [online Hawkthorne Costume Tester](http://hawkthorne-costume.herokuapp.com/). This site allows you to easily preview your costume and make sure that it's in the correct format and looks good.

Going forward, please submit costumes to this subreddit as links to the costume tester instead of just imgur. An example link looks like so:

&lt;http://hawkthorne-costume.herokuapp.com/abed/http://imgur.com/gJzqk.png&gt;

The page also has a reddit submit on it that will make the submission for you.

Some characters (Chang, the Human Being, etc) aren't on the website yet. For now, continue to submit costumes for those characters like normal.

And if you're ever confused about how to create a costume, please read the [Costume Creation Guide](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Costume-creation-guide).

Edison out.

Another week, another release. We've finished up some major refactoring, so we
really need people to download and play. We've also added a game over screen
and a new version of the Valley of Laziness. The game over screen doesn't use
the ""Lost the Game"" track yet, but will soon.  Enjoy this release, it's like
your own personal October 19th.

Okay, I lied to you all. This wasn't as hard as I thought, mainly because I had so many inter*chang*able parts, so I was able to copy/paste the facemask and claws from a whole sheet I made.

I thickened the antennae slightly from my first draft, so they'd have a much better feeling of movement when he ran (looked too flimsy first time 'round)

I put this into the spreadsheet under a yellow highlight. This needs a testing for sure, though. I did my best to line up the mantis-claws with the hands on the regular Jeff sprite, but it could still use a double-check to make sure the weapons are staying put. (If it's not perfect, but still ON the claw, I don't see a problem - we can just say it's attached to the claw-barbs.)

attend the [#sixseasonsandamovie Art
Show](http://pixeldripgallery.com/2012/05/six-seasons-and-a-movie-press-release/). I got to meet Community super fans and artists, and show off the game to anyone who would listen. Everyone who played the game was blown away. 

**Highlights**

- [Geneva](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4313223427457&amp;set=oa.357799467613565&amp;type=1&amp;ref=nf) playing the game as Annie in the Gevena costume #metameta
- Gillan Jacobs telling me that the squirrel costume was her favorite (shout out to Octocycle2)
- [Sakari Sangh](https://twitter.com/#!/Sakarisingh) and [Rachel Long](https://twitter.com/#!/ririnmetric) [playing the game](http://instagr.am/p/MPdy2KpqMQ/). Sakari was the artist behind most of the levels, and Rachel was one of the main animators for the episode.
- Sunday's soundtrack being powered by our awesome musicians (BoobATron4000, EvilTimmey, etc.)
- Meeting Dan Harmon (I had to suppress my inner Community fanboy)

**The best part though?** Being able to tell everyone that the game has over 100 contributors. People couldn't believe it.

I just wanted to thank all of you again for all the hard work and dedication. This game wouldn't be possible without you

*group hug*

**Announcements**

I just released version [v0.0.25](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/vmamm/release_journey_to_the_center_of_hawkthorne_v0025/). It's a small release containing full versions of some costumes. I'll be focusing this week on leaving the town and entering the black caverns.

Come join us on IRC in [#hawkthorne@irc.oftc.net](http://en.irc2go.com/webchat/?net=OFTC&amp;room=hawkthorne).
If you've ever had any questions for me or anyone else on the team, now's your chance.

That's all for now, and keep up the great work!

&amp;nbsp;

##~~Why should I help?!?~~
---
~~Good question. We are doing this project for 2 reasons: 1st, we needed to create a master layout for all sprites so they could scale better. 2nd, we wanted to add crawling, digging, punching, kicking and sliding to everyone for consistency, so they can be used in cutscenes and regular gameplay.~~

~~/u/edisonout and several others have done an amazing job so far. So much so that the sheer volume of work they've done makes my brain hurt. They could really use an extra hand. If we just had a handful of people jump in to help get this done, we could be done in a matter of hours.~~

    Added costumes include
- Abed - Alien
- Abed - Batman
- Abed - Joey

Hi everyone, /u/jhoff484 here, doing my first release thanks to /u/derferman's amazing new release process. I hope everyone is prepared for this whole project to go down in a ball of flames now :) ( kidding )

Sooo many changes in this release... I'm excited to finally able to dedicate more time to /r/Hawkthorne and I decided to celebrate it by merging as much as possible apparently. We have Jive turkeys, a few new levels, ladder fixes, floorspace fixes, control changes and a bunch of bugfixes. I hope everyone enjoys!

Important control changes:
- Doors have been changed back to UP ( or L/R in some cases )
- To go down a ladder, you have to double tap DOWN and hold

If you take a look at all those GitHub issues, you'll see one thing in common: they all have a link to getsentry.com.

[Sentry](http://www.getsentry.com) is a service that ""notifies you when your users experience errors in your web and mobile apps."" Whenever Hawkthorne crashes, we now get a bug report. Before, that crash might have never been reported, meaning we couldn't fix it. Armed with this new information, we can fix long standing bugs that we didn't even know about it, making Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne more stable, and more fun to play.

Huge thanks to Chris and the Sentry team for giving us an unlimited account free of charge. 

If anyone knows of other services that might sponsor us, feel free to send the moderators a message.

**Character Creation**

First character, creation. We've seen some awesome characters over the last few
days (Magnitude, Dean Pelton, Chang), but I have some bad news. While these
character sheets look awesome, many of them are missing necessary sprites to
make them work in-game. 

To prevent this happening in the future, I've written the [Character Creation
Guide](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Character-creation-guide), which details all the necessary sprites (with pictures) a custom character needs. I
understand this will create more work for character creators, but without these
sprites, your character can't be included in the game.

You may be wondering why some of these sprites are on the list. For example,
none of the current characters have attack, crouch, or hurt sprites. This leads
me to my second point.

**Finishing the Main Characters**

Big thanks to Drook for pointing out that the majority of our character sheets
are incomplete. If I wanted to implement crouching or attacking today, I
couldn't. This is where you come in. I've added all the missing sprites to the
[Sprite To-Do
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhXdsqGjvkjPdE1aN1lrNTU3QW5Wb3Q4NFZhUF9ZV2c#gid=0).
If you can, please help out. The missing sprites are highlighted in red.

Huge shout out to Ohsin who completed the [Annie sheet](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/blob/master/src/images/annie.png).

**Calling all audio masters**

I'm sure you're sick of hearing the same level music over and over again. I am
too. If you are musically inclined, please help us remaster in-game music. You
can find what music we need created (with examples) in the [Audio To-Do
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhXdsqGjvkjPdE1aN1lrNTU3QW5Wb3Q4NFZhUF9ZV2c#gid=2).

**Level Creation**

Sprites, audio, and writing not your thing? Now you can help out with level
creation. The guide is still a bit rough, but take a look over the
[Level Creation Guide](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Level-creation-guide).

EDIT: Finishing the character sprites will be my number one priority. The sooner they get done, the sooner I can focus on making more levels.

* (1) [a small admin building hallway at the first door, connecting a records room, college registrar, and any other miscellaneous locations](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/admin-hallway.png) (this also has the trophy case, college board pics on wall, and hopefully a lights out rave version (in progress now). UPDATE: still working on rave/lights.
* (2) [Borchert hall](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/borchert-hallway.png)    
* (3) [classrooms, first floor](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/class-hallway-1.png)
* (4) [classrooms, second floor](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/class-hallway-2.png) - entrance at right end.
* (5) dorm hallway (maybe [a very small lobby](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/dorm-lobby.png), with a hallway only for Abed's floor). I'll work on this after admin hallway. 

I think the North Cafeteria and the Maintenance buildings make more sense to open directly into rooms, rather than have a hallway. 

I am still trying to think of some animated bits to make the levels seem more alive. I plan to add Fivel the mouse to one of the classroom hallways and plan to add students walking around (as with all campus areas) but if you can think of other small animated items that might fit, please comment.

Hope you like it so far. 

UPDATE: sorry, I noticed I left the node layers on, so you may see some boxes around the doors and at the floor level (these mark the location of door/entrances/ and floors in the Tiled editor). They obviously won't be visible in the live version."	t5_2u5zi	True

- Add the s3 upload script. Fix the post template

- Include the correct URL in the self post

- No more demo screen

    For now, the player will just be trapped within the hallway

- You can now kill enemies while flashing

- First pass at the forest level

- Allow the game to scale to larger screens

    Taking inspiratin from mari0, the game can now be scaled. Since all of
the images are pixel art, setting nearest neighbor for scaling keeps
everything looking really sharp.

    In the future, we'll have a menu option for setting the scale. For now,
the scale is set to 2.

- Bump release version to v0.0.3

    In an effort to ease level development, I've moved all level specific
information into the .tmx files. Very soon, anyone with Tiled installed
should be able to author levels

- Add door at the end of the hallway to the forest

- Make tile loader handle rotation correctly

    Now that the tile loader has been fixed, the forest level looks correct
now. It still isn't at the right level, but all the tiles load.

- A step towards framerate independent movement

- Add first sound effects. Fix super speed

    I wasn't properly using the delta time value in player position and
velocity calculation. This commit should make the game perform the same
regardless of platform hardware.

    When you kill a hippy, the hippy not disappears.

    Jumping, getting hit, and killing the hippie now play sound effects.

- Add Timer class to schedule events

    Instead of updating my own timers, I'm using a Timer module. This module
makes it much easier to manage state. Player invincibility, hippy attack
state, and hippy death are much easier to manage.

- Add target to automate tagging of releases

    When debugging, it's very useful to know which version a player is
using. The version is now displayed in the title bar.

**Edit: ~~1~~ ~~2~~ ~~3~~ 4**

Here is the finished Google Docs List.
(The second sheet is the needed graphics list)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Alsb3Kat_oeBdGN1S2ZCSVBZc3ZRLWt0Q3Y0SUxTTXc&amp;output=html

If you have any ideas please comment below and I will update the google Docs with the best/ fan approved secret rooms.

**ORIGINAL POST:**


Right now, I've only planned Troy's 'secret room.'

I'd love to here what ideas you have for other characters.

For Troy, somewhere on the Greendale campus can be a broken AC Unit. All other characters who press 'shift' over it will appear a text bubble that's says something like ""It's really cold in here, I wish someone could fix the AC""

However, if you are playing as Troy, after this text bubble, you will be prompted ""would you like to fix the AC: yes/no""

If Troy selects yes, the screen goes white and he is in the AC school. Here you will see easter eggs such as the room-temperature room, and a room with a 16bit Astronaut making paninis, as well as Black Hitler.

If the future of the game includes items, this would be the best place for a secret item for Troy.

I have no idea how complex it would be to implement these 'secret rooms' for the characters, but I think that it would be a great idea for the future of the game.

- Automatically post new releases to the subreddit

    Thanks to the power of britta-bot, new releases are posted to the
subreddit automatically, with download links, bug report link, and a
change log.

- Move levels over to the Gamestate module

    This module provides a much simpler api for switching between states and
will help make development faster.

- Move source images out of the game.

    Only sprites and logos should be in the images folder.

- Add the Annie sprite sheet

- Add character selection screen

    You can now choose between Annie and Abed when playing the game. I'll be
adding more characters soon, probably starting with Troy

1373127801.0	1hr52e	Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne v0.0.82 has been released	britta-bot	73	9	34	"People of Hawkthorne, We are here today with yet another release!

What's new:

- 11 new costumes
- Updated the Shopping to resemble the one in the show. Also allows the buying and selling of item in bulk.
- Updated Valley of Laziness. New colors, level design and new enemies!
- No longer get stuck when climbing ladders.
- You can now drop projectiles and the drop button has been changed to your INTERACT key.

Known Issues:

- Picking up the white crystal can in some cases cause the game to crash. With the help of [Protuhj's work](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/1h2cod/psa_if_youre_crashing_when_looting_the_white/), we know that this can be fixed in some cases by updating the graphics card driver. If this does or did fix the problem, please comment below as we're lacking feedback on this matter.
- Dropping stacked items is currently funky at best.

Sorry, this is a bit off of the usual schedule but I (DaNiwa) blame the nice summer weather, Canada Day and Independence Day for the delay... Mega credits goes to edisonout for the new shopping and to didory123 for his massive new level.

I know we say this each time, but expect potions in the next release. It's no longer in the ""there's someone working on it"" stage of things, it's nearly here! So get pumped.

1352703708.0	131wzj	[State of the Subreddit] 11,000 subscribers is just the start	Derferman	72	5	8	"First off, big round of applause to everyone for another milestone! We now have
over 11,000 subscribers. According to the
[redditlist](http://www.redditlist.com), that means that we are the #776
largest subreddit. Cool. Cool. Cool cool cool. 

I just want to thank everyone for being part of such a great fanbase. I love
working on this game, and I hope you love playing it. All the contributors have
made this game a reality, and I'm so thankful you've come along for the ride.

So now that we've reached 11,000, what's next?

You may have noticed that the last 1,000 subs took much longer to get than the
previous 1,000. I've looked at the subreddit stats, and we've seen declining
traffic over the past month. Also, the number of releases we're doing has also
dropped off.

This isn't anything to worry about. Reddit is a very fickle place, and one
thing that was popular a week ago is forgotten the next. I'm very confident
that our numbers will start improving once we get releases back to once a week.

The developers have been running into some issues with the code base. Since we
grew so fast, the code base became a bit of a mess. This happens all the time
with code, and it's something we can handle. Right now our focus is on
improving the code base so that we can add features faster. However, this is
only a temporary focus.

Gameplay is, and will always be, our number one priority. Not only do we want
this game to be faithful to the episode, we want it to be fun to play. We want
this to be a game you come back to day-after-day to see what's new to play.

The real work has just begun. Video games are not easy to make. They take time
and effort, so I thank all of you for being patient.

This is a state of the subreddit post, so I'll end with a question. **What can we
do to improve this subreddit?** I'm not talking about gameplay or changes to the
video game, I'm talking specifically about our subreddit /r/hawkthorne. Can't
wait to hear your ideas.

Harmon randomly mentions cactus coins.  He was just talking about how people feel compelled to collect everything in video games and randomly threw out the term 'Cactus Coins'.  He then immediately says there is no reference, but that he made it up and there is no game with Cactus Coins...

As a huge fan of Community, and a gamer the episode Digital Estate Planning was amazing. From the opening to the animation and eventual resolution, this is easily one of my favorite episodes.

When the episode aired we all thought, 'Damn! I REALLY want to play that game."" Here it is, building and progressing rapidly and greatly. The current state of this game and the future of it look fantastic.

I'm not very versed in programming anymore and will do anything I can to help. But, I want to say to everyone who is working on this and has worked on it, THANK YOU! YOU ARE AWESOME!!!"	t5_2u5zi	True

If you didn't know Communicon was this past weekend. I'm uploading some pics from the event for you guys to check out. Major thank you to [Zenmity](http://www.reddit.com/user/zenmity) for bringing extra computers and printing out the amazing banner you see in the album.  
  
Here are some highlights from the event:  
1. Dan Harmon has played the game. Loves it. Loves the details and all the effort poured into making the game a reality.  
2. Charley Koontz (Fat Neil) and Erik Nielson (Garret) both played at game. Erik is sad there is no Garret in the game yet :( LET'S FIX THIS!  
3. Showed Chris McKenna the original end tag placed in the game. He loved it. When Dan originally talked about the end tag, he credited McKenna for coming up with it, but McKenna credits Dan so (shrug).  
4. A lot of people played it and loved it. Some people picked up on the game quickly, others had trouble figuring out controls or what to do, but that was expected.  
5. Signatures on the banners read:  
* ""Britta'd It"" - Gillian Jacobs  
* ""Weight sensors?!"" - Megan Ganz  
* ""These are your loose ends. I'm just tying them up"" - Yvette Nicole Brown  
* ""You just leveled up"" - Dan Harmon  
* ""Pierce stands and hugs Abed"" - Chris McKenna

Today's release includes:

- 25 new costumes
- Poker bug fixes
- Small updates to the Greendale campus including Jerry the Janitor NPC
- Less annoying hippies in the hallway
- Inventory redux: now able to drop items by pressing 'esc'
- Exiting from overworld puts you at the right place on the map

I (Derferman) have recently started a new job, so I haven't had as much time as I would like to dedicate to the game. A huge thanks to all the devs who have taken up the reins in my absence.

We should include that. Here's my idea of how it should work.

The parts can be hidden around the game/purchasable or both

Then we need to make the crafting for it unlockable somehow, it certainly won't be available in the beginning. Maybe we could purchase the recipe or something.

My idea was, a minigame inspired by the karaoke scene with Jeff and Dean on ""Kiss from a Rose"". As we currently have an 8-bit version of the song in the OST, it would be cool to create a minigame around the concept. I think that something like Guitar Hero would be cool, we would press arrow buttons at the right time (when they cross the line on the screen) to do the highest score.

1362653928.0	19u8ei	[Idea] Pillow Fort Level	prene7	63	5	16	"Hey everyone, A few of us were talking about the possibilities of a pillow-fort level as seen in [Pillows and Blankets](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2127579/). Didory123 suggested we get more ideas from the r/hawkthorne community.

Here are some of the ideas that have been *bounced* around:

* A separate level where you can choose which side you'd like to be on and fight against the other side.
* Build your own blanket/pillow fort.
* Enemies could be The Changlourious Basterds
* Weapons would obviously be pillows
* You pull the fire alarm and it transfers you to the pillow/blanket fort level
* Similar to the rave level
* Boss could be [Pillow Man](http://community-sitcom.wikia.com/wiki/Pillow_Man) 
* Capture the dean
* Bonus level where you can gain more hearts by going to Annie's infirmary. 

We would need to convert current Greendale tilesets to Pillowtown and Blanketsburg. Also we would possibly have to create new sprites depending on if we want the Changlourious Basterds and Pillow Man. 

There are so many possibilities. So what are your thoughts/ideas?

It would be added the same as the credits.

There are a few items still on the to do list, but I feel it is complete enough to add it. Please take a look and tell me what you think.

* [Dean's outer office](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/deans-office-1_screenshot.png) - It's not in the image save but I added [an animated secretary shuffling papers](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/secretary.png) and the walls are pea green in the actual level. 
* [Dean's inner office](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/deans-office-2_screenshot.png) - It's not in the image but there is a [dalmatian statue](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/dalmatian.png) (seen in his closet in one episode), which the player turns, causing [a cabinet closet](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/dean_closet.png) to slide and reveal the hidden entrance to the closet ([extra screen shot of items in place](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/closet-revealed.png)). Also pea green is the default wall color in this room as well.
* [Closet level](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/deans-closet_screenshot.png) - I liked the suggestion for the level to advance vertically but it was too problematic, so I had to scrap the idea (maybe I will attempt again later). I added several dean costumes from the show and scattered them throughout the level, see if you can spot them all.

Still to do:

* Add audio selections
* Create sprites for inner office (chairs, credenza, wall things behind deans desk)
* Add closet level bad guys - I am still thinking about this, so I will add in the following game update.
* Add closet level fireplace animation
* Create usable items? - the functionality hasn't been added to the game yet (picking up and using rock, stick, etc.) but if someone has a good idea, I could make the sprites now for any level-related items.

Hope you like it. 

P.S., If anyone wants to try creating any of the sprites on the to do list (just ask), I would love the help. "	t5_2u5zi	True

There are several links at the side of the page that will show you things like FINISHED and NEEDED SPRITES, COMPLETED and WIP CHARACTERS and COSTUMES, a list of 8 BIT SONGS that have already been included, and the STORY DEV WIKI which will show you all the story discussion that has happened so far. 

There have been many ideas flying around and making the front page a bit messy. Here are some tips, upvote so more users see this or downvote if you disagree with these:

1. If you are proposing a NEW CHARACTER of COSTUME, please go to the COSTUME SPREADSHEET to make sure your suggestion has not already been listed.

2. If you are suggesting a NEW SONG that should be included in the game, go to the SPRITE TO-DO SHEET and click on the AUDIO tab at the bottom to see a list of songs that have already been included.

3. If you have a new idea for the STORY LINE, a MINIGAME suggestion, or anything else that could pertain to game flow of any sort, go look through the STORY DEV WIKI. There has been a lot of story development already and your idea may already be there.

If everyone checks these places first, this page will be less redundant and more full of helpful submissions!

Thanks to CalebJohn, DaNiwa &amp; Protuhj, a large number of the blue screen errors you've been getting have been fixed. Nicko21's potions branch has finally been merged so you will be able to brew potions in the next release.

We're still working on the white background issue some of you are having with the valley levels and there probably won't be another release until we get this sorted out because it makes the game unplayable.

If you can't wait for the next release, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey) and follow the instructions for ""Contribute to the game"". You'll be able to download the current code, play the full game &amp; test out potions.

An additional note to people messing around with the code - please follow instructions on github and download &amp; test the code that way rather than editing the releases. We're getting multiple error messages for mistakes you've made which we can't fix because they aren't problems in our code.

After watching the episode this game is based off of and looking though Hilda's code, I feel like Hilda's Command option from her menu can be implemented into the game. I think I read that the command option is not being considered as something that will be put in any time soon but would it be alright if I went ahead and worked on it? I have an idea on how to implement default commands into Hilda which would require a bit of changing to the update function as well as adding the default commands to the menu. Implementing the custom command aspect would be more challenging, but I don't think it'll be impossible.

Greetings Hawkthorne! Now, I know that I am about a week and a half late for this post, but better late than never I guess. I'm going to skip the release summary because I trust that everyone has played and figured out all the new changes. 

This will be a *very* wordy post, as I'm hoping to tackle some real, concrete issues today. All your opinions and thoughts will be greatly welcome!

&amp;nbsp;

--------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##Your Thoughts 

&amp;nbsp;

We're going to be tackling some issues today. These are things that we definitely need input from the players such as yourselves, and all your opinions are greatly appreciated.

* **Ember vs. Flame**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1520)*

Currently, we have two materials in the game that are quite similar, which are the ember and the flame materials. Ember + leaf makes a flame, and flame + stick makes a torch weapon. The question is, does this similarity between the two materials cause some confusion the players? Could a player mistake ember for a flame and assume it does nothing when combined with a stick? Post your opinions below!

* **Player's health**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1473)*

Right now, the player's health is at 20HP. Many of the devs feel that it is way too high, since it is practically impossible for the player to die in any of our current levels. Of course, our levels and enemies are very subject to change, and 20HP might be way too little once we get to the harder, later levels in the future. What we should also be looking into is how we're going to support the changing of the player's max health.

We have all agreed that there will be no leveling system in Hawkthorne, but rather have a variety of equipment that can give the player different abilities and boosts, Zelda-style. For example, if the player gains the ""Boots of Speed"" the player will be able to run at twice the normal speed. If the player gains the ""Armor of Health"", the player's max HP is increased. What I'm proposing is the use of these equipments to allow the player to customize how his abilities will be boosted, though there are other suggestions such as heart containers placed periodically throughout the game giving the player boosts in max health. Post your opinions below on how you think this should be implemented!

* **Costumes/Armor/Equipments**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1516)*

Like I mentioned above, the idea is to create numerous equipments that the player can use to boost his abilities. The question then, is how we're going to be able to fit that with costumes. 

Unfortunately, creating lots of different sprites for armor and equipments that can fit with every costume is an almost impossible task. Here is the proposal: instead of trying to visually implement the equipments on the character, we would go *League of Legends*-style, and have slots that the player can put different items in to customize his skills. 

For those not familiar with League, here's how the system might work:


- Equipment purchases do not have a visual element on the character, only in the HUD. When hovered/selected, they have a tooltip that explains the stat bonuses and any special effects they add. The HUD will expand to have several slots, which the player can customize to put in any item/equipment they desire. 
- Costumes are purely for player enjoyment. They do not add any special advantage or disadvantage. The player can start out and play with any costume, but it will be the items that will actually have an effect on the player's abilities.
- Some items have unique effects that do not stack, while other items can be stacked multiple times. 
- This will leave room for endless customization, one might focus all his items to boost his attack and wield higher damage, or one might choose to focus all his items to boost his platformer skills, and beat the obstacles in levels easier.

Post your opinions below what you think!

* **Controller Support**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1556)*

I'm just going to post the description in the issue since it is much more succinct than I could ever write:

""I think that it's time to re-evaluate the future for controller support in Hawkthorne, the further we get and the more we add it's seeming to be more and more constricting being limited to so few buttons and keys. This pertains mainly to the cheat screen and certain actions such as kicking and punching.

What I suggest is limiting the main game to 9 different keys but allowing use of the keyboard for ""extended"" play features, such as the cheat screen and notes. This would mean regular gameplay is still optimized for use with a controller but if you want to use cheats or notes you have to use the keyboard (which shouldn't be a big deal since as far as i know there is no plan to extend support to other consoles).""

Post your thoughts below!

I wanted to ask for a little clarification about the direction the game is going in. Is this just an attempt to create a playable version of the episode or a fully functional game? Both are really cool ideas, but I'm really hoping the latter is the final goal.

Realistically, this is not that far away from being a playable version of the episode. There are quite a few features and such to implement for it to be everything in the episode, however, the map is just about complete given what was in the episode. (There's the inside of a few buildings in town, the over-world map, and hawthorne castle, but that's it for what was actually shown in the episode. Also, I'm sorry if I forgot something, but realistically, let's say that's about 7 or less maps left to get into the game.)

So I really want to drive at what's next. Obviously, creating all of the playable features in the episode should be next (before getting to everyone's requests for features etc.) While that'll be a challenge, that doesn't leave a whole lot more room for development. That could be done in a few months.

I want to get the creators' views on where things go after version 0.1.0, which (I'm assuming) must be the complete playable version of the episode as it stands. It would, I think be helpful, to know if/what the idea is for continuing the game. When people ask what they can do to help, I think this is what they want to help with. For example, I would love to help with the story content of the ""lost levels"" (unseen in the episode.) However, I don't want things to get confusing if my ideas don't mesh with the creators.

Personally, I would love to work on a story development team if there is a clear idea of where the game is going after the playable version of the episode, or to help work out where to expand the game while keeping it in the spirit of ""Hawkthorne."" There's so much potential in this game to create a fun and fully realized game based off the episode, and I definitely want to see it succeed. So, that's my idea of how I could contribute, thoughts?

We plan on ironing out all the current bugs in the game and focus on making the game as seen in the episode before adding anything new.

So, now it's your turn to tell us what we've missed / what's different. To start will, we'll go as far as the town because a) that's enough in one go and b) beyond that point it amounts to ""pretty much everything"" except the levels themselves.

Note: this is just compiling a list of differences, not necessarily a list of features which will end up in the game. Marrying Hilda &amp; digging wherever you like is never going to happen. Also, in the majority of cases we already have the required sprites, so no one needs to do any art work.

So I figured that since I'm assuming it's much easier to change the color of a tileset than make a new one, I think it'd be a great of idea to make ""darkest timeline"" levels.

Basically, these levels would be darker colored versions of existing levels, with harder platforms/enemies/puzzles, sort of like the ""Dark World"" in Super Meat Boy. These levels could be used as a New Game+,  as hidden secret levels, or as part of the story if you want, whatever you think would work best.

Along with being easier to make than a new tileset, I also think this would be a good way to have more variety in the game difficulty and make some old-school-difficult levels. "	t5_2u5zi	True

1357784360.0	16aegm	Improving the controls	Derferman	48	6	25	"I've been playing [Cave Story](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/) recently, and have been very impressed with the game. It's given me some great ideas, one of which is an updated control scheme. Many people have asked if we could separate out interaction and attack, which I now agree is a good idea. 

Here is my proposal for the controls

    MOVEMENT - Arrow Keys
    JUMP / OK - X
    ATTACK / BACK - C
    INTERACT - V
    PAUSE / INVENTORY - D

I would love to use the UP for interact, but that doesn't work in the floorspaces, which require four-directional movement.

Thoughts?

I guess someone who's better at them can arrange them. I started small on these images and blew them up 400%, because I know it's easier to scale down than scale up if need be.

I can't remember who I was speaking to about coding this stuff, but I'll re-hash the idea.

Basically, my idea would play out similar to the battle against Barba is Legend of Zelda: Adventure of Link. Here's a vid as reference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVRGRTNnDE

Now I haven't made any projectiles for KTS to fire, but that's because I don't know how projectiles work in this code (would rainbow lasers be easier than rainbow bubbles?), but maybe someone who does can make them.

Anywhoo, here we go. Because it's an asymmetrical sprite, I added both sides:

Forgot to add! The idle animations should go back and forth, rather than loop from the beginning. I know that there's some options in some programs that can do that, but I don't know what game creator you guys are using.

1363670803.0	1aksus	Hawkthorne Thread #1	didory123	48	11	56	"Good morning/good afternoon/good evening to all hawkthorners worldwide! This is the first in what is planned to be a series of posts from the developer team that will attempt to reach out to the /r/hawkthorne community at large, and make the game development more of a community effort and experience. 

&amp;nbsp;


--------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;


I'm going to rant for a bit before I really take off here. Feel free to skip this section if you'd like. 

Everyone here, especially the main developers, feel that the game development effort should be community-driven. Every single one of us, the 12,674 Community fans (as of 8:56PM PST) that are subscribed to this subreddit, have come to this place for a single purpose that is the recreation of the Digital Estate Planning episode. Every single one of us has thought to ourselves after finishing that episode, ""this needs to exist as a real game"". Every single one of us has creamed our pants when we found out that it actually indeed did exist, and every single one of us creamed the second pair of fresh pants after we bounced on the head of the first hippie in the hallway. This project is a testament to the amazing and dedicated fanbase of the show, and we'd love it to be fueled by the ideas and work of the wonderful Community fans. So without further ado, I'd like to formally kick off this post that will hopefully help bridge the development experience to you, the fans. 

&amp;nbsp;


------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##Your Thoughts 

So this is how this section is going to go. We are struggling over several gameplay mechanics that we hope that /r/hawkthorne could help us out with. Simply comment on the post your opinion and we'll make sure the general consensus is implemented in the game.

&amp;nbsp;

***1. The Interact Button***

Our current game has two versions of the interact button: 'v' and 'up'. The 'v' button takes care of most things, such as opening chests, or talking to NPCs, but the 'up' button is used for other things such as picking up items or going through doors. These two buttons often confuse newcomers to the game, who often mistakenly attempt to use the 'v' button to pick up items. In this sense, the use of the 'up' button would be more convenient. On the other hand, using the 'up' button will be difficult in our 2.5D levels such as the town tavern or blacksmith, as a player might accidentally trigger events while simply trying to navigate up. 

What we need from /r/hawkthorne is what you think the interact button should be condensed into.

* Interact should be 'v'

* Interact should be 'up'

* [Why not both?](http://www.alanly.ca/memes/why-not-both.jpg)

* Or some other alternative suggestion 

Post your thoughts in the comments below!

&amp;nbsp;


***2. Winter Wonderland***

This is a bit more trivial and not as important, but something we could use feedback from nontheless. Since the last release, you'll have noticed that Winter Wonderland has disappeared from its usual spot beside the Gay Islands. This is due to the fact that we are recreating the game as seen from the episode, as in from Cornelius Hawkthorne's perspective, so any other in-show references would seem out of place in the hawkthorne side of the game. What we need are suggestions in where we can move the Winter Wonderland levels. We'd like to have the Winter levels accessible from Greendale, which if you haven't found yet, is currently hidden in one of the more obscure buildings right now. Should it be accessible from Duncan's office? Perhaps a secret entrance from Abed's dorm? Again, post your suggestions below in the comments. 

&amp;nbsp;

--------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;##Sneak Peeks 

These are small teaser peeks at what is currently in the works. Technically, you can check these out for yourselves first hand over at our [github page](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/pulls), but here are convenient, easy-to-reach links for you to enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;##General Stuff

1. Starting with the last release, we began crossposting to /r/community as well. That would probably explain the increase in posts and subscriptions over the past few days.

1. Where the hell is that so-called master key?

1. Funnily enough, bats in this game are the opposites of Batman.

1. When people keep saying 'hidden forest level', I have no idea if they mean the hidden forest level in the level right before Town, or the hidden tree entrance in Village Forest (courtesy of /u/prene7). 

1. [edisonout's reaction when the master layout sheets were done](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6534956032/h9E7692BE/). By the way, so much thanks to the people who helped out with the rearranging of costume sheets:

&gt;##Suggestion Box

&amp;nbsp;

Looks like I'm out of things to say, hopefully I haven't used them all up until the next post. This last section is something we're trying out. This time, we're asking for ideas and suggestions from people, that **we will actually make sure to put in the game**. The highest upvoted or the suggestion we like the most will be chosen and will hopefully be implemented in the next release. There are two things to keep in mind here. First, keep in mind that these need to be realistic, functional things that can actually be manageable to make. That means no suggestions like ""digging please"" or ""when can I kill the blacksmith"". Second, there is no guarantee that no matter how many upvotes, the highest comment might not make it into the game as we could feel that it's not a feasible suggestion.

We're not only looking for suggestions, but for criticisms, complaints and any thing of the sort. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/1a1g1g/criticisms_complaints_suggestions_etc/) is the kind of input we're looking from the community. We absolutely love being told that we are shitty, please feel free to *constructively* and intelligently provide any criticisms you might have with the game. 

Alright, looks like this is the end of the post. Hopefully you didn't get bored by the end of it, it is rather long, thank you for bearing with me. Anyways, happy October 19th, and we look forward to hearing from all of you!

1358587184.0	16vbgy	Help get new positions into the game - including crawling, punching, sliding &amp; digging (no talent/experience required)	edisonout	40	4	59	"**UPDATED 9th March**

Hi everyone, we're still working on master layout sheets for the characters' spritesheets, adding new actions such as punching &amp; crawling. Every character now has the required sprites in the correct positions.

However, now all the costumes (120+) need to be updated.

It doesn't take long to update a sheet (&lt; 1 hour) - only need to update new sprites, not entire sheet - but due to the sheer number, it'll take me years on my own.


**HOW TO HELP**

[Sign up for one of the costumes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWu3Lwx1gaMdEFoYzFoOEZvWGVoM2wwbS1LNk5KZ0E#gid=0), where you can also find links to the iamges to download. Then update the spritesheet (i.e. colour it in so the costumes match) and upload when you're done. Please leave the black squares in, they're there for a reason.

No skills or experience are required. As long as you can colour in, copy &amp; paste, you'll be fine. No fancy programs needed either - I use paint and paint.net. 

If you can't make the sheet transparent, don't worry - we can fix that afterwards (make sure paint doesn't save it as a black background though, please).

Thanks in advance for your help.

1346034858.0	yvtju	[Feedback Requested] Post-Cornelius Game Plan	edsterman	43	5	17	"As many level ideas have been flying around lately, I thought I would share my thoughts on the how the game might be structured after playing through the Digital Estate Planning levels and defeating Cornelius. 

While the priority of many people working here is to finish the levels of Cornelius' game, I think some thought about this post-Cornelius game will help keep many of the other ideas organized (even if they are not actively worked on).

So, my recommendation is that after defeating Cornelius there is some transition that involves the concept of the game becoming Abed's modified version and the scene in which you play baseball with Cornelius. At the end of that transition, the player is granted access to the hallway exit door (maybe given a key - maybe ""Abed's master key"" from the animated webisodes?). However, going through the door leads not to Greendale (as it does currently) but a room with multiple doors (each representing an independent sub-game with its own storyline). One door would lead to Greendale as it does now while others would lead to each sub-game's own starting location. 


- [Here is a quick graphic illustrating the concept](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/hawk.png), the sub-games shown (designated with letters) are only examples - I am not arguing for these examples specifically but I wanted to show some possibilities and show that they could obviously be different sizes.

So, when new ideas for levels are raised, I think the first question should be does this idea make sense as:

* 1. a part of the DEP Cornelius game?  
* 2. a part of an existing sub-game (right now that is only Greendale)?
* 3. a potential new sub-game or part of a new sub-game? 

For example, the idea of an Community AD&amp;D adventure has repeatedly come up. It doesn't seem to fit in #1. It could maybe fit in #2 (meet Neil on campus perhaps and play an AD&amp;D levels as a mission). It could also fit in #3 because just re-creating the story line in the Community episode would involve multiple locations and enemies, so it certainly has the potential to be bigger than a level or two. It obviously could also be #2 and #3, with a small Neil AD&amp;D level within Greendale but also be the basis for a larger expanded version at the same time. The point of this example is to show both some of the considerations for where ideas might fit but also demonstrate that knowing where an idea might go would also help determine what details need to be worked out to bring it closer to reality.

My focus has been on the Greendale sub-game, so I obviously also have some specific ideas about the locations and levels that might be located within it, the details of which I will post separately.

If we add a secondary hub area (like the study hall) that is Troy and Abeds apartment, we could have three areas, the ""Dreamatorium"", ""Abed's Computer"" and the ""Table with a Die"".
At the Dreamatorium you select a character from the Greendale 7 and then Abed uses the Dreamatorium to visit some unresolved area in the persons mind, sort of like Assassins Creed. Here you access extra levels, like those that have been mentioned here in /r/Hawkthorne. Stuff like the zombie level could be accessed through each of the seven but possibly with slightly different story lines, Troys being the longest.
At Abeds Computer (and I know this plan is already mentioned/ in action) you get to play minigames etc. You can find more information about Abeds Computer elsewhere.
At the Table with a Die you get access to the randomly generated level idea many have suggested. Though this may never be implemented I thought that having this be at the Table with a Die rather than the Dreamatorium would be an excellent idea.
One last note, some of these memories/ minigames should have to be unlocked by playing the main game first (like the trampoline level being found by going in the hedges). I also think this should be the same for costumes. Like Annie Sexy Santa being unlocked by Annie crouching on top of one of the chimneys in the village. But that's just my two cents.

(http://i.imgur.com/6r2gBr4.png)

I've been forcing my way through more multiplayer stuff even though I had intended to ease up on developing it. Some fun things I noticed during the process so far that everyone who has been listening to me on IRC would get annoyed hearing.

The Java client uses libgdx, which has a very strong and active development community, so I see no reason not to be able to support a Java client in the future when multiplayer is complete.

What does this mean? We'd be available on more machines with less effort and we'd have a viable basis for going mobile. To anyone claiming Java is slow. It's not. It's technically faster than Lua even when Jit'ted, plus a lot of internal stuff in libgdx is native C++.

Some benefits I see already:

* easily resizable windows. Our Lua implementation is similar to a prom dress made out of carpet remnants. This is the unfortunate reality of Lua being an easy language to modify.
* easily maintainable code: any front end(Java, Lua or otherwise) is minimal code. The backends do the heavy lifting like physics and stuff. Any extra stuff that a client wants to do is optional.
* refactoring isn't a nightmare: I see no universe where people appropriately name all variables and functions the first time. Changing their names shouldn't waste development time. In Lua it does.

Had some issues with merging my Lua Server to version 0.0.69. I've had to maintain separate branches that have differing functionality in the past, but multiplayer touches so much of our code in so many places I don't know if it's feasible to continually update my code with the master branches.


EDIT: Oh yeah, status updates. I think the Lua Client+Server were well on their way to viability. Most sprites were displaying correctly. Only backend issues were dynamically spawned items and gamestate switches."	t5_2u5zi	True

**COSTUMES**

All characters now have additional holding and crawling sprites (for the air vents levels) but still need their costumes updating.
[Check out this spreadsheet for what's still to do.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWu3Lwx1gaMdEFoYzFoOEZvWGVoM2wwbS1LNk5KZ0E#gid=0)

**MISSING &amp; UNIDENTIFIED SPRITES**

I'm currently working my way through each characters sprite sheets and have noticed some positions are missing, while there are others I can't identify.
[Use this spreadsheet to help me out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWu3Lwx1gaMdG1ORzBWSHRtUzdIZlB6bUcwR25renc), either by listing the action or creating the relevant images.

**UPDATING THE INVENTORY**

When people make objects that represent materials (such as sticks, rocks, and leaves), if you want to pick them up and use them, we need you to also make a 15x15 image for the inventory.
This is why you can't pick up objects in Gay Island - no one's made the images.
Example: [Rock image combo](https://raw.github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/master/src/images/materials/rock.png)

**PROGRAMMING**

If you're interested in helping code the game, [head over to Github](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues?state=open) and take a look at the current issues and bugs.

**PLAY TESTING**

[Read this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/14p3ih/request_playtesters/), download the game, play the game and report bugs.

**IDEAS**

If anyone has any ideas to improve current game or wants extras to be added to existing levels, post a comment, let us know and we'll see what we can do.

**REQUIRE HELP?**

If anyone would like some assistance, I can add your problems to this list and get someone to help you out.

**ANYTHING ELSE**

If none of the above strike your fancy, no worries. You're free to do your own thing, whether that's comment and vote on posts, [add new characters](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Character-creation-guide), [new costumes](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Costume-creation-guide),
[create a tileset](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Tileset-creation-guide), create some 16-bit music, post other ideas or spread the word.

I want to try and lend my hand with ideas and story so I want to run some things by you guys before I go updating the Wiki. And so I submit ""The Darkest Timeline"" levels.

If you have played ""Super Meat Boy"" you might be able to tell where I am going with this, if not I will fill you in. In ""Super Meat Boy"" you can unlock the dark world which are the same levels but upgraded to be harder. After you beat Hawkthorne you could unlock the darkest timeline levels that Chang them make them harder and give better items. You could also tie this into the story where you play through the game trying to get into the real timeline by beating it (kind of like a whole separate game, but you would need a maxed out character to do well). What do you think?

Do note that it would break the shows cannon as Pierce would be dead by this point and unable to get the invitation to play unless we take some creative liberties (which I don't think you guys would mind)."	t5_2u5zi	True

First reddit post. Joined because of this fantastic project. Hope to participate with story development etc. I want to throw out a suggestion. If this is already suggested, I apologize.

Think it would be awesome with a faux command screen within the game, just like the one Gilbert accesses halfway into the episode (see this screenshot: http://imgur.com/uWyyj ). By pressing e.g. Enter during gameplay, this command screen could appear. This cheat code entry field can be used to activate or unlock various features.

In the episode Gilbert activates the following (assuming I’ve transcribed correctly); Weapons Override, Nullify Oponents, God Mode, Enhanced Potency, Ripple Time, Demux Parameters, Unlimited Strength, Unlimited Running, Testicular Fortitude, Giraffe mode, Enhanced Knowledge, Potion Skills, Speechcraft, Max Inventory, Intestinal Fortitude, Resperitory Powers, Invulnerability, Infinite Regeneration, No fall damage, Nuclear Health, 

We could build further on this, to unlock various codes, e.g. «Chang to level 3», etc.

The idea is that they'll just be standing around in the room, and you can talk to them like you'd talk to say, the hat club guy in Greendale. Just deliver a line or two.

Let's talk stats. About two months ago, we started tracking game opens. On
average about 700 people open the game a day, with 1500 being our biggest day
yet. I'm hoping to get this number over 2000 in the next few months.

As many of you may know, Annie is one of my fave characters, and one of my biggest issues with Season 4 is her not really having a real storyline or development...It feels almost as if the new showrunners have hit a big red button the reads ""REGRESS"". However, I'm not going to turn this into a rant board, I just decided to vent creatively with some more costumes!

Some of the costumes that were mostly white made her skin look washed-out, so like the Skeleton costume I made earlier, changed Annie's skin to a more peachy colour.

This is how I imagined them to work. The tube of wipes is spawning the actual wipes. To get the wipes to stop spawning, you have to destroy the tube. The tube can't hurt you, but the wipes can.

1365902952.0	1cavwk	Puppet Abed (and Important Study Group Meeting)	CreedogV	31	1	10	"http://i.imgur.com/T6Y2SfS.gif

Firstly, I wanted to get feedback on making puppet costumes. In this case, I've modified the structure of the character while still keeping them in place. The head is thinner, and the nose is reshaped, and eyebrows are unconnected. 

And he's got no legs. (EDIT: This may change.)

**IMPORTANT POINT:** I am making the larger, Muppet-style Abed, not one of the Dean's hand-puppets the real-life actors used in the initial scenes, and I'd encourage others to do the same. Their costumes are different and they're meant to represent the actual characters in flashback. 

Secondly, I wanted to start a dialogue on how the puppets will behave, because it'd be nice to have a consensus. 

1) Walking. The puppets have no legs. I felt it best to replicate the look of the puppets and not give them feet. This will affect a lot. Since they can't walk, I would recommend they dodder around like Muppets: 

http://i.imgur.com/tUSjeGP.gif

This can be accomplished with the same three-frame action as regular walking. 

(EDIT: Because of early replies, I'm considering making the mouth move slightly during walking for more action.)

2) Kicking and sliding. Same challenge. For kicking, I would take a cue from metaridleyX's Jeff-in-a-Box sprite (http://i.imgur.com/OcSn2aN.gif) and simply have the puppets ""kick"" with the bottom of their torsos. (More like a hip-check.) Unlike that one, in reality, the base will remain on the ground, with a bulge near the bottom where the imaginary puppeteer has just jutted his elbow out. 

(EDIT: If legs are added, I may also try to indicate that kicking is actually the limp legs being jerked forward.)

3) Arm bars: Muppet-style puppets use little bars to move their arms. I have included them in my design. They don't hurt anything, though they'll appear to be emerging straight from the ground, which really replicates the on-screen look. They won't even interfere with weapons since the weapons are plastered on top of the character sprites. 

I'm actually planning on splaying the arms a little during static sprites since it's the default for puppets. 

4) Jumping: One of my sprites shows a sliver of puppeteer arm. Ignore it. The puppet, since it'll have to jump on things, will simply be a legless creature, bouncing on its base. 

(EDIT: Regardless if the puppet is legged or legless, the puppeteer is 100% out.)

5) Crouching: I'd like to incorporate some wrinkling/crumpling of the fabric when the characters crouch, as if the puppeteer just pulled his hand down, making the torso slide up the forearm. 

6) Hurt: There's precious little opportunity to demonstrate the physicality of the puppet's mouths (maybe during jumps, too?), since our sprites don't have a talking option. Here is where we can see the Kermit the Frog-style panic mode, the mouth wide open and the top half of the head bent back at a 90-degree angle. 

7) Dead: My current idea is to have a ""deflated"" puppet, which the sturdy head still intact, but the body flattened by the lack of an internal arm. This is also another opportunity to have a wide open mouth.

I remember first playing Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne around September, and how much needed to be done. Then yesterday I played it for the first time since, and to see it now is incredible. Props to all of you guys!!

That being said, I do have a couple minor suggestions/comments going forward. Sorry if any of this stuff has been brought up before, I just started looking at this sub yesterday for the first time in months.

**Respawning**

* I've mentioned this in another thread but I think it would be great if when you respawn, all your inventory and money would be reset to what it was when you last saved. 

**Inventory**

* I noticed that if you have a full materials inventory and try to combine items to create a new material (i.e. rock + rock = stone) it doesn't place the new material in your inventory, it just disappears.

* Would it be possible to remove items from your inventory without selling them? For instance, I made a bunch of boulders but can't sell them and aren't used for anything at this point, so they just take up space. 

* Eliminate the item count cap in the weapons inventory - or at least alter it. It's very frustrating having to switch every 15 throwing knives (especially when facing the Boss Jive Turkey). If all your weapons could be pooled under one item slot, that would be great. If not, maybe you could automatically switch to the item last used if you have more of them in your inventory?

* Similarly, maybe implementing an item count setup for materials, like there is for weapons. I'm not sure how this would effect combining items, but it would be nice to have one slot with all your sticks or stones in it, instead of having multiple instances of the same material.

**Healing**

* I noticed that when I tried using the healing potion I bought from the blacksmith, it just takes me back to my last save point, with full health - which is effectively the same thing as dying. Not sure if this is intentional or not, but thought I would mention it. 

**Map**

* When I opened up from a saved game, the map won't let me go to places I've previously visited. For example, I was in the Black Caverns, and wanted to return to blacksmith in the town. However in order for me to make it to the town, I had to go back to the beginning and work my way through the forest (which isn't a huge deal, it's just a bit cumbersome).

Anyway those were just the things I noticed when playing the game the last two days. This is incredible, keep up the great work. You guys are all awesome!"	t5_2u5zi	True

Inspector Spacetime tileset
http://i.imgur.com/5z95dYT.png


I tried to create something as similar as possible to the IS scenes in the show. I added some elements that could be interesing for a hostile environments, such as spikes, acid drops, geysers, crashing meteorites. There are rock platforms, and cavities which can be put in rock surfaces to climb on. Credits for the telephone cabin and lava go to BuckyBrewer and Ohsin.

I noticed that blorgons' sprites are already done, so it could be a good opportunity to use them (btw, I made my version just in case you'd like to include variety in enemies). Eyes and stars could be used as collectible objects in this level.

To access this level, there would be a telephone cabin hidden in a random level, which would teleport us to the secret IS level. If you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me. Also, if you'd like to add anything to the tileset, do not hesitate !



I listened to the Valley of Laziness 2 music in the OST, and I was thinking... maybe I'll start working on it. That would be nice to have an underground level (in the tacos on the overworld map).

~~`ATTACK` selects an option~~

`JUMP` selects an option

`ATTACK` goes to a previous window in a UI

In other words, in the shopping gamestate if you select the weapons category and press `JUMP` you return to the window that allows you to choose a different category

### Dialogs (and Cutscenes)
~~`ATTACK` advances a single dialog~~

`JUMP` advances a single dialog

should skipping a set of dialogs be an option? if so either `INTERACT` or double tap `JUMP` might be appropriate.

*Sidebar: @jhoff's suggestion of double tap to move down a platform has already been proven very intuitive especially in light of the most recent playthrough video.

### Doors
`UP` (or down or left or right depending on the direction of the door)
**and**
`INTERACT`

Either the directional key that corresponds to the direction of that door or `INTERACT` should be viable solutions

### Picking up materials that end up in your inventory(leaf,stick, rock, et al.)
`INTERACT`

### Picking up an object that can't end up in your inventory(pots baseball)
`INTERACT`
If you have a weapon equipped we can tell the user they can't interact with objects that can be picked up until the put away their weapon... or we dequip it for them (opinions?)

### Throwing an object that you're holding
`ATTACK`

### Dropping an object that you're holding
`ATTACK` + `DOWN`

### Vertically throwing an object that you're holding
`ATTACK` + `UP`

EDIT: please try not to let your current use of the game affect your objectivity

EDIT2: reedited for `JUMP`==`OK`

So I have in mind three Mariachi band members that would roam around at different 'zones' but when near player they would follow him playing and hitting him until player drops money.Now I don't know if being able to drop money would be a feature so this can be changed.

I would make sprites as time allows ... shouldn't be too hard.

Mariachi no.1 Guitar player : Plays and hits with guitar (like a club) alternately.

Mariachi no.2 Violin player : Plays and hits with bow.

Mariachi no.3 Trombone player : Plays and Pokes with Trombone slide.

I also think dancing skeletons from 'Day of the Dead' is a good choice.

Pros: being helpful, testing fun stuff, playing the latest code before releases! new enemies! new levels! and the occasional new costume!  
Cons: nothing

* [Players can become detached from floors](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/700)
* [leaving the trampoline level kills you.. sometimes](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/646)

* [Levels don't regenerate](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/592)
* [Screen quickly switches sizes](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/609)
* Characters teleport to the beginning of the level when the open the pause menu.
* Characters get stuck in specific locations in the study room

Old Bugs:

* can't jump on trampoline with a weapon


We'd need people to test all the old bugs and new bugs on branches to see what parts of new code are improving.

This is a portion of all the actual bugs, but it has the general idea.

EDIT: these bugs will probably also include a priority number later on.

0) game doesn't start  
1) blue screen  
2) gameplay can only continue by going to the start menu  
3) gameplay can continue, but there is a noticeable error

1) follow the  instructions on Kyle's page for setting up the game:

Yes, to all you people pouring the next shot in the ""Fawks has another bizarre idea"" drinking game, remember that I lost where the idea dump sheet is. Also, as a yay/nay since I'm gonna have to make the sprites. Obbbbbbbbviously not gonna happen soon, since we still need to finish up the main game, and we've only seen one boss so far! Also, if you're doing said drinking game, save me some blue curacao. I wanna make myself a Sonic Screwdriver.

Okay, here we go...

Dean's Closet needs a boss. Who else will guard the drafts of Time Desk from being stolen? Professor Garrity? Don't make me laugh.

Some sort of giant, robot...Dalmationator. Not gonna be a hard boss, though. Think more like an upgraded version of the scrapped Qilin enemy or like Dr. Robotnik in the drill-car from Sonic 2: dodge them as they charge, then jump on them before they turn around. Also, let's get some lasers in there, too.

Anywhoo, if there's a way to code changes in dialogue depending on who the player is using, it's the cherry on the sundae. For most characters it'll be the standard ""Intruder detected! Neutralize threat!"" or other generic robotic guard-dog speak. If the player is using Jeff, however, the Dalmationator states that it must ""Return Jeffrey to master: conscious or not!"" before it attacks. Playing as the Dean will confuse the Dalmationator, and it states that you being his master is improbable, declares that you must be the Doppledeaner, and attacks.

Just throwing that out there. I guess thinking up enemies and bosses is one of my stronger suits. Much of my non-Hawkthorne game ideas have no level design, just what baddies will be there. =P

Aside from the boss and its adds, I also had an idea for Chupacabra enemies in the level that would function just like Chain Chomps from the Mario series. Like the Chomps, three smacks on their signpost will free them and they'll run off - leaving rewards.

* [Hawkthorne's offical contribution guide](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Open issues on Github](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues?page=1&amp;sort=created&amp;state=open)

**COSTUMES**

* If you're creating / udpating a costume or character please [update this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWu3Lwx1gaMdHZieml1OFBwalFwLU5tc2xZb0Njc2c#gid=0) so we don't get duplications and we can keep track of them all

**SCANNING ANIMATION**

* We're currently working on adding the scanning animation from the opening credits into the game, [here's our WIP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJCGDNVpLX0)
* [Finish Jeff being scanned in](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/900)
* [Finish Troy being scanned in](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/902)

* [Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/1a6hhj/enemies_which_kinds_you_can_and_should_make/)

**SANTA'S GROTTO SPRITES**

* Help create toys / shelving / furniture / anything else you would like as background decoration in the level
* Sprites should fit a 24x24 grid, bearing in mind characters are on a 48x48 grid

**PLAY TESTING &amp; FINDING BUGS**

* If all you want to do is play the game, great! If you spot a bug or problem, please mention it either in the release post or on github rather than create a new post. Repeat, do not make a new post. Thanks, it's much easier keep track of them this way, we don't get duplicates &amp; they don't clog up the subreddit.

**IDEAS**

* Hilda's dialogue is currently just a placeholder - if you'd like to suggest things for her to say, [head over here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCFeTzmg4yCXU5BqnaRFwVlOeEl6CtUoCEG2Vbume90/edit?usp=sharing)
* Unlockable costumes/characters - [add suggestions for how they can be unlocked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11WKYkSHu8x0PrlOecSAjvEKqd2KkTs2GAagz_dge4ns/edit?usp=sharing)
* Loads of you have been suggesting new ideas which is great - please do a quick search before you post to check whether it's been suggested before
* While the devs are focusing on getting the game up to v0.1 (i.e. a complete game with more content from the episode) we're developing a new way of getting some of your ideas into the game sooner. Be sure to watch our for a post from **didory123** soon on this topic.
* Please note, we'd prefer direct show references only for Greendale &amp; additional levels (ie. Winter Wonderland &amp; Cave of Frozen Memories), the main game should stand on it's own.

Now, this game is one of our biggest if not our biggest community contribution to, well, community, and large parts of the greendale portion are influenced by episodes other than the digital estate planning episode that the game was inspired by. As new episodes come out, we may want to include content from them in the game.

So take into account how they would act differently when designing the different movement sprites.

I see references to the costumes in the to-do list, but can't unhide the rows for some reason.

I already added a one-liner to the wiki under [Minigames] (http://hawkthornestorydev.wikispaces.com/Minigames), but perhaps this could be an interstitial level or mini-game with the gang facing off against the Poppy Longstockings - or any of the other teams (see below) - as a pre-requisite to Black Cave (because you know, black people LOVE to dance).

* [Heather Pop and Locklears (Gang - Pierce + Chang)] (http://i.imgur.com/AT1Jv.jpg)

* [Unknown (""Think Global Pop &amp; Lock""? - anyone make out the name?!?) (extras)] (http://i.imgur.com/BxFpD.jpg)

Ideally, this would be a co-op level with basic dance moves completed by one or two characters (""And now, the puppet""). Again, **think DDR** - up, down, up, down, left left, right right, etc, with a split-screen view and the Dean in the middle determining who wins (dressed in Oktoberfest costume, natch).

1374796649.0	1j2auu	A few humble suggestions...	DearAntarctica	30	4	2	"First off, I'm fucking overjoyed this game exists. It's amazing that something like this has come together from a decentralized fan community to make so many people happy. 

That aside, I also wrote out a nitpicky list of minor concerns I have about the game — in no particular order:

-Fairly certain this is something everyone is aware of, but the current difficulty curve is a little wonky. Most (regular) levels are pretty easy except for the underground sandpit part of the Valley of Laziness, where platform/jump challenges suddenly get MUCH harder. I think the Gay Island/Black Caverns levels should be tougher, they feel a bit boring after the Sandpits. And maybe a bit more difficulty leading up to there would be good to get players ready, something roughly Cave of Frozen Memories-level.

-The writing in NPC conversation trees and answers stands out as VERY rough. Most if not all need a punch-up and copy edit. The Hilda information list should be in a consistent voice and peppered with acknowledgement of the games being referenced — maybe a spreadsheet or dedicated thread for this would be useful. 

-Some NPC conversation dialogs don't have an ""I am done with you"" option, which seems odd/inconsistent.

-Selectiong *Yes* in the save game dialog produces a sound that sounds like a menu exit or cancel, rather than a save action being performed. If the player has a full health bar, there's zero acknowledgement that the game is being saved. I think a different sound effect would be clearer here, along with maybe some visual acknowledgement that the game has been saved (but it shouldn't be too time-consuming). 

-On the same topic, a new, non-cancel-ish sound effect would be good for selecting ""yes"" on actions that open secret passages. Maybe something ""affirmative"" sounding that's the same as the save-game ""yes,"" maybe something unique (Zelda inspired maybe?)

-Would like to echo the call for projectiles to be grouped in larger quantities (i.e. not overflowing to a new tile if you have more than 15 throwing knives). 

-IMHO ""That's What Christmas is For"" doesn't fit the mood of the entire Cave of Frozen Memories, would maybe suggest saving it for the lower/inner chamber or some later event here. I know figuring out that whole level is still quite a WIP and not top priority though.

-I LOVE the costume unlocking idea and eagerly await its implementation.

-Would possibly like to see something rarer in the hard-to-reach chests (esp. the treetop chest) (nothing is really ""rare"" now, per se, but y'know.)

-I love the idea of differing item prices (bones more expensive in the first town), but why are bone clubs the same price there? Shouldn't they be more expensive too?

-I agree with the comment that the Ember and Flame look too similar, and would support a change from Ember to Spark or Flint.

-I kind of feel the default mapping of jump to spacebar makes for awkward finger positioning, maybe this could be rethought

Would love to hear comments, discussion or criticism on any of these. "	t5_2u5zi	True

1339614751.0	v0aa5	[UPDATE] From the Story Dev Team	NotablyConventional	31	4	12	"Hello, r/Hawkthorne, the story dev team has been cloistered up at the [wiki](http://hawkthornestorydev.wikispaces.com/Welcome), and we've got some progress to share.

We've had a virtual pitchfest and we've landed on a few things we'd like to share. The very first thing we've done is lay-down our priorities based on Derferman's guidance from the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uj01a/clarification/) which started the story development wiki.

Priorities:
#1: Reinterpret the episode as seen on TV. Six playable characters (Jeff, Britta, Annie, Pierce, Shirley and Troy) going through only the levels seen on TV and communicating the story through text and cutscene as well as playable bits. This game is all on the railroad tracks. The player's not really going to have much impact on actual gameplay.

#2. Expand the game to include the levels on gay island, valley of laziness, etc. Include more fully realized versions of leveling, etc. Still very railroad tracks.

#3. Work out Abed's role as a playable character (since he stays at the village and learns the ins and outs of the game, it's simpler to remove him from play at that point) which includes crafting and the more customizable elements of the game seen in the episode. 

#4. [Abed's computer](http://hawkthornestorydev.wikispaces.com/Abed%27s+Computer) and beyond. These include characters not seen in the episode and creating more Community the game than Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne.

Abed's computer is the story justification we found to recreate more of the community universe than Cornelius would have created. At the end of the episode, we see Abed ""rescue"" Hilda. From there, the basic idea is that he's taken the entire game and loaded it on to his personal computer. He then changes elements of the game to reflect his experiences at Greendale. It's a combination of mini-games (like the ever popular Epidemology Mini-game) as well as giving story justification for including characters like the Dean and Chang. It's unlocked by beating the game. We have some vague notions about how to get the idea that the second and all subsequent playthroughs are now being played not on the Hawthorne system, but on Abed's computer, but we're still looking for suggestions. (Also, this is a LONG, LONG, LONG, LONG ways away.)

(Really long, like, if it's not clear from that last sentence, it's really far away.)

We'd also like to offer a friendly reminder that if you have ideas about how the game will communicate the story to the players, please use the wiki to discuss these ideas. There's been a fair bit of redundancy (i.e. people posting ideas that have been discussed here prior to the wiki and are being discussed at the wiki now.)

[Let's (potato chips)](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uxzfk/idea_do_you_think_we_could_get_dan_harmon_to_help/) [try](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uxuwh/this_might_solve_the_tutorialproblem/) [to](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uzuw6/idea_playing_with_gilbert/) [limit](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/v01ap/idea_inventory_system_vault_system_atm/) [that](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uzbn7/idea_gay_island_challengequestminigamewhatever/) [redundancy](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uzqja/idea_chang_backstory/)[.](http://www10.pic-upload.de/07.03.12/vwuwgcdt3cr4.gif)

1338633315.0	uh1ba	[Idea] Characters abilities and customs	lurebat	30	5	12	"Hey, i don't know how much this post is vaild, since it dosen't contribiutes any resources to the project, just ideas for the characters, but i think it could make a nice mechanic in later stages of development, so hopefully it will fit in to post it here.  

So my first idea is characters abilities, becauase we have 7 characters to play with, and right now the only diffrence is in the looks, i thought it would be nice for each character to have his own little ability to start the game with and diffrinciate himself:

**Troy** - no active abilities, but boosts to ""stats"" - like in the show he can jump higher (1.5 times more), and to balance also walk faster and hit harder.  

  

**Pierce** - have the ability to sprint(or run away - when pressing the sprint key Pierce will go to sprint mode in which he can run 3 times as  fast as he normally can, and he takes half the damage, but he can not hit enemies nor jump in this mode, each sprint will last few seconds and have a cooldown afterwards, also you can't stop mid-sprint, so people won't use it for one second to get half the damage when hit.

**Jeff** - simply have the ability to slide, it could get him to narrow spaces and dodge high attacks.

**Shirley** - can do a ground pound - when jumping she can do a ground pound that will sent her to the ground quickly, doing a aoe damage and knockback to enemies around her.

**Annie** - can do a ""using her sexuallity"" attack, meaning she will sent an heart looking projectile that will stun the closest enemy for a short time, she can only use it once per enemy and it has a cooldown.

**Britta** - can do ""the worst"" attack, called like it because it does a small amount of damage(5%?) to enemies, but it affects all of the enemies on screen at a time, ofcourse have a cooldown and enemies can only be hit by this once.

**Abed** - staying with the racist theme of the game, abed can do a terrorist attack, he creates an explosion around him that somewhat hurts him but does great damage to enemies in the area.
(okay, this one is pretty bad, and maybe some of the others too, if you have good suggestions leave them in the comments).



That's it for the characters abilities, the second machinic i want to purpose is having to do with the alternative customs that are already implimented in the game and how each character could use them.
My idea is to have ""Custom tokens"" scattered around the game that will give each character an ability from a custom, the tokens will be hard to reach and often use a character ability to get to them (like having a token somwhere high that only troy could reach, or having one half stuck in the ground so you will have to do the ground pound on it, etc).
This is how each character will use them:

**Abed** - will randomly get alien custom or batman custom
Alien custom - for few seconds abed wil run fast, jump high, and could insta kill enemies, even far ones, by leaping on them and attacking them, ends after few seconds or 2 kills.
Batman custom - can glide for a few seconds while jumping, and do a smaller version of the ground pound, ends after few seconds or 2 ground pounds.

**Pierce** - can turn into drugs, and can use it to stun every enemy in the room for few seconds, but lose the custom afterwards.

**Jeff** - can turn into ""hulk jeff"", slightly bigger, faster, and a lot more stronger, ends after few seconds.

**Annie** - turns into karate annie (from paragdims), can punch in the face and instakill to enemies, then she fills with remorse and loses the custome.

**Britta** - turns into brittasaurs, that can shoot three fireballs into enemies, that will hit them but still continue until the end of the screen, after those 3 she have to pee so she loses the custome.

**Shirley** - turns into ""Big chadder"", makes her angry, twice the size, but extremly slow, each step she does does a ground pound to the area, lasts for few seconds.

**Troy** - turns into that robot nerd thing from the halloween episode, can shoot strong projectiles and hit harder, gets destoryed after few seconds or one hit from an enemy.

And that's it, these are my two ideas for the game, i know it's early in development to add those, but hopefully it will be implented in the end, ofcourse feel free leaving comments to help make these ideas better or just yell ""THEY SUCK YOU LOSER"".

1367163061.0	1d9x5r	VOTE: How to visually implement armor	edisonout	30	5	27	"Apologies for my rambling post yesterday, I'll try to keep this one short.

Some of the devs have recently had a discussion on how to visually implement armor in the game, we all have strong opinions and we're divided over what to do.

We thought we'd open it up to you guys to get your opinions on the matter. We have 6 options and they each have various upsides and downsides.

[Here is an image of the six possible options](http://i.imgur.com/INuKH3M.png) - on the left is the character without armor &amp; on the right with armor.

1. Visually, nothing changes. How can you tell if you have armor on?
2. Costume doesn't change, but armor appears in your hud, much like weapons do. This may cause issues if you also have weapons equipped.
3. Switch from your costume to the character's armor spritesheet - will look strange if you go from playing as Thoraxis to normal Jeff in armor. Will also need to creature spritesheets for every character other than Annie.
4. Overlay armor onto the current costume - this won't match up exactly and will look very strange on certain costumes, such as Troy &amp; Abed sewn together or Britta Teapot [With 180+ costumes, we're not adjusting the armor to fit the costume]
5. Character changes colour when they have amour - similar to how they turn red when they're attacked - this isn't how they did it in the episode, colours don't really shout ""armor""
6. If you want armor, you have to use the base sprite, this is how it appeared in the episode - people will miss the costumes

So, what do you think? "	t5_2u5zi	True

1354458961.0	145gbb	[WIP] New Abedtown Tavern	NimbusBP1729	29	7	21	"I wanted to start some preliminary work on the New Abedtown Tavern. 
Here's [**my current non-progress**](http://i.imgur.com/hFXEq.png)

My thoughts: the first floor should be a bar filled with familiar NPCs from the town. Obviously, there should be a bartender which I haven't included yet

On the second floor should be the Casino where we have the two card games we currently have as well as additional machines that will house a variety of minigames as you unlock them during normal gameplay.

The third floor can have anything from a restaurant to a house of illrepute. It would be a nice reference to the era the game appears to be set in as well as simpsons.

On floors 4 to (n-1) will be hotel rooms(IDEA: beds can be used to replenish health at the expense of time) and the final floor will have a pool. Obviously you can't swim yet, but if you can that could be a fun addition.

I sincerely hope someone more competent than me can help take on this work.

EDIT#0:As a reference, remember the player is 48 pixels tall  
EDIT: needed sprites

* a fancier bar than we have in the tavern
* a slot machine(this can be used to play any of the environment switch minigames)
* more NPCs (we already have some that we simply haven't put in game).
* restaurant stands
* A sprite to show the curtains opening(this is an enhancement)
* a super fancy gold pool with a diving board
* New Abedtown chairs

1367070741.0	1d7r9s	Story Dev Discussion Thread #1	edisonout	33	10	8	"After his most recent post yesterday, didory123 and I have decided to resurrect hawkthorne's story development team (henceforth shortened to ""story dev""), although this time round the focus will be slightly different. 

**STORY DEV'S FOCUS**
------

Instead of simply pitching ideas, enemies and plot lines we will be constructing a road map for each level, where obstacles, enemies, bosses, sub-levels, quests etc. are all thought out and all have a purpose. I'll expand on this further .

**EXAMPLE**

The town level is a perfect (yet simple) example of what we require. The main level is a simple left-to-right progression but with 4 interesting aspects which are almost essential to gameplay (although currently incomplete).

1. **Hilda** &amp; other NPC's - provide you with information (e.g. tells you where to find the white crystal) to help you complete the game
2. **Tavern** - more specifically, the poker game  which allows you to increase the number of coins you have, so you are able to buy things elsewhere
3. **Potions lab** - can brew potions which will give you specific abilities to use elsewhere
4. **Blacksmiths** - buy weapons so you can defeat enemies more easily.

So for each level we'll need to consider the following (this list is not exhaustive):

* What do we want from the level? Does it have sublevels? A boss? Quests?
* What's the goal? What's the story? How is this connected to the world of Hawkthorne?
* Are there materials to collect? What will these materials be used for?
* Are there areas where we need special items or powers? Will we need a potion? How will the player know they need these?
* Will we need to craft something? Will we have passed all the required materials to make this yet?
* What sort of enemies do we want? Do we want  a variety? Will they be defeated in different ways? 
* Will I be forced to use weapons to kill this enemy? Which weapon? (I'm lazy, if you don't make me, I'll jump on it or over it rather than craft a weapon - give me something with spikes all over it and I might be hesitant to do that).
* Is there anything new the player encounters in this level? Will they know how to approach it? (e.g. is it obvious they're supposed to climb up the vine or fetch a key from somewhere else to open the door)
* Will players have to backtrack to complete the level?
* Will certain areas be locked?
* Will certain items be available which can/must be used later on?
* Are there hidden items or areas? Are there areas which are only accessible once players have completed something elsewhere? Will player have to interact with something (like straightening the picture frame) to find the door? Will they have to dig down to it? Will doing anything in this level unlock/affect something elsewhere?
* Will players want a save point? Are they likely to have enough health at the end of the level to take on the boss?
* Do we want the music to change in certain areas? What sound effects do we need?
* What obstacles are going to be in place? Jumps? Spikes? 
* Is the difficulty going to be based on timing? Skill? Practice? Having the right materials? Large number of enemies? Powerful enemies? Big jumps? 
* What can players interact with? What's the purpose of this interaction?
* What makes this level enjoyable? Where's the fun?

Now I'm not suggesting we go into deep analysis and start contemplating every pixel or think everything must mean something or each jump serves a higher purpose but people will get frustrated if we include a watermelon they can't pick up or a door they can only open with a key they don't have or have to use a potion purely arbitrarily. 


**STORY DEV'S GOAL**
------

The story dev will act like a brainstorming group who will pitch, discuss, veto, develop and improve ideas to flesh out levels,  with the ultimate goal of producing a road map of each level. So a document listing the features, enemies, sub-levels, items etc. we want to appear along with their purpose which we can then pass over to the level designers. 

We will begin with Valley of Laziness and Gay Island because they are the levels we saw nothing of in the episode so we have no guide to how the level should play out.

**GETTING INVOLVED &amp; COMMUNICATION**
------

Anyone who wants to can get involved can do. For starters, discussion will happen on [**storydev chat**](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hawkthornewriting) - note this is a different channel to the usual hawkthorne IRC. We can begin by discussing what we want to achieve in more detail and didory123 is very keen on getting people involved in creating the levels using tiled so we can walk you through that.

Depending on the number of people who get involved and their time-zones, we can arrange meetings, either on IRC or possibly google hangouts or another virtual meeting option. Alternatively, each member could each have their own google doc with ideas, maps &amp; images which the devs can consolidate to one document or reddit post and get the rest of the community's opinions. I'm reluctant to use the storydev wiki because it's out of date, requires an additional sign up and it's very easy for good ideas to get lost. If anyone's got a better idea, please let me know. Possibly an additional subreddit?

[**Sign up here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWu3Lwx1gaMdFRPWjdfTWhud21CVG45ejFPVG4wSFE#gid=0) - fill out the spreadsheet with your username, timezone &amp; a link to your google document which will eventually be full of ideas (can just be a blank word document for the moment - make it ""anyone with the link can view"").

**FINAL WORD**
------

If you'd like to have a say in how this game is expanded, join in the story dev discussion  and your opinions can help influence the future development of this game.

Everyone's ideas and opinions are welcome but please don't get annoyed, rude or mean when not everyone agrees with you or your ideas don't make it into the game. Some ideas will be rejected, maybe because they're useless, don't fit in with the game, are impracticable or impossible. 

Ultimately, the devs (and especially the magic dev trio of derferman, jhoff &amp; NimbusBP1729) have the final say but this is a community project and we'd love to have you on board.

**TL;DR** We're coming up with ideas on how to expand Valley of Laziness &amp; Gay Island - you can help out if you'd like."	t5_2u5zi	True
1365772757.0	1c7cn2	Idea for costume select screen	edisonout	26	2	10	"[Here's my suggestion for the costume selection screen](http://imgur.com/Ac9vV2r)

So here's how my idea goes: once you've selected your character on the current selection screen (&amp; maybe have separate button for can't be bother to pick costume, go with the base &amp; start the game already), you get this screen, which resembled a yearbook/scrapbook. Tabs along the side allow you to navigate to other characters (I haven't been bothered to all put these in).

The currently selected character appears in the large square up the top, possibly looping running animation.  You've then got coloured squares containing all the costumes for that character - chosen one highlighted. I've currently got two different colour schemes - the one on the right page is brighter, but the one on the left copies the colour scheme from the previous menu so I think will be a better fit. 

Then, because the characters don't all have the same number of costumes, to avoid blank space, we can include ""photos"" of the gang throughout the years - Halloween, astronauts, Christmas, paintball etc. which can be different shapes/sizes to fill to gap.

Other ideas for decoration (which I haven't included), maybe just include two or three of these per character:

* custom backgrounds for each character (e.g. stripes, spots, flowers)
* comments/messgaes - like on the DVD cases
* doodles - flowers, mustaches, hats, devil horns, again like on the DVD cases 
* pictures from the credits e.g. Joel McHale's nose monster peeping over the edge of a photo
* Greendale butt logo

I don't think it really goes with the look of the game but I'm hoping a change of colour scheme and/or more detail &amp; tweeking can fix this. I thought we'd want more than scrolling or just having squares to select and yearbooks sort of go with the community college setting &amp; the DVD covers.

EDIT1: Maybe the insufficient friends only get a single page rather than a double one.

EDIT2: Maybe you don't get this from the main menu, but from the pause menu instead)"	t5_2u5zi	True

[Link for the source and other related things.](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/762)

The audio in the second video is out of sync.

So... I've been moving along on 3 connected pieces of Hawkthorne software.

1) A client made in Lua  
2) A server made in Lua  
3) A server made in Java

The client and server in Lua are (for the most part) the same original hawkthorne code.

Since I really like Java I wanted to do some work on reimplementing the entire server in Java. [This video shows execution of the Java server combined with 2 lua clients](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9x63Lja1Q). Don't worry, I know the gravity is ridiculously weak that's easily changeable.

The client still has a bunch of work that needs to be done (mainly rendering all nodes). I only implemented the rendering of items(namely the leaf) as a proof of concept.

Developers:
If you're familiar with the code, nodes have a 'name' and a  'type' and a few other typical parameters in common. Looking at lua was frustrating me because we use nodes differently in different places because the language allows so much freedom.

This was the main reason I wanted to rewrite code in Java. The structure of the OO makes it simpler in many ways. Don't get me started on how much easier refactoring is when you have a language that can use a reasonably good IDE.

So. this post is a request for a couple of things:

1) Any developers who would be interested in helping write code for any portion of these things.

2) Standardising all of the nodes in the Lua code... because it makes sense.


EDIT: This was implemented partially as a proof of concept. If someone wants to develop this in C++ instead I could definitely get on board with that too. Lua and C are already bedfellows anyways.

EDIT2: As an annoying quirk the Lua Server uses Love2d so it sort of unnecessarily launches a new window. The Java server is written only using libgdx for tiledmap parsing. Whoever wants to tackled it could easily do a  polygon/rectangle collision detection. Polygon/polygon might be a little extra work. A Java client(or any other client we want to build) could/should use libgdx for rendering all objects. That'd make it easily playable on droid and other devices.

EDIT3: The Java Server intentionally drops you from that random location. I did that to make sure the doors were working as intended.

* slightly higher jumping?

* zombification + decreased speeed
* temporary invisibility
* temporary invincibility
* flight
* increase in size (I like how this will make you have a larger bounding box, so it might hurt and help you)

I know that people there's already people working on making the campus explorable but i was also thinking that there should be a way to explore other locations that the group has gone too. For example The Ballroom (Mixology Certification) : http://i.imgur.com/sB0W2.jpg , Annie's old apartment, Troy, Abed &amp; Annie's apartment, etc. These places could be joined by large outside maps like the greendale exterior that show other locations from outside that we never got to see the inside such as The Red Door/L Street, Dildopolous, Pierce's Cult.
   And this would be a great way to unlock outfits by having hidden objects that you find (ex: find 4 shirley drunk pictures and unlock one of her outfits) since theres too many outfits (plus the ones coming in Season 4) to unlock from within the Hawkthorne game or minigames.

Everyone's been making great stuff, and now it's time we took it to the next level.  EvilTimmy and I talked with Derferman and we're working to give the music more structure and organization. We will be working together to figure out what goes where musically for the game. If you want to join us in our cause, **send me a message with your email to join our google group/drive**. More details below.  
  
**Why the group?**  
While there's a lot of great submissions, we need to start getting an idea of what goes where and how will ""submission #1"" fit into ""game section A"". We need more loopable music for levels, possibly original music for unseen levels, and figure out how to give the flow of the music more structure in the game. The audio to do spreadsheet can only accomplish so much. Granted, we only have so much of the game available to us to work off as of now, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't get a head start.  
    
**There are other plans for the group as well:**  
Do you have completed songs? Upload it to our google drive to get it mastered for the game. Want tips and help with creating 8 bit? Talk with other music makers in the Hawkthorne Google Group. Can't figure out a certain section of a song? Ask someone to help. Let's be a helpful community, and the soundtrack sounding the best we can.

I only have Troy, Pierce, and Abed done (not too skilled at Photoshop but I've gotten faster since I first started on Troy). You can see them [here ](http://imgur.com/a/3SCUc). Credit goes out to [fhiz](http://www.reddit.com/user/fhiz) for supplying the high-quality character sprites [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/tu5tr/high_resolution_sprites/) and [Fishsticktheatre.com](http://fishsticktheatre.com/TV/Community/community.html) for the live-action reference photos.

I just got my hands on the character sheets so I'm going to make them and submit them soon.

For the mini-game, as I suggested on the feature request list, it could just be a one level game with zombie Greendale students (no idea how to make them as of yet so I welcome any thoughts on this matter) endlessly spawning like the zombie section in the Call of Duty series. The level could be a palette swapped version of the ""hippy room"" from the current release. 

And it would be so awesome if the background music would be MIDI versions of ABBA songs featured in the episode like [""Waterloo""](http://www.linxure.net/~justice/abba/waterloo01.mid) and [""Mamma Mia""](http://abba.cz/midis/Michael.Boyce/Mamma.Mia.mid).

I think it would be beneficial to have the names levels appear at the start of each level like so: http://i.imgur.com/zU8vzbf.png , and it could fade after a second. (That would be especially helpful in levels like the cave of frozen memories).  Which leads me to my idea. 
I think it would be cool if we could have a 1/20 (or whatever) chance that a level is in the ""darkest timeline"". What I envision that meaning is that everything appears dark, and enemies are harder to kill and/or damage you more upon impact.

**Level: Forest Labyrinth**

* comprised of three sub-levels which have doors connecting different parts of them (I kind of think of them as different layers of the overall level with doors allowing you to naviagate the layers)
* these doors allow the player to maneuver around obstacles and progress towards the true exit
* challenging platforming is present throughout, and enemies are plentiful
* the doors are unmarked; thus the player must take note of which parts of the level are connected
* hidden area in which I'd like to have a small stash of coins as a reward for risky exploration (I don't think this is possible at the moment, though)

I'd be interested to hear what you think.

Oh, also, here are some pictures of the [first](http://i.imgur.com/5u1bXjY.png) and [second](http://i.imgur.com/unLyqZX.png) layers of the level that I've got working already.  I haven't really done much on the third one, but I do have an outline of what I'd like to do with it.

EDIT: I think I may have been a little ambiguous in my phrasing here.  I have a playable version including the first two layers [here](https://github.com/MesonicInterference/hawkthorne-journey/tree/forest-labyrinth), and it's actually quite fun.  Note: to get to the level, enter Forest 1 and go to the new door in the tree at the beginning.  Recall that only the first two levels are working, so don't be surprised when it crashes - it's unwinnable without that third level.  It's still pretty fun to play around in, though."	t5_2u5zi	True

As many of you may have noticed, the costume tester has undergone several enhancements over the past week or so:

* Zoom Inspector
* Original Character overlay with adjustable opacity control
* Animation control for basic movements
* Play all button
* Import of all existing in-game character data

Most recently, I've added the following:

* True animation ( up to 60 FPS with true-to-game speed adjustments for each animation sequence )
* Lots of bug fixes
* Fully tested and functional in Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    * ( Note: Untested in any IE, and known issues in Opera )
* Updates to keyboard controls for smoother transitions
* Speed control slider
* Added Uservoice for accepting new Ideas and Feedback

Added 07/26/12

* Abed now supports the Attack, Jump Attack and Running Attack motions ( using the 'a' key )

I do appreciate any and all feedback on this. My goal is for this tool to make testing sprite sheets better for you. If it's not working in your browser, or you're experiencing otherwise odd behavior, please let me know.

I was in the Registrar building in the door on the far left (where the Human Being is) and I was just messing around.  I stood on top of some lockers and tried to pull the fire alarm.

The prompt came up to pull the alarm but when I went to select it, instead my weapon (mace) got pulled out and the prompt just stayed on screen.  I could run in front of it and everything.  I tried replicating it and it worked once but not another time so I'm not exactly sure of the difference.  Couldn't close the prompt with selecting either.

anyways.... this is Part 2, Valley of Laziness.. [Part 1 was the forest i suggest you look at that first to kinda see where im going with this](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/12i8hp/wip_overworld_map_forest_levels_loooong_read/)


anyways...


[You might want to open this](http://i.imgur.com/fPD1H.png) and look at it as you read along with this. When the player enters the Valley of laziness they will see this screen, but colored and details.. now for the stages and their details and story somewhat..


**Stage 1 - 'La Siesta' Desert**
- the current level the game has now, just needs to be a lot longer. At the end of the level there is a sleeping man on top of a building, the player can try all they want but they can not wake him up. After the long desert they will continue to the next area.. 


**Stage 2 - Los Tacos Passage**
- this way to exit the Valley of Laziness, but your pathway is block by some huge taco meat [its kinda like a cave-in but with taco meat] near the meat they meet an old man name Senior Old Timer (Senio el anciano?!?) he tells them that the only way for the meat to be removed is for it to be eaten out. After the player tries and takes damage, he states only the 7 true pure breeds [originally had only the true mexican, but mexican girlfriend said it may come off bad] can stomach that kinda spice. He states that the 7 true lazy men/women are in different areas waiting sleeping to be called upon. the player states they saw a sleeping man who was unwakeable in the desert. He gives you a bell (that makes a siren noise) and states that should wake them up, he tells you when you have one following you to come back here so they can start eating so it can go faster.


**Stage 1 - 'La Siesta' Desert**
- with the special bell, the player must play this level again to get to the sleeping man, use the bell to wake him and take him back to taco blockade.


**Stage 2 - Los Tacos Passage**
- after bringing the man here, he immediately goes to the taco meat to start eating. Senior Old Timer states the next area he saw one was in his hometown the Village of Laziness, but cant remember where.
-Note after every area the player comes back here to drop of the pure breed, but im not gonna write it over and over again here since this will run long as it is.


**Stage 3 - The Village of Laziness**
- this is the worst looking area in the entire game. It's completely done in black &amp; white and all the buildings are just either squares or rectangles with the name of whatever it is on top of it. boxes with the word labelled cactus are the scenery. theres an overpriced INN where a player can rest and heal, Rigged games for you to lose at, thiefs that can take your money. but if the player talks to right people they'll learn the lazy pure breed woman is napping behind the cactus. which they you can bring her back. there also signs leading to different areas (like the parking sign at the greendale section in the game) once dropping the lady off the player can choose which section they want to go to next from here, Nacho Cheese River Boat Ride (40$); Trampoline Tortilla Skies Jumps (20$) and Aztec Pyramids Tour Guides (20$) some if not all will be need to be play twice to get everything you need. but the player gets to choose the next area(s) they want.


**Stage 4 - Nacho Cheese River**
- Players go on a tortilla chip boat and must defend it from taking too much damage from banditos and enemies. At the end the player must jump off the boat onto a platform/hill above a cave which leads to a waterfall. the player will walk up a small hill and see an another tortilla chip boat with the lazy man on it, climb aboard and wake him up the player will fall down the waterfall on the boat and land near where the other waterfall would of landed. the player and lazy man will wake up ashore the los tacos passage where the lazy man will eat. If the player doesnt jump off the tortilla chip boat onto to the hill but falls down the first waterfall the player will see the other tortilla chip above them in the cave before they fall. the player will still wash up ashore the tacos passage without the man.. and be force to pay and play the level again.


**Stage 5 - Tortilla Skies**
- After jumping on a giant trampoline the player lands on a giant flying tortilla, the player must jump from one tortilla to the other avoiding flying enemies and falling, as there is no ground and falling off the tortilla or a mis-time jump will lead to death, the player keeps moveing when a very quickly and very fast tortilla with the lazy man flies below them the player must jump timely on it before it flies away. If the player doesnt die and makes it on there the lazy man and player fly all the way back to the tacos passage. Senior Old Timer tells you once you either chosen this path or aztec pyramids that there are other areas past the tortilla skies, like the pinatas fields and past the pyrmaids lies the mountains.. he warns them theyll have to go there again to get to the other area and just keep going till you finish the area.
** - if the player already had the lazy man here, or the player chose not get them yet, the level will finish soon enough.


**Stage 6 - Pinatas Fields**
- player reaches this place after finishing the Tortilla Skies. A very colorfull and bright landscape as hundreds of pinatas are laying around. Things turn creepy as one pinata runs from you. another burst through and begs for you to kill them, as it is severly busted up. Regardless of what you choose, the other pinatas will see a (near) dead pinata at your feet. they will begin to attack you. Now pinatas will come out and attack you at random throughout the level. Once you get to the end you see a small fortress/base camp, the remaining pinatas ask for mercy, the player argues you came after them first while they were just looking for someone, they beg for mercy thinking you were from the village here to take their young, They explained the people of the village take there young and old and destroy the leaving their dead corpses and injured bodies there. These Pinatas Fields are more of a Pinatas Graveyard! After hearing there sappy story, the player sees the sleepy man in prison. The player can [threatened] say he will take that prisoner now! whether by force if need be! or the player can [trade] by asking what they would want for him. If the player threatends they will flee and the player can take the prisoner and jump into a pinata cannon that will take them to the tacos passage. If player tries to trade, they will ask for 300 gold so they can beef up their defenses here. if the player says yes to the 300$ they will happily give them the prisoner and use of the cannon,  or the player says no and threatends the pinatas like he would of originally.


**Stage 7 - Aztec Pyramids**
- Inside the old pyramids the player must have a torch and the spirit candle in both hands to see and to keep the day of the dead spirits from killing them. The Candle can be bought in town or outside the pyramid. the pyramid seller sells it for more though. With both hands occupied the player can not attack (attacks are useless anyway against these enemies) against the ancient mosters/cat people/ghosts in here. The player must hide and dodge when enemies draw near. When the player makes it to the end theres a hidden room right near it, the hidden room has the sleeping man near some ancient machinery. Using the bell wakes up the man and it also turns on the machine, both players jump in and it teleports them out of the pyramid and to the taco passage. Level needs to be replayed to make it out the pyramid the regular way to and unlock the next area.


**Stage 8 - Sombreo Mountain**
- once outside of the pyramid, the player notices a crying child on a donkey, when the player asks id she is lost and where are her parents? the child points to the top of the mountain. The child refuses to get off the donkey and donkey refuses to let the player touch it. The player must open paths through puzzles which will require the player to stop traps, pull levers, defeat enemies to open paths for the donkey. Once on top, the player will see the sleeping man, the child runs to her parents, and donkey tries to rest. The player uses the bell to wake the man but it scares the donkey as well and he kicks you both off the mountain all the way to the tacos passage.


**Stage 2 - Los Tacos Passage**
- After bringing all 7 of the pure breeds to here, they can eat all of the taco meat blocking your way. That when its discovered that a Giant Bean is pooping out the taco meat. this bean is the last thing that stands in your way to the gay islands.

**BOSS BATTLE** - El Beany, the mean bean fiend
- not sure how this battle will be yet. but at the end the 7 pure breeds will eat him, maybe the battle is he is pushing you off the screen and your pushing it towards the pure breeds idk..
- once the battle is done you may leave, as Senior Old Timer wishes you luck and promises to look after the now serverly overweight pure breeds.


*2nd Playthrough*
-- all 2nd playthroughs are after the white crystal is freed, but the levels have been upgraded in difficulty whether more enemies, different enemies or enemies take more damage to kill and more damage from you.


**Stage 2B - Los Tacos Passage**
- when you get back here, the 7 pure breeds are not feeling so well and they are still very bloated and block your path. Senior Old Timer begs you to go to his friends house just outside the forest at the town. he has a hidden room behind a secret entrance involving a painting. In that room there is a book which will help him come up with a cure for these men and women here. Once you go back and retrieve the book and come back here, he will tell you to go his house (the locked house in the village here) he gives you the key to get certain ingredients needed for his medicine.


**Stage 3B - Village of Laziness**
- Once youre given the ingredient list and key to senior old timers house, the player will notice that the pinatas have overtaken the village. If the player gave the money to the pinatas earlier they will repay him with over 3x the amount 1000$ and everything is free in town for helping them start the revolution. If the player did not give the money, the pinatas will attack him and the player may not rest or buy things from here again [SIDE NOTE.. Villagers are now at the pinatas fields in the small fortress]. After unlocking the house and getting two of the ingredients, a little cockroach will take the last remaining ingredient and run under a book shelf. The player will move the book shelf to discover a secret entrance to a similar potion room like in the town. The cockroach runs into a sewer hatch in the room, the player follows.

**Stage 3C - Village of Laziness - Salsa Sewers**
- the players jumps down into salsa sewers which has skeletons all over the place, the player will eventually get to the end of level and take the ingredient back as the cockroach runs away.. the salsa sewer water slowly starts rising.. then all of a sudden it bursts through the wall behind you GUACAMOLE!! RUN!! the player must now run and jump over skeletons and get back to entrance before youre consumed. once youre safely back the player now has all the ingredients to help the pure breeds.

**Stage 2B - Los Tacos Passage**
- once youre back old timer will take the ingredients and start chanting nonsense, he will then give them all medicine. The pure breeds begin to turn green and vomit and vomit and vomit tons.. while Senior Old Timer continues to chant, then shouts ""El Beany remains, you shall live again with me!!"" and jumps into the vomit pool.. a giant dripping vomit monster will rise.

**BOSS BATTLE** - El Vomito!?!
- not sure how this battle will be either since im still not sure about the bean fight yet either.. once defeated, the player tells the pure breeds not to eat him! they respond ""dont worry, we have something for cases like this"" they whistle and a bunch of dogs and come and eat up el vomito remains. The player is able to go to the Gay Islands again.

**INSULT THE CHARACTERS**

In the episode, when Gilbert reaches the throne &amp; Cornelius appears, identifying Gilbert and saying ""You are the bastard offspring of a colored seductress and an unknown, weak-willed miscegenist.""

Obviously, this insult won't make any sense if you're playing as any of the other characters. I'm open to suggestions as to what he could say to offend the other characters. I'd prefer original ideas to quotes from the show (i.e. don't suggest ""you're the worst"" for Britta).

**IMPROVE THE ENDING**

Also, after the big boss battle when Gilbert finally wins the inheritance he just walks up to the throne, sits down &amp; a couple of fireworks explode in the background. 

To me, this seems a of a lame ending and I think there should be something after it that's a bit more impressive.

So first things first, we gotta finish the North Cafeteria, you can grab consumables, Baggles, etc there. I can draw all that. I'm still learning Tiled and Prene is helping me. Not the point of this, though.

Through some sort of Easter Egg or secret way, you find yourself in another part of the 'caf. It's decorated like the Sophie B. Hawkins dance in Herstory of Dance. You go to the stage. Who's there?

SOPHIE B. HAWKINS. Boom.

First, let me tangent a bit. Anyone here play Animal Crossing? The new one is coming out in a few days so I've been playing the old one on the DS to get re-acquainted. Some nights, in the game, you go to the Cafe and there's this dog with a guitar, K.K. Slider, who will ask you if you have any requests, and he'll play you a song.

Well, in Hawkthorne, Sophie will be taking Slider's place, and if you choose ""I have a request"" from the dialogue tree she will play you any of the songs from the game, and maybe a few of the 8bit songs that aren't there yet (Like Roxanne. You can finally let Britta enjoy that song in peace) Am I the only one who enjoys going to those menus and whatnot and playing the music? I hope not.

So I went ahead and made a pull request for saving locations, but I think a giant red telephone booth is an eyesore, so I thought I'd open up the community to see if there was a better option.

My suggestions:  
1) something much smaller maybe the size of a leaf. Ideas?  
2) This one uses some of the Doctor Who knowledge. In Doctor Who the blue public police call box that the TARDIS manifests as is just a side effect of the TARDIS's cloaking mechanism being broken. Originally  a TARDIS could just look like whatever was appropriate for the time period it was in.

So... we could have different colored phone booths. Just not blue. Any more drastic cloaking would probably be confusing for the player.

It's a hornet (and yes, it has a front stinger), and is on a 48x48 grid. The first four sprites are a regular flying animation, the next four are an attack/charge animation, then the next three are a death animation. I don't have a hurt sprite, as I'm thinking these will be a one-hit enemy. The last four are for a hive. I think it makes sense to have them come out of a hive like the Wipes enemies (which are way to cute to kill, BTW). The first is the base sprite, the next is a hurt sprite, and I think hurt + the next two makes a good death.

Anyways, I'll take any feedback/suggestions for improving these. Since so many people are working on costumes, I think I'm going to keep making enemies. Next up is a mustached cactus for the Valley Of Laziness!

1362710206.0	19vygk	Pine Tree Station Level	Fanaticalistic	24	4	7	"I know that a Santa's Grotto level to appear after the Cave of Frozen Memories is in the making right now, but I thought it'd be nice to put Pine Tree Station right in between those two levels. Just like in Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas, the player could activate the cave's self destruct system, opening a hole in the ground that would lead to a train station (or just directly to the train itself).

Trains are great for 2D platformers because of how long they are. On the train would be a fair amount of small Christmas themed enemies (example: ornaments, similar to the acorns in the forest levels). Even though I was hearing that there might be a boss fight in Santa's Grotto, I thought having the Christmas Wizard, or Christmas WARLOCK at this point, teleport throughout the level and attack/summon more enemies would fit.

In this scene in the episode Duncan tries to force Abed to snap out of his delusion, so whenever the Christmas Warlock comes near the player in the game it could look like reality is seeping in, much like it does whenever Duncan enters Abed's delusion. By this I mean it would look like the world around the player looks more like the study room whenever the Christmas Warlock approaches. From the scene: ""There's no more journey. It's just you against reality, and reality always wins!""

Of course, even if Duncan is to appear as a boss in the grotto, he doesn't necessarily have to be a defeatable boss when he's on the train. He could just cause more mischief when he's around.

The goal of this level would be to get to the roof of the train, and from the roof get to the front car where the controls are. The player would turn the speed of the train to bjork, the screen would glow white and the level would end. It would make a nice, smooth transition from the cave to the grotto."	t5_2u5zi	True

I figured I would just submit mine for a little bit more peice of mind :).  I just recently found 3 areas..2 secret and 1 more noticeable than they others.  The Noticeable one was a door that leads to the whole campus.  And I also found 2 secret things that I won't say to keep it a secret.  (One has to do with a object from the episode: Aerodynamics of Gender and the other is more of a random Peirce's dad thing.  But after finding out there are more things than meets the eye with this map I just thought of a whole bunch of stuff but only one I thought was worth sharing.  I found the dorm in which Abed stays and also where he created the blanket fort with Troy in the episode: Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design (I'm a community hyper nerd) and so I thought what if you made on the upper closed off level or maybe make a secret door then you have a big blanket fort with a whole bunch of rooms explained from the episode such as Peirces Mom Memorial Room.  Now I titled this Blanketsburg and Pillowtown because (even though its from another episode and takes up the whole school rather than just the dorm) they added some rooms in that episode too that I thought as a community fan and the fan of this game would be SOO much fun to explore and goof around with.

When the paintball actually started in that episode, you see Jeff walk around the school wondering what has happened, until he talks to garret. Then Leonard comes up from behind trying to shoot Jeff, so here's where i got the idea. I thought of a game similar to many iPhone games. The idea is somewhat similar to ""Monster dash"" on the Google chrome web store, in the idea that you are constantly running and dodging objects and such.

I thought that Leonard could be chasing you, and shooting paint balls in your direction (from behind), while you are jumping over desks and tables to prevent hitting them and slowing down. Once you reach the end of the level, you could slide under while paintball Abed jumps over you and shoots Leonard. Hopefully i didn't explain it where it sounds to complicated.

I do understand that there would be some issues with optimisation, and also some players may prefer the tighter field of vision. I haven't worked with Love before, so I've got no clue as to how to address the former, but if the latter proves to be an issue, maybe a wider field of vision could be toggled on and off in the options menu.

1345790400.0	yqqhy	[IDEA] Markovian scripting and response system for dialog	Rainfly_X	23	2	14	"The following is probably too ambitious, but it's my attempt to make possible the flexibility and open-endedness of the model Hawkthorne game, in a way that is both technologically simple and open to people extending it forever and ever, as well as providing huge amounts of replay value thanks to the randomness factor.

**First, a note on [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)**

These are kind of a specialty of mine, and it's possible to make some crazy stuff with them. They are most commonly used for text analysis that learns as it encounters more input (like spam filters), but in this case the probability graph would be static/curated, in the same sense as any game resource.

A Markov chain is a system where every given state has a set of possible ""result states"" weighted by probability. The classic example is a frog that jumps from lilypad to lilypad, and for each lilypad, there is a likelihood for each other landing spot, like 25%. More advanced systems can take not just the current pad into account, but the _chain_ of the last _n_ pads the frog has jumped to.

**How does that apply here?**

It's a metaphor for my system, but not an exact fit. Each character has a ""buffer"" of 10 recent events, a FIFO queue numbered 0-9. This is analogous to the ""chain"", which determines the likelihood of other actions and pieces of dialogue. Some chains of behavior will be 100% likely to happen (""strongly written""), others will allow for random branches into other possibilities (""loosely written"").

**How does it work?**

Each character stores a 10-item queue. The character also has a set of preprogrammed ""responses"", each of which has one or more filter conditions. A filter condition is basically a regex of the buffer, for example:

    /\dPIERCE: Go suck a bag of dicks./

A response with this regex will *only* be used as a response to that Pierce line, because it's so specific. A response also has a ""content"" property (thing to execute and add to the buffer) and a ""likelihood"" property (relative weight for random probability).

A response content consists of the format ""NAME: Words."" It can also be used to trigger a Lua-scripted action using a forward-slash, though with a limited syntax: ""ANNIE: /throw sword at GILBERT"", which will call Annie.throw(""sword"", ""at"", ""GILBERT""). For more control, you can use the double-forwardslash, in which you can use pure Lua. The same command would be ""ANNIE: //Annie.throw('sword','at','GILBERT');"", which is a little verbose in this case but does the job.

There is also a special character named ""CONTEXT"", which can be used to track the topic of discussions. Responses can then use regexes that are aware of this syntax to factor the topic into the probability. Because each buffer belongs to a character, separating groups of characters means they can drift into different topics, and it may take awhile for the contexts to sync back up when they rejoin - just like in real life!

The final feature is that for search purposes, the number of a buffer line's position is prepended to the line. For example,

    9JEFF: We've been walking for hours.
    8CONTEXT: Jeff bitching.
    7TROY: It's a videogame. It doesn't hurt to walk.
    6JEFF: It hurts my thumbs. Is no one else feeling this?
    5PIERCE: Jeffrey, you text all day every day. No one even knows who you're texting. You should be ideal for this. Like Gay Island.
    4JEFF: Oh shut up, Pierce.
    3SHIRLEY: Pierce, why do you have to keep bothering Jeffrey about his sexuality?
    2JEFF: ....
    1SHIRLEY: Sorry, Jeff. Not to imply anything...
    0JEFF: I'm disowning you all as friends.

This means you can filter for a sequence of events very easily, through multiple filter conditions that take line position into account. An example that might get triggered in this case:

     /2JEFF: ...$/
     /0JEFF: I'm disowning you all as friends.$/
     likelihood: 3
     ANNIE: Don't go, Jeff. Most of us like you!

**Parallel actions**

Multiple triggers for CONTEXT can occur simultaneously. Same for actions, both forwardslash and double-forwardslash. Only one character can talk at a time otherwise. This is great for keeping dialogue sane, but retaining the ability to script killer fight scenes.

In fact, fight scenes bring up an important use of this scripting system: you can push events like player damage, death, and weapon equips into the buffer so that all characters can respond to them.

**Limitations**

The format for dialogue writing is clunky. I think the biggest fix would be to allow a sort of shorthand for multiple lines that lead from one to the other:

     /2JEFF: ...$/
     /0JEFF: I'm disowning you all as friends.$/
     likelihood: 3
     ANNIE: Don't go, Jeff. Most of us like you!
     TROY: That's right. We stick up for each other to the end.
     2&gt;TROY: /meaningful_look with ABED

Response content lines with a x&gt; are given likelihood x, otherwise it's inherited from the group likelihood. This is especially useful for having conversations that are unlikely to start, but need to be fairly predictable once they get going, so you'd override likelihood for just the first line. Each line in a group is created with a regex to match the previous line at position 0.

Another limitation is executing so many regexes so often. Compilation helps, but we also need some sort of way to prefilter entire modules of dialogue based on location and conversation... top-level filter conditions, perhaps? That's the best solution I can think of at the moment, and not terrible, though I welcome other ideas.

Finally, it has to integrate with the dialogue style of the existing game, including Hilda and the Blackjack Guy. This is something I really didn't even factor into my thought process until the last minute, and I still don't know exactly how to do it.

**Implementing this**

I'll try to do it off in my own wacky branch stuff on my own time, but if this idea interests others, I'd even be happy to collaborate in an advisory role to someone with more time on their hands. It will probably take a long time before it's useful, and I don't want to hold back development on the core game in that time.

I think it's something that's fully technically possible, will be easy to expand for the rest of time by users with little technical knowledge (given example dialog), and is our truest possible path to recreating something as wacky and non-deterministic as the Greendale 7.

**EDIT FOR FEATURES**

After sleeping on it, I figured out the solution to integration with the existing dialog system. Whenever you're supposed to talk, you get a list of all randomly available options that your character would have, sorted by likelihood. Then you can choose whatever you want - which also means playing as different characters will allow you to discover a lot of hidden/unlikely conversation paths. If you're a completionist, you'll love this, though the inability to play as certain game NPCs will still limit your ability to methodically analyze every possible game path.

The one problem with this is that often, there will be multiple possible responses to an event, and only a few are things that your character can do. I can see a couple possible solutions to that. One is to only consult the player if the random choice lands on any of the player's options (if there is only one option for that player, do it automatically). Another is a ""meh"" button mapped to the keyboard, which lets someone else do the talking - or acting - instead. Lots of ways this could go, and I don't know which will work best without trying it out in-game.

Also, some parts of dialog should be able to be filtered on game state. Also, you may want to only say a line if some regex FAILS. For this, I'm introducing the following types of filter for both modules and lines.

    /matching_regex/
    !/failing_regex/
    :Lua expression

In this example, the line is only allowed to ""happen"" if the buffer contains ""matching_regex"", doesn't contain ""failing_regex"", and the Lua expression evaluates to True. Filter conditions should not have side effects, which is a new concern introduced by the :expression syntax. It's also something that can't really be tested in a Heroku app. But it allows you to be conditional on literally anything in the game, including player inventories, location, costume, whether or not someone has been set on fire, etc."	t5_2u5zi	True

The biggest hurdles of a ""crafting system"" for Hawkthorne I can see:

* what we should make into interactive objects
* what 'recipes' are allowed from these objects that make something useful
* what found/generated items *do* in the game

All of this stuff is conceptual, and if we (as a community) figure it out while the programmers are nailing down the implementation elements of the game, we can help them with the design!

Inspired by the ""hawkthorneStoryDev"" wiki, I've designed a ""HawkthorneCraftDev"" wiki with templates and a few sample items/recipes from the episode.

I tried to keep her tone of voice kind of medieval videogame-y (like telling of legends or mythological hearsay), and also use it to give indirect information about the town/townspeople, other islands, some weapon and potion recipes, etc. 

It's not completely done yet, mostly because of things like I couldn't quite figure out what she should say about the list of birds at the very beginning of the list, like why would all those different types of birds would be important to the game? I don't know yet. And some are just weird, like ""brick vouchers"", but hopefully I'll be able to see a connection somewhere that Hilda would find necessary to explain to you. 

And also, this is just the beginning. Every NPC will have to have a dialogue tree. Perhaps, though, not as extensive or random as Hilda.

&gt;##Your Thoughts 

&amp;nbsp;

***1.  Leveling System***

Yes, you've heard me right! One of our contributors are working on leveling code that will allow the player to gain experience and move up levels. 

*However.*

Our devs are currently divided over this issue. Many of us feel that hawkthorne is a platformer foremost and should have no leveling system, while the rest feel that it is an RPG foremost and will have no problem having a leveling system. 

What we really need is a clear roadmap and forethought into how leveling should affect gameplay. What we are currently thinking on is that it is going to be pseudo-leveling, where one does not gain experience to gain higher health, more damage etc., but will unlock more platformer-related skills, similar to the Metroid game series. 

Some of these platform skills include :

* Higher jumping
* Slide attacks
* Creating a temporary platform midair (might not happen)
* Temporary shield to negate damage

and etc.

Please post your thoughts below in the comments, whether you think we should try a different approach to leveling, or if you have any more ideas for the platformer-related skills!

(Note: Keep in mind that this might not even happen at all if most of our devs are opposed)

&gt;##General Stuff

1. Freaky Friday episode was amazing. #jimrashforshowrunner

1. Please, help out with filling up our [Hilda dialogues!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCFeTzmg4yCXU5BqnaRFwVlOeEl6CtUoCEG2Vbume90/edit). Please, exercise your wittiness and add to that document above, it is probably the easiest way to contribute to the game. 

1. I'd like to welcome daniwa and bucketh3ad in joining our newest dev team. Now more people we can pawn responsibility off to!

1. I have suspended my thoughts about a possible story dev team for now. We should wait until the game is much more mature.

1. Holy god, I think I hate fish more than bats now. Bats are tolerable now, fish are the pizza burns on the roof of the world's mouth.

1. Do people actually read this section? Let alone this post at all? I'll do a quick test, the first three to comment saying ""thumb in a turtleneck"" shall get a grateful upvote from me, and abuse my powers and hide your usernames somewhere in the game as an easter egg.

&gt;##Suggestion Box

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully you all know how the drill goes. What we're doing is asking for any kind of suggestion from the community, and if it's an idea that is reasonable and doable, we'll actually attempt to implement it by the next release. 

Again, not only suggestions, but we also welcome any kind of criticisms/complaints/comments/opinions/queries/marriage proposals/reviews. Please don't hesitate to post your thoughts below in the comments!

anyways....


I was told that the black caverns and Valley of laziness, would have something very similar to Super Mario World when he enters a cave it opens up to a new area with levels. I figured why doesn't the Forest/Gay Islands also get that treatment.. two levels isnt really enough to make it feel like a ""World"" so i added additional levels to make it feel like it has some meat to it.. i wrote a level descriptions and key parts in it to some degree (some more than others) including bosses or how the level should be played. so some story element has been added. First of all for fans that want to add the dean as the boss in the gay islands or Vaughn as the hippie boss in the forest will be disappointed as i have made this with the thought of it being a CORNELIUS style game (so maybe some offense later.. sorry if you are). I figure Mega-Dean and the like can be added in Abed's Computer section to satisfy both types of fans of the game.. Let's begin with the forest level.


[You might want to open this](http://i.imgur.com/yZR4m.png) and look at it and read along with this. When the player enters the Forest and click on the current ""Forest 1""  they will be taken to what youre looking at.. but more colorful. The names of the levels will probably be change due to lack of creativity for it.



**Stage 1 - The Deep Dark Forest**
- Intro level [seen in game] - players meet Cornelius &amp; Gilbert, a pretty basic level here.. just what you have seen already on the show. level is really short.


**Stage 2 - The Deep Dark Forest Paths**
- Here we can have players fight critters and enemies. another basic level kinda like our current Forest 2, but longer and maybe a little challenging ie: enemies, more pits.. speaking of pits, 1 of the pits will lead to a secret area and not to the players death. The secret area leads to the dark forest, but the player cannot currently enter it as there is a magically force field. This section will not be available to the White Crystal is freed from the black caverns, and Gilbert kills them and they have to restart. For now the player is suppose to go the regular path leading to The Deep Forest section.


**Stage 3 - The Deep Forest Hills**
- Players slowly but steadily climb up the hills. Similar to Contra when the players climb hills falling off the screen will lead to death, once the player reaches the top the level is over. Maybe a cutscene of them.


**Stage 4 - The Deep Forest Falls**
- The players are on top of the hills jumping over the waterfalls on top of rocks, when all of a sudden the player is bull-dozed of the last rock by a dark blurry pixelated image. Knocked off the waterfall, the player must avoid crashing into rocks, branches, and enemies. once the player falls all the way to the bottom of waterfall out of sight. the player finishes the level and goes to next area.


**Stage 5 - The Deep Forest Lake**
- The player is seen unconscious on a piece of bark, washed up ashore against a house in the middle of the lake (like the Angry Beavers [tv show] house.) Cutscene = The players see a Jet Ski, Speed Boat, and a mysterious item locked up in a cage outside the house, the players knocked on the door, but it pushes open unlocked. Inside the house players can heal/rest, stock up on items, and read interesting stuff. After rummaging through the house, you find out its Mallows house, and that he went to his Marshes to take out the Great Forest Beast. Finding the keys you find out it only unlocks the cage (not the jet ski/boat) inside the cage is a raft (like Zelda 1/Cast Away) but with a water gun mounted on it. The player hops on and now goes down the lake with the raft taking out enemies while the slowly leave.


**Stage 6 - The Deep Forest Marshes**
- Once the lake water starts turning greenish and cant go any further the players now arrive the Marshes. Players must avoid the greenish water by jumping on rocks and branches. eventually players notice Mallow on the ground, he begs you to defeat the beast for him, he keeps knocking off things off the waterfall and it keeps crashing into his house, and keeps terrorizing him and his pet Beaverton. 

**BOSS BATTLE** - The Great Forest Critter -
The boss is a combination of a body of a bear, raccoon eyes, deer horns, rabbit tail, bird wings, fox head, skunk colors, porcupine back, and any other forest critter. He's the one that been leading the evil creatures to attack you. The player cannot jump on him due to his horns and therefore must stock up on the silver leafs on the trees on the sides of the fighting battle area and jump over him with he charges at you or flies at you causing him to crash into the rock, dropping rock pieces for the player to collect.  combining silver leafs and rocks create Silver Arrows which can kill it. When defeated he falls into the toxic marsh and slowly dies, Mallow gives you thanks and $100 and then calls for his helicopter which his pet Beaverton is flying, they both then fly off. Ending the level.


**Stage 7 - The Deep Dark Forest Passings**
- basically just a basic forest level to end the forest and transitioned to the town. some enemies, but mainly an area to get a quick cheap unfair death, also traps or something the town has placed, maybe also a giant fence to keep the bad creatures from entering the town.




*2ND PLAYTHROUGH*
- all 2nd playthroughs are after the white crystal is freed, but the levels have been upgraded in difficulty whether more enemies, different enemies or enemies take more damage to kill and more damage from you.
ALL LEVELS FROM 1-7 have less trees or all trees are cut down. i will only put the level description again down here to talk about the differences between the first run and second run (Note Corneilus &amp; Gilbert wont be in the first level but its basically the same now as it was then besides less trees)




**Stage 2B - The Deep Dark Forest Paths**
- here it is basically the same except now the secret pathway to the dark forest is open which i will talk about later if the player chooses to go that way, but it will be like the first time except harder enemies if the player continues the same way they went first. 


**Stage 4B - The Deep Forest Falls**
- the rock where you were blind-sided and bull-dozed by the Great Forest Critter is now safe to land on without fear. but this time after you land the next time you jump will activate the rock to fall off the waterfall causing the player to dodge once again down the waterfall.


**Stage 5B - The Deep Forest Lake**
- Reaching Mallows lake house for the second time, Beaverton is there to tell you Mallow has gone off to go deal with the lost crazy women of the forest (the ones Hilda mentions she'll become) he states since the trees have been cut, they have been seen around his property and his marshes. Beaverton offers you aid for your journey to anything in the house, when you agree to help. Beaverton gives you the keys to the helicopter as well as, the speed boat, jet ski, and raft. the helicopter will blow up and damage the player, speedboat has no gas, jet ski sinks as soon as started, player is force to take the trusty raft again. Beaverton is seen laughing at you in the window.


**Stage 6B - The Deep Forest Marshes**
- player is force to make harder jumps with no branches and just tree stumps. player notices Mallow on the ground again this time unconscious. After arguing with the tribal women to leave the area and Mallow alone, the leader of the lost women becomes hysterical and jumps into the marsh at the exact same place where the Great Forest Critter rotting carcass fell. The lost woman turns into a hideous mutant monster.

**BOSS BATTLE** - Giant Mutant Lost Woman -
haven't really thought this fight out..
once you defeat her, Mallow wakes up and begs you to stop as he loves the women and has agreed to take them all as his wives. he gives you a cool $200 to leave him with his women and 1 mutant.


**Stage 7B - The Deep Dark Forest Passings**
- very similar except the traps and giant wall have been upgraded made out of shiny metal.


**Stage 8 - The Dark Forests' Lost Woods**
- This is the path people can take from stage 2 if they find the secret area and the white crystal has been removed from the black caverns. Now that the cursed woods magic is weakened, the player can walk through the force field. The lost woods is similar to level 2, but darker, twice as hard and scary, set at night... these trees have not been cut like the other areas have been


**Stage 9 - The Dark Forests Creepy Swamp**
- Similar to the first Marsh level, but really hard and set with fog to make it harder to see. At the end of the swamp leads to what looks to be some type of ruins.


**Stage 10 - The Dark Forest Temple**
- upon entering the temple the player hears a voice in their head from the Great Warlock, Warcraft. Warcraft warns them to leave. The temple is a very big confusing level forcing players to find keys and switches to unlock new areas. Once the player finds the throne room the player meets Warcraft and his little tree pet, Monstrosa (like the size of a Pikachu) Warcraft then laughs as he tells you youre about to meet your end.

**BOSS BATTLE** - Warcraft, the Warlock
Warcraft becomes on fire and shoots fireballs straight at you, turns to electricity and  lightning to fall on certain spots on the ground. or is regular and shoots his 1-shot Death shot, this is where the player must dodge this shot and get to jump on him, its his only weak spot. as if the player tries other times they will take damage.

After you defeat him, you walk up to tree who is crying, Warcraft will attempt one last death shot, if it hits you, you die, but if you jump it hits Monstrosa, transforming him into a Giant Scary looking Tree Monster

**BOSS BATTLE** - Monstrosa Tree
The first part of the battle is for you to reason with it as it chases you breaking through the Temple. The tree chases you through the forest, with some pits and enemies to get in your way, It chases you all the way to a dead end, a rock wall. [now im not sure on how you defeat him, you cant burn him as you need to climb him to get out of there, maybe plucking all his leafs or something. idk] after it is defeated Monstrosa falls against the wall letting the player climb on top of him and over it. The next stage will be Stage 7B from here just the entrance maybe somewhere different idk.



And thats the Forest area, Part 1 when you start the game and Part 2 after Gilbert defeats you after you get the White Crystal.. hope you like it and look for the Village of Laziness Post in a little bit.. this one was too long and will just post it in a new one.. if you didnt like it im sorry i took so much of your time, i really like my village of laziness too maybe better but dont know if you care to give that a chance.. if you did like it i hope youll like the village of laziness one too.

I posted a stripped-down version of the game that takes you right to the turkey boss, and lowers his health so you can loot the white crystal easily. 

You cannot do much else besides looting the crystal, so don't expect it to work very well!

I noticed a Fat Neil/Duquesne flair in the sidebar, and I'm wondering if a WIP of the costume existed anywhere because it's actually a better looking design than what I can think of (Granted, I'd probably change the color of the cloak to something more ""elven"" and ""windy-walky"", like green with white or light blue accents), and I hope to finish that up soon. 

'Sides, I can't do Pierce The Dickish until Duquesne is done, since he has to have the same cloak and sword.

...Actually, maybe I should make the Sword of Duquesne look more like one of the many swords already in game (I think sword_2.png looks like something he'd use. Sword_3 is too...demonic. It looks more like something Draconis would reward, but I'm just thinking out loud). Yay/nay?

1366662614.0	1cvx3i	Making costumes the easy way	edisonout	19	2	9	"You may have noticed Reddfawks churning out loads of awesome costumes recently and some of you have been wondering how she does it and the answer is simple - **body parts**, **layers** and a lot of *copy &amp; paste**.

Split up your character into component body parts - head, legs, arms, body, accents etc. and then paste them onto separate layers of your costume image.

**HOW IT WORKS** 

* [This is Pierce's base split up for example](http://i.imgur.com/WCntcLu.png)
* [Changing to  Teddy Pierce costume](http://i.imgur.com/Aji73lq.png)
* Then within five minutes of creating that, I have [Teddy Pierce sprite sheet](http://i.imgur.com/d3b99LZ.png)

Now, I can double the number of finished sprites purely by flipping and there are many other positions I can reuse the hands, body, head &amp; legs and then it's only a few small tweaks for the more awkward poses.

So you go from having hundreds of sprites to do, down to dozens.

I currently have a way to add spawn chances per-node via the node properties in the level definitions, I think this method would be the best way so you can define static spawn locations vs. ones based on chance.

I'd like to extend a HUGE thanks to someone on the RPGmaker forums who had some tips on making curly hair on such a small sprite. They said to section it like you would if you were drawing a brain and add lots of highlights. When you zoom out to 100%, it looks like the hair is more curled - especially in characters with dark hair.

I wanted to get Shirley's hair right, and I'd already re-watched Horror Fiction In Seven Spooky Steps a bajillion times over, so why not? Like Annie-Wolf and Thoraxis, I took MAJOR liberties with this one. In the episode she's just surrounded by sparkles, but my first draft made it look too much like the flaking powder I put on the monkey gassed Jeff, so I decided to give her a halo and little wings out of the light specks. Imagine how awesome it will look in Cornelius' Castle or any other lowlight situation!

(And when I finish this, I allow you all to use the hair on these sprites to make any other of the costumes Shirley has with her hair down) =)"	t5_2u5zi	True

1353398749.0	13i10e	[Suggestions] Combo's, Extra Lives, and Badguy Respawns	cammo_1234	21	2	1	"Recently I've dusted of my old NES and have been soaking up some classic 8-bit gaming nostalgia. So I've come across a couple of classic platformer mechanics I think would make great future additions.

Now that we are getting rewards for killing hippies, I think we should add a combo multiplier mechanic. So if you manage to bounce on a bunch of hippies in a row (without touching the ground) you are rewarded with more sweet, sweet coinage for each successive bounce. And after a set number of successive bounces, you are rewarded with a delicious 1up. A few old-school games employ this type of reward system, and I feel it will give our game an added level of 8-bit authenticity.

Perhaps this idea can be adapted to work with various weapons once they are added.

My second idea is that badguys should have the capability to respawn once the player has moved a sufficient distance away from them. This could either make farming for gold easier, or make turning back in a level a tough decision, depending on the characteristics of the badguys.

First, I just want to say that this game is absolutely fantastic, and the best way to kill time probably ever :) Second, there is a bug on the Windows 64-bit version that wasn't in the last version of the game I had (v0.0.79): I enter the parking lot but can't move through it! I just get sent back out to the campus. I don't think there's too much there I'm missing so it's definitely not life shattering, but just wanted to put it out there :P I'd fix it, but the last thing I ever programmed was an awful version of Frogger with a Black Eyed Peas soundtrack :( 	t5_2u5zi	True
1371938371.0	1gvkxi	Suggestions for level features	edisonout	19	1	11	"Here's a list of possible new features for levels. Feel free to add your own or comment on the ones already suggested. I'm willing to bet some of these can't be implemented but don't worry about feasibility for now. What would make the levels more exciting or challenging?

##SUGGESTIONS

**MOVING PLATFORMS**

* move in a cirle or a route that isn't a straight line
* disappearing platforms
* continuous loop of platforms which run in opposite direction to level direction
* droppable floors
* disappearing floors (maybe one plank at a time)
* vertical platform you have to interact with to turn it horizontal so you can jump on it


~~IMPEDENCES~~ HAZARDS

* things that explode occasionally
* things that drop from the ceiling (loose icicles)
* big blocks which come down and smash you
* things on the floor to jump over  - flames, spinning wheels, mines, hot pipes, spikes, steam - could pop up occasionally rather than be constant
* rolling boulders
* poisoned darts/blow holes


**ENEMIES**

* swinging enemies
* enemies which can only harm you / you can only harm them when they're in a certain state
* enemies you have to attack before you can jump on them (maybe they curl up into a ball / flip onto their back exposing a weakness? - have spikes/hors or similar to show where they're dangerous). Maybe arrows only work if the enemy is standing upright?
* enemies throwing stuff at you - grendades, darts, logs you have to jump over - some constantly chucking stuff, others only when you're in the proximity
* enemies with a temporary force field around them / have something local stopping you attacking them from in front, maybe they're using a flamethrower
* variety of methods of killing - some jump only, others weapons, others attack, others combo of the above
* some only injure you if in certain states
* enemies which are particularly vunerable to certain weapons

**OTHER LEVEL FEATURES**

* dips to hide in while something dangerous flies past
* speed up down some slopes? slow down climbing slopes?
* darkness - can only see a few blocks ahead
* levers to active platforms / bouncy areas / hidden doors etc.
* boost pads
* periodically electricuted floor - something that regularly switchs between killing you and being safe
* things in foreground to partially obscure view such as fences/icicles/stalagmites
* conveyor belts
* climbable walls you can traverse sideways

**CHARACTER ACTIONS**

* pushing &amp; pulling
* crawling
* sliding

**WEAPON TYPES**

* bombs

##HAVE A GO AT MAKING LEVELS YOURSELF

You'll need to 

1. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey#contribute-to-the-game) on creating a copy of the game on your machine
2. Install [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) - the program that runs the game
3. Install [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) - the editor we use for creating levels
4. Check out our [level creation guide](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Level-creation-guide)

We only have 1 level designer (the awesome /u/didory123 ) so we'll be thrilled to have absolutely anyone else contribute. If you have any questions, can't work out how to get everything set up, have problems with github or tiled either message the mods or hop onto IRC and we'll help you out.

##TEST THESE IDEAS OUT

I've started creating mock-up levels featuring these ideas individually in a very hacky manner, using code we already have so we can see them in action before we make any decisions or implement them properly. If you'd like to play them, follow steps 1 &amp; 2 above (i.e. clone the game from GitHub &amp; install love2d).  

The process of then testing out my levels is quite simple but may seem complicated at first. Trust me, it makes more sense when you're doing it. Hop onto IRC if you are having problems following.

* Open powershell (windows) or terminal (mac), making sure you're at [master]. For each of the commands below, enter them exactly as shown and then hit enter
* One time only - add me as a remote. This just tells your compuer where my version of the game is saved.

&gt;git remote add edisonout https://github.com/edisonout/hawkthorne-journey.git

* Get my version

&gt;git fetch edisonout

* Check out my level test branch

&gt; git checkout edisonout/winterideas

* Convert the map files so love can read them - this will take several minutes the first time you do this since it will also convert the 30 odd levels we have in the game too. You only need to do this step if you edit a level (.tmx) file.

&gt;make (for mac &amp; linux users)

&gt;.\make.ps1 (for windows)

* start a level

&gt;love src -l test1

##ISSUES WITH WHITE CRYSTAL

Unrelated but if you have problems with the game crashing when you try to pick up the white crytal, please [check out this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/1gttz0/if_youre_crashing_when_looting_the_white_crystal/). We think we've found the bug that's causing it but no one on the dev team has ever had this issue so we can't confirm that it works. Please download the game, unzip it &amp; try to pick it up.

This has now been coded and looks [like this](http://imgur.com/a/u8qlS). The general idea is that the left hand page displays a scrolling list of the character's costumes, while the right hand side acts as a yearbook page, each focusing on a different theme or category such as ""Paintball"", ""Halloween"" or ""Christmas"".

We'd like some help either generating new ""photos"" or putting an entire page together. Also included in the link above is a blank page so you know what size to work to &amp; several example photographs - photos don't have to be of the whole group, they can have as many or few characters in as you'd like.

The following items are issues which are are keeping us from getting to version 0.1.0 (I'll be adding more stuff as we encounter development hang ups):

* Create Castle Hawkthorne Tileset and Level sprites tileset(http://i.imgur.com/nM6Vp.png)
    
   Derferman added a [stitch of the level](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/383#issuecomment-9627116) and [the entrance](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/387)

* Create Seabluff Tileset and Level sprites tileset

    Derferman added a [stitch of the level](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues/386)

There are a few things in code that are currently being worked on, but I really believe programmatically we're getting close to the milestone.

If you haven't developed a level before, it's surprisingly easy once you get started. I highly recommend downloading [PyxelEdit](http://pyxeledit.com/) and/or [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) and start getting your hands dirty. Both programs are really great. If you have questions on how to use them, feel free to ask.

Each main character now has their own tab, with costumes ordered by episode number. Other characters share a tab and are listed alphabetically.

EDIT: [Guide to using new spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Byjjb3K3J96WuV4n7S0JyFQ2GAwqO9RpTQ4Wye9XJeU/edit)

**Checking the sheets** (for checkers)

I propose a new way of checking characters involving a coloring system.

* When a costume sheet is submitted, the spreadsheet row is highlighted YELLOW

* Someone comes along and checks the costume ([See here for issues to check](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/zh3f9/wanted_costume_qa_reviewers/)). If it is ready to go in the game, highlight the row ORANGE. If there are issues, highlight the row BLUE and put a comment in the notes column. When this issue has been corrected, change back to YELLOW to ensure no other issues have been missed.

* Costumes in the game have their row highlighted GREEN.

I also have several rows highlighted GREY - these are additional sheets for secondary characters which can't be completed until the initial character sprite sheet is complete.

If we can get a small group of people going through the spreadsheet and checking newly updated sprites (and/or fixing issues) that would be great. Then, regularly, someone can check for orange cells and  submit a pull request as appropriate.



**Updating costumes** (for everyone)

If a row isn't highlighted, that means the costume needs to be completed - if there are names, check if they're still working on it to avoid duplicated. From now on, please add a date when you assign yourself to a costume. Some have been sitting around uncompleted for months.

Continue adding new costume ideas as you remember them - filling in the appropriate episode slot / inserting new lines if there are multiple costumes per episode. Miscellaneous costumes which don't fit an episode (e.g. Childish Gambino) can go at the bottom of the list.



**TL:DR**

New spreadsheet - 1 tab per character. 

New colorcode: Green - in game, orange - ready to go in game, yellow - complete but unchecked, blue - issues, grey - waiting for character sprite sheet to be complete, white - please complete the sprite sheet

~~Please can whoever's in charge of the spreadsheets update the links/merge this spreadsheet into the current one as appropriate. Thank you.~~ New spreadsheet in use.

1345055039.0	y9uwn	Player choices in the story	Eldagusto	17	1	2	I feel that the players should have options that effect the story of the game.  Such as choosing whether to side with Gilbert at the End or not.  Possibly have different Character Endings depending on how the game goes.  Maybe Gilbert gives a boon to the character that scores the finishing blow.  And if you choose to take the throne maybe each individual has a Darkest Timeline Ending where they are King?	t5_2u5zi	True

In the overworld in the episode, we see little flags go up whenever a level is completed (very Super Mario Bros.). We could probably have a flag post at the end of each level to mark the end of it or something like that, but in addition to that we could have a separate goal for each level. What I was thinking is that each level could have three Hawthorne wipes that need to be collected, kind of like the big coins in New Super Mario Bros. They may be out in plain sight or hidden, and it's not necessary to collect them all in order to continue to the next level, but collecting them may lead to unlocking a secret world, for example, or perhaps just unlocking new costumes.

Additionally, collecting the Hawthorne wipes would become increasingly difficult. For instance, it might be necessary to return to previous levels with new items or abilities in order to get some of wipes the player couldn't get the first time through. This way, players are encouraged to return to previous locations."	t5_2u5zi	True

1340617270.0	vkd4g	[WIP] Simmons (Boss Character)	SimmonsIsFinished	18	1	10	"This is my first time making a character and know it probably not that good, but having fun doing it; maybe somebody with better talent at this can work with it and make it usable...

* - yesterday i made the one facing forward, today the one in a 3/4 angle to look more like the characters in the game; hopefully its better

Idea: so before the main characters reach the black caves via gay island route, they take a wheelchair across the ocean... maybe simmons can be a boss before hand, he can try to run over the player but also he can leap out of his chair to hit unsuspecting player who try to jump on/over him.. idk... hopefully you guys like it


** -6/27 - I continually have been updating the sprites... i just rewatch the debate episode and took alot of screen shots to try and perfect simmons and his chair (6 wheels).. so there will be more updates and versions to come. so hopefully if you've been enjoying them, they will come out even better; and if you haven't been enjoying the sprites hopefully you'll like the new direction i'll be taking for the next few days..
