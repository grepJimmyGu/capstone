1358781363.0	16zol8	Community garden got raided	ca3799	375	60	223	"I am conflicted. 

I have one private bed and 5 donation beds at my church community garden. There are about 30 beds in all, and most are privately owned and managed and there is a small monthly fee to keep a bed. The church gave me the empty beds at no charge and the teens and I do all the work and provide the seeds. When we donate, we credit the church.

Apparently, after services yesterday, someone in the church invited the visitors to help themselves to things in the garden. I guess. I don't know this for sure.

As I was walking out to check on my beds, I was at first happy to see so many folks out there thinking it was the owners of the beds and we could chat about our spring plans. But as I got closer, I realized they were all strangers and they were having a field day helping themselves to stuff all over the garden- the private and the donation beds. 

I was kinda torn- I felt like saying ""Hey- who are you people and what are you doing?"" Instead, I said ""hey, are you interested in gardening. These are the private beds and these are the beds we use to donate to the food bank. Two families left immediately, but one guy had his arms just stuffed with things. 

I could see they were damaging the plants by pulling off beans. One guy was pulling cabbages out by the roots with his feet in the bed and damaging the roots of nearby cabbages in the process. A girl was pulling up whole handfuls of carrots and just dropping them on the ground. I said ""Hey, you dropped those carrots"" and she replied ""Well, I don't really like carrots all that much."" I asked ""Why are you picking them then? If you pick them, you need to take them home and eat them."" Her mom came up holding a whole cauliflower plant by the roots. The cauliflower is not producing yet- it didn't even have a small head on it- and told me she was a home-care nurse and wondered how she could get produce for her home-bound clients. I suggested she connect them with the senior program at the food bank or take one of the available beds- ""It's easy and rewarding!"" I said hopefully, but she said she lived too far away.

In the meantime, someone came up behind me and started pulling carrots and onions from my private bed, so I went back and did the same 'these are the private beds and these are the donation beds' schtick.
I dunno. I was just shocked. Who in their right mind would think it proper to just go out to a garden and take away arm-loads of stuff?

Later on in the day, my kids and I went back to survey the damage- carrot carnage: carrots laying everywhere, holes in the ground where whole plants were yanked up, cabbage leaves laying around, broken branches. Half an oregano plant pulled up. Ugh. "	t5_2qhkh	True

I bought an old kitchen table at a garage sale years ago and put wheels on it so I could switch the sides every other day so all plants got some sun. I would get great germination, and then long leggy weak plants would develop and were not famous for making the transplant successfully.

a few years ago i was standing in a hoop greenhouse and the huge fans were on and it was only maybe 60 degrees. it finally dawned on me that the fans were not on for temp control, but to create a wind so the plants had some movement to them, thus creating a stronger and much more vibrant plant.

since then, i've turned the ceiling fan on high for a couple of hours each day when i'm starting seeds and the result is amazing. strong stems, no leggy weak plants and they for the most part, always transplant well.

it's sort of a parable of life.....the things that challenge us make us stronger."	t5_2qhkh	True

I had purchased some bamboo seeds (phyllostachys pubescens) from a seller in China. Turns out, they're a ""controlled substance"" and are illegal to import due to the potential diseases. Completely blew my mind. 

Of the seeds I bought, only 2 had germinated, so they seized those to be destroyed. They were being grown indoors in pots, to remain indoors for decoration. No fines or anything fortunately, just out the cost of the seeds. They said I should be able to request a refund, but good luck with that. 

Not really much else to say, but just a word of warning for anyone buying seeds or plants online. From what I can gather, the only illegality is the importing. It's perfectly fine to grow some I obtain from a local source.  I'm really bummed since it took a lot of effort to get those 2 to germinate, and they were doing really well. "	t5_2qhkh	True

1305817799.0	hf32h	I've grown chilli plants exclusively for the last 3 years; here are some of the things I have noticed about gardening :) 	omen2k	212	24	68	"Please excuse me if I get a little poetic here but I wanted to share with you all as I only found out about the subreddit a few weeks ago :) 

Things I've learned about gardening: 

* It gives you another sense of time that spans past months and gives you a real appreciation for the seasons that other people won't have.

* You will actually take notice of the weather. You'll notice when it rains and can remember off the top of your head when it last rained. You'll even be able to recall how much or how hard. 

* When you get up in the morning to have your coffee, you will go outside and check all your plants in turn, and gradually you'll begin to get a feel for the minute details that indicate that the plant needs more water, needs more shade, or what stage it's at in terms of fruition, all like some kind of biological twitter feed. This will be immensely satisfying for you. 

* It gives you a personal relationship with food; and you will actually pay attention to the taste of what you're eating rather than just shovelling it into your mouth. 

* Gives you the unique insight that freshly picked anything is 1000x more tasty and interesting than store bought anything; you will truly taste tomato for the first time in your life. 

* You get to see the world from a new point of view (a plants point of view). You'll see them adapt to the local environmental conditions in ingenious ways; for instance my chilli plants form more aerodynamically shaped leaves compared to those grown inside and are far more bushy. 

* Humans have had agriculture for thousands and thousands of years; we're wired to do it. By growing things you're tapping into an otherwise forgotten instinct. Growing things is just plain good for the soul and wonderful for your mental well-being. 

* By growing things, you're inserting yourself into the local ecosystem; you'll get to watch as bees dutifully pollinate your plants, insects will come to eat them and other insects will eat those insects, and dragonflies fight over the highest perch. All because you set up some real estate for them. All life needs to flourish is for one of us meddling humans to plant a few seeds. 

* Look at the pile of biomass you made. All of that took carbon, and that carbon came from the atmosphere. And you took it out of the air. Good for you!

Arbor Day Foundation does good work overall, but they are distributing a tree that's bad for MO and bad for St Louis. If the MO Botanical Garden is discouraging their members from planting this tree, Arbor Day should not be encouraging people to plant it.

if you get trees from them, make sure you are getting ones that arne't going to crowd out local native plants.  "	t5_2qhkh	True

1360453228.0	187vge	So, a group of kids just destroyed my entire vegetable garden...	lazypirate1	194	39	273	"I started my garden in June, and I've worked on it daily since. I had strawberries, three kinds of peppers, four varieties of tomatoes, all destroyed. The parents were nasty to me, not that I was very nice to them. I filed a police report. I'm crushed. I think I'm going to mulch over everything and give up. All my hard work, gone. What would you do? Anybody been through this before? 

**Edit**: Thank you SO MUCH for your advice and support. I am reconsidering pressing charges, but I've also concluded that I don't ever want to see those kids or their parents again, so getting them to replant isn't something that would work for me. I need to move past this and figure out what and when I'll replant. My son was also devastated by the vandalism, and this has been particularly difficult to explain to him. He's autistic, and the garden has been therapeutic for him as well. 

I will replant, thank you for the encouragement, but I'll definitely need some time to plan for a well-defended garden. Thank you all for your suggestions on that end, too. I'll update when/if it all comes together.

**Edit 2**: Thank you again for your encouragement. My son and I are working on the garden this morning! I can't sit around and mope when my child needs this as much as I do.

I tossed out most of my tomato plants and pepper plants, but my carrots and kohlrabi were unscathed. My son and I harvested what we could, and now we're planning our new garden. For garden defenses, I'm using the pepper oil spray for pests, I'm submitting a proposal for a fence, and I'm setting aside money for a video or camera surveillance system. I'm researching that now.

The lesson I'm learning is to be proactive instead of reactive, to expect pests of all species, and to better defend my garden against them. That doesn't excuse the kids or the parents for trespass, vandalism and theft, but it does give me the opportunity to keep my garden the stress-free sanctuary that it has been for my son and I. Hopefully, I'll be able to pass along your advice to other gardeners so that they won't have to deal with this kind of problem. "	t5_2qhkh	True

Go to Lowes and buy a T12 Flourescent fixture like [this](http://www.coxhardware.com/images/Product/medium/3006855.png)

The fixture cost about $10 and the bulbs will cost you another 10. This is one of the best purchases I've made in regards to starting seeds indoors. Keep the lights about an inch or two above your seedlings and you'll notice that your plants will come up more stout and sturdy than before. Hardening is easier too.

Now if you want to spend a little more, I would recommend T5 lights, but for the budget conscious among us, the T12s are great.

I hope this helps someone! "	t5_2qhkh	True

Last year (out first year in the house) we had people come to the door pretty regularly asking if they could have some pears, to which we were neighborly and allowed to pick pears. At some point one of them must have come back with a ladder because when we went out there to pick some for ourselves the tree was completely bare. Needless to say we were disappointed that we got 1 underripe pear out of the whole season.

Now today, the first of those knocks comes and I tell them no, we are not giving away our pears this year because we didn't get any of them last year. My boyfriend said it was bitchy, but I am pretty sure it was the same people who picked us out of them last year, and there is no way they ate all those pears themselves, and why should they be allowed to profit from out fruits?

I know they can just wait till we aren't home and rob us of our fruits then, but I refuse to let people sell our fruits this year! I will gladly share them with any person in my life that wants some, but not random people who come knocking on my door wanting them.

Sorry to rant, maybe I am a bit cranky today.

tl;dr People took all our pears last year, refuse to share this year."	t5_2qhkh	True

My small city backyard has been an empty desert for three years (since we bought our home).  This year I became pregnant with what will be our second and last child.  I wanted a place for the baby to play and be safe and happy.  We built a dog run, tilled and planted grass seed, planted four dwarf fruit trees, and I went a bit crazy with potted plants.  I found this community and have lurked for months.  This morning I couldn't help but smile as I woke to two tiny freshly clipped roses in a jar that my son decided were pretty.  It may be the pregnancy hormones, but to know my small rose bushes are bringing our house and family pleasure makes me so happy.  "	t5_2qhkh	True
