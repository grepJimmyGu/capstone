The man fought on a different level. He went undefeated for 16 UFC  fights and defended his title 10 times. He was the greatest pound for pound fighter on the planet. He couldn't be touched.

When it was Anderson Silva fight night, I was like a kid on Christmas. I don't get excited for much like that anymore. His fights were something to see, something I'll probably tell stories about to my grandkids years from now.

People love to hate on him. Fine, I don't want to have that discussion here. He had his style, his strengths, and his approach, and that's what carried him on this long. 

It's the end of an era, and a part of the greatness that is the UFC has died. But it was good while it lasted.

First of all, I'm not making this post to mock this man, Kyle Maynard, who is an author, public speaker and athlete. Clearly he got some balls. And sure, he got dealt a shitty hand in life but he makes the best of his situation. The target of my confusion/critique is the people surrounding this fight.

Who grants this man a fighting license, when fighting consists of using your ARMS and LEGS, and clearly he has none of those. What comission allows this to take place?

Also, who the fuck agrees to fight a man like that? Clearly this is not a WWE show, circus act or charity fight, but a legit MMA bout. They're not even in the same weight class. And wouldn't it be more humane of the other guy to just finish the fight withing seconds instead of running around pity-jabbing Kyle occasionally?

I like Dylan Andrews but I am just excited about the potential in Hall and really don't want to be let down. Does anyone else feel this way? Do you think Uriah might choke? 

Spoiler below:



Btw I am glad Kev smashed josh. I felt like josh was hand picking fights and he was exposed by Kevin's pure determination and that he wasn't phased by the whole first round thing.


Edit 2: spoilers!

Holy shit... I can not believe how hard that was to watch. When Dylan's as getting peppered in the face I swear I felt every punch. Uriah is not someone who I like because of his personality or some other intangible. His skill is really I exciting to watch and his fights are absolutely brutal. I know it's because the talent pool on these competitions aren't absolutely top tier, but these guys are all good no matter what anyone says and hall makes them all look like amateurs.

Natural Born Killer is a fucking beast. I absolutely loved him throwing strikes from the bottom. His heart and grit were impressive as well. I think he's definitely #2 in the division and beats Hendricks and would beat Diaz in a rematch. Really, really impressed. His inability to get off his back really hurt him. Should be remain steadfast and diligent in his training, it would not be surprising in the least to see him win a rematch in KO/TKO fashion. 

GSP- great to have GSP back! He looked fit and conditioned, as usual. His power was a little lacking in this fight. Definitely showed he needs to work on that, outside the jab, his other shots looked pretty blah IMO. SO MUCH HEART, and have the wherewithal to defend after taking that HUGE kick to head. Really just an awesome return to the octagon for him. I don't think he should take the super fight, I think A. Silva would really hurt him, badly."	t5_2qsev	True

Kelvin did a great job in the first round but Uriah definitely dominated the second and while he was taken down in the 3rd I think he was the more effective fighter. It literally could have came down to that one last take down that won it for kelvin but who knows. Either way I was really happy with the fight.

Right now I was confused as I couldn't open up the UFC 155 ppv page. It turns out it was deleted by this wikipedia loser of a user who's been trying to remove UFC pages nonstop for a year. His argument is that the UFC pages are not ""relevant"" enough to be articles on Wikipedia, he compares UFC 155 to ""hundreds of sporting events"" that occur at the end of the year and UFC 155 therefore is not relevant for discussion.

I always thought Wikipedia was good at policing themselves but apparently I was dead wrong if some idiot can get a page deleted (this is despite other users outnumbering him and trying to keep the page open) for some ridiculous reason. UFC 156 news page is also on the verge of being deleted. 

I bring this to your attention in the hopes that others here are better versed at using Wikipedia and can fight this guy's lame crusade against deleting UFC pages.

The reason why I say this is because of a degree of disappointment I have from two notions: the first is based on what Chael was saying about there being rigged fights in Pride and in the UFC. We don't know for sure but apparently he was fairly certain of it. But whatever, not a huge deal. The second is the fakeness of Sonnen's smack talking and animosity towards Jones. We saw that they got along just fine on TUF. And now that it's over and it's time to sell tickets, he has begun his verbal attack. But it just appears fake and vacuous. It's not borne out of any animosity towards Jones. And that's fine to not have any animosity, I think that's great. But for someone like Sonnen, having that seems important. He had a certain level of animosity towards Silva and he competed at a level that really tested Silva. To me it seems like he cares more about selling tickets and increasing his star status and his reputation than he cares specifically about winning.

**Associated Press Preview:**

Frank Mir is a two-time UFC heavyweight champion with more victories in the division than any fighter. That's why he knows it's never been tougher to pull off what he's trying to accomplish at UFC 146.

The UFC is going big in its Memorial Day weekend show, headlined by five heavyweight fights at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. Junior Dos Santos will make his first title defence against Mir, who marvels at the UFC's current roster of enormous fighters.

""The UFC has always had the best fighters in every weight, but typically in the heavyweight division, (only) the top five was dangerous guys fighting for the title,"" Mir said. ""The top 10, maybe you'd talk about them in the conversation. I don't think five or six years ago, we could have had a card that had five bouts of heavyweights fighting -- and then we've had injuries, too. If we'd had a card five years ago with five heavyweight fights and somebody got injured, the whole card would have had to be scrapped.""

Heavyweights jumped to the forefront of the UFC in recent years with the rise and fall of Brock Lesnar, who quit his pro wrestling career and made a high-profile run to the UFC title, stopping Mir (16-5) along the way in July 2009. Lesnar battled injuries and illness, but also struggled to compete with the new wave of dynamic talent arriving in the division, eventually retiring last December after getting pulverized by Alistair Overeem.

Mir's title shot would have belonged to Overeem, but the Dutch kickboxer failed a drug test, clearing the way for Mir to attempt to reclaim the heavyweight belt just two days after his 33rd birthday in a fight with Dos Santos, the Brazilian boxer with humble beginnings and a remarkable MMA pedigree.

""It's a huge moment in my life and career,"" Mir said. ""Eventually, one day we retire and we're forgotten as athletes, but people try to somehow make their mark on history. It'll give me something to brag about to my grandchildren. You know, one time, Grandpa could move from one side of the room to the other without hobbling.""

A card stacked with heavyweights is a first for mixed martial arts' dominant promotion, but all five matchups have changed since the fights were originally announced.

Roy Nelson fights Dave Herman, Shane Del Rosario takes on Stipe Miocic and 6-foot-11 Stefan Struve fights Lavar Johnson on the UFC's first pay-per-view show headlined by five heavyweight fights -- more than 2,400 pounds of mixed martial artists, according to UFC President Dana White.

Mir realizes the challenge of facing Dos Santos (14-1), who claimed the title last fall with a victory over Cain Velasquez. Mir is a skilled jiu-jitsu practitioner who broke the arm of Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, Dos Santos' friend and mentor, in their bout last December, the latest in a career filled with impressive submission victories.

Mir believes he's much better on the ground than Dos Santos, but the Brazilian has spent exactly 13 seconds on his back during his MMA career. Nobody has been able to take down Dos Santos, whose striking abilities make it dangerous to even get close enough to try.

""He's very impressive, and he's probably a better boxer than me, but so what?"" Mir asked. ""I know I'm better on the ground, and I've got to figure out a way to prove it, and I'm going to.""

The genial Dos Santos has exchanged some seemingly halfhearted trash talk with the erudite, loquacious Mir during the promotion of their bout, but he appears confident in his ability to outslug anybody after his 64-second victory over Velasquez. Dos Santos scoffs at the notion Overeem might have been a tougher matchup for him than Mir, who was stopped by punches in each of his five career defeats.

""I know he's a guy who has been around a long time and knows how to do everything,"" Dos Santos said. ""I'm going to see if he can handle what I can do, and I'm going to try to knock him out in the first two rounds.""

Moments before Dos Santos meets Mir, Velasquez (9-1) will attempt to get his career back on track when he meets Antonio Silva, the veteran Brazilian super heavyweight making his UFC debut. Velasquez, the former Arizona State wrestler, hasn't fought since Dos Santos pounded him in Anaheim last fall, blemishing his previously perfect record.

""I'm definitely able to let it go,"" Velasquez said. ""In wrestling, I've lost matches before, so it's always a thing where you learn from it. You just watch film, but you don't really keep it with you and always think about it. I wasn't thinking that I was going to go through my entire career undefeated.""

The undercard features popular middleweight Jason ""Mayhem"" Miller, who says he'll retire if he doesn't defeat C.B. Dollaway, another former Arizona State wrestler. Unbeaten lightweight Edson Barboza, English veteran Dan Hardy and former WEC featherweight champ Mike Brown also will fight at UFC 146."	t5_2qsev	True

It is great when guys touch gloves when the ref says, at the bell to start each round, and then a hug after. But how do you know each fighters limit? I guess you get those hugs at the start of the fifth round often enough, but it is risky.

Ever since Colton Smith pulled that takedown on TUF I realized how some dirty people may capitalize on people. There is a possibility someone will misunderstand (Mayweather/ Ortiz) and the more often you are doing this stuff the more likely it is to happen. It would suck to have somebody lose a fight getting knocked out because they were reaching out to say sorry for the nut shot that the opponent has recovered from.

Some fighters probably get irritated by it. Just because they are nice, they may want to turn up the intensity and run right out of the gates. Is it a big enough issue for the UFC to set limitations? Or is it even memo worthy?"	t5_2qsev	True

Jones is doing a great job as well, but there has already been a lot of media specials about him where you get to see him behind the scenes. You never get to see this side of Chael. His personality does a complete 180 when he's not hyping a fight. I'm especially impressed by his coaching. He really genuinely cares about his fighters. It's not his reputation that matters to him when it comes to them winning or losing. He gives really great advice and actually opens up to them personally so they can see that even those at the top still struggle. I went from really not liking the guy to actually kinda rooting for him.	t5_2qsev	True

Also, being the biggest Frank Mir fan. It was awesome seeing Mir's enemy crumble in such a way.

The event was in Anaheim, California and the majority were Velasquez fans so when he finished that fight the place erupted. As loud as I was screaming with excitement, I could not hear myself, that's how loud it was in there. For a few seconds after the fight my ears rung and then it showed Lesner's cheek gash on the big screen and all the cheers quickly changed to a ""ooooh"" and ""eeeeeew"" mixture.

Sometimes to the level where I would shake my head at the level of stupidity and lack of intelligence of the people who were supposed to be rolemodels on the show.

This year, however, it's been such a joy and relief to watch two coaches who are actually showing each other respect but also being 100% honest about their own but also the opponents fighters when interviewed after a match. I was 100% Jones coming into this season, and still am, but Chael has really grown on me. The level of coaching, teambuilding, overall insight and general honesty has really made me respect him even more - both as a person and as a fighter. Great season so far!

Problem is on top of the airfare, hotels, trip expenses, etc. the ticket cost for something decent seems outrageous, unless one of us gets lucky on the craps table.

Is anyone aware of any deals, promotions, or even contests to win tickets to this?
Would really like make this happen for him.

Thanks.

TLDR; Any promotions, deals, contests, etc... for UFC 162 tickets?

Its also one of the cheapest places to live on earth. With that said, I just wanted to spend a day to see if its feasible or just flat out not worth it. Many of the expenses in this country in order to live are cheap, and the laws are less restrictive for you to start a project.  Is there anything I can read to give me an example of what the costs would be, sans paperwork/lawyer/regulation/fees (doesnt matter there to the degree US considers)

My buddy and I are good with marketing, where we have done, tv ads, websites, mobile apps and much more that may help with launching such a project. Keep in mind this is not to compete with UFC or make a ton of money.

I must say, I've finally found a sport I really truly understand; no dumb rules, no silly teams, just two athletes competing in the ring with nothing but their fitness and training to decide the outcome. I'm really getting into it now! :)

Do you guys have any recommendations for which UFCs I should watch, as a new fan to the sport? 

I'm watching Shogun vs Jones right now, and I've seen UFC 102, UFC Fight Night 24, and one other UFC whose number I cannot recall at the moment.

Get_a_GOB	6	3	10	"I have to believe (I suppose I could look at PPV buys and confirm it) that these three guys are at least triple the moneymakers for the UFC of whoever's next on the list right now.  All three are dominant and out of (or close to it) interesting opponents.  I think that it hurts all three fighters' legacies, and the UFC as an organization if they never fight.

Granted, if they do, at least one will lose their eventual claim to P4P GOAT, but at least one will significantly strengthen it.  And if Anderson could beat both in catchweight bouts, he would be indisputable."	t5_2qsev	True
