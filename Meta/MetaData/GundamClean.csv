There's a couple of small simultaneous gundam issues happening.  There's a push for the Origin novel as well as a twitter movement called #bringbackgundam

I'm here for comments and to help put focus on what it is this is movement is about.  I'm not putting this into /gunpla/ because the products we bring into the u.s. are not just model kits.

I'm here because I'm confused about what gundam fans want.  It's like Occupy Wall Street right: a phrase and no cohesiveness.  And if I'm confused, that doesn't bode well for the companies we represent.

EDIT 1: Initial comments indicate #bringbackgundam is relatively unknown and isolated only to twitter to have gundam on toonami; Gundam the Origin pushes are actually a separate topic that's happening concurrently; by the terms ""gundam back in stores"" actually mean toysrus, walmart, target, though that's not likely to be possible"	t5_2sjr4	True

As some of you may have noticed over the past few months I've posted here and there about the upcoming release of *Gundam: The Origin* from Vertical. We're talking about a high quality, hard cover, full of extra features, release. Each volume gets one print, then it's done! As of right now [Volume 1](http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-ORIGIN-Activation/dp/193565487X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354580243&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gundam+origin) and [Volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-ORIGIN-Garma/dp/1935654888/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354580243&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=gundam+origin) are up for preorder on Amazon (check with your fav provider if you don't hang with Amazon). Volume 3 will probably show up in the next couple weeks.


Now, as far as I'm concerned, this is the biggest thing to happen regarding Gundam merchandise in North America in a long time, and will probably be the last big thing. As far as I can tell The Origin never got a full release here states so on its own it's going to be one hell of a collectable, never mind the added appeal for anime and Gundam fans alike.


Today Vertical tweeted about their current order for the first volume...

&gt; [@Vertical_Ed](https://twitter.com/Vertical_Ed/status/275690068440649728) Gundam ORIGIN news: If those estimates hold looks like the print run will be either 4000 to 4500. 


To which I responded...


&gt; [@Falldog](https://twitter.com/Falldog/status/275742191635267584) Is that good, bad, or somewhere in the middle of what you're expecting? 


And their response troubles me...


&gt; [@Vertical_Ed](https://twitter.com/Falldog/status/275742191635267584) it's fine. but as I noted to another person, it is disappointing to see that either the Gundam fandom is really small or that the Gundam fandom is all bark but no bite. and that Bandai and the rest were correct all along. and here is why... we usually launch a series with 6000 to 7000 copies, Chi's Sweet Home had 12,000. Gundam ORIGIN only 4000. 


*Ouch!* Some manga about a cat is currently out doing Gundam three-to-one! But the point about Bandai is a tough one to stomach. Is Bandai really right to have stepped out of the market in a lot of ways?


Am I wrong in thinking that we should all want one of these? With over subscribers to subreddit we can't possibly represent roughly 50% of the Gundam fanbase, can we? 


**Edit** - You guys have made some great points about the marketing and Amazon listing. I'm going to put some of this stuff together and send it with some other ideas to the Vertical guys.

1374961258.0	1j6k0w	I just made a playlist of every single Gundam series opening and ending songs	libo720	40	5	11	"So one day i was bored and decided to put my love for Gundam and music to good use, i decided to make a playlist of every single Gundam opening and ending songs that exist on Grooveshark.

I have included not just the TV series but also movie versions too such as the 0079 movies, Zeta: A New Translation, the Turn A movies, and etc. 

I have put every series' songs together in this order:

1. 0079: song 1-5
2. MS Igloo: song 6-10
3. 08th MS Team: song 11-14
4. 0080: song 15-16
5. 0083: song 17-21
6. Zeta: song 22-28
7. ZZ: song 29-32
8. Char's Counterattack: song 33
9. Gundam Unicorn: song 34-39
10. F91: song 40-41
11. Victory: song 42-45
12. G-Gundam: song 46-49
13. Gundam Wing: song 50-54
14. Gundam X: song 55-59
15. Turn A: song 61-64
16. Seed: song 65-73
17. Seed Destiny: song 74-84 (Missing one song)
18. Stargazer: song 85
19. Seed Astray: song 86
20. Gundam 00: song 87-100 (Includes movie and special edition)
21. Gundam Age: song 101-108 (Will add Memory of Eden once it come out)
22. Gundam Evolve: song 109-114
23. Gunpla Builders Beginning G: (Missing one song)

The songs missing are: 

1. [Result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElPO4t6ywaI) by Nami Tamaki, it is the ending song of Seed Destiny special edition episode one.
2. [My proud, my play!](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjMwODI1NzA0.html) by KAmiYU, it is the opening song of Gunpla Builder Beginning G.

These missing songs are all very good in my opinion, so i think you guys should check it out. It would be great help if anyone can find a link of them on Grooveshark or even upload it yourselves and send it to me so i can complete the list. 

I will be updating this playlist as new songs come out. 

**Here is the link to my playlist:** [Gundam playlist] (http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/Gundam+Collection/88855756) **enjoy!**

**(Update)** [AURORA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHo9NOXd6VQ) by Eir Aoi is now added to the playlist thanks to /u/Gent_Crayfish for generously taking his time and uploading it to Grooveshark. Will keep on updating this in the future. "	t5_2sjr4	True

I know what you're thinking 

""make our own Gundam series?! that's crazy we'd never be able to do that""

We can do it though, if 4 chan can make a visual novel game and 7 chan can make erotic comics then we can make a Gundam Series we're a big enough fans and big enough a community to know what clicks with other fans of the series and get things done efficiently and so I believe we can do this.

Now I'm an artist, [I love drawing robots](http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1295442/12) so I think ill be able to draw all your ideas starting off, you can jump in with your own sketches, that'd actually be helpful, but I just want to say; I'm not a writer, that's where you guys come in:

What I suggest we do is we either come up with characters or we come up with the story first, its your call I'm just the artist, then we either work our way up to story boarding the first Volume, now I'm not going to hog being the artist, everyone else is welcome to draw instead of me infact you'd be welcome to do it, this is a collaboration and anything you bring to the table will be appreciated immensely.

***

**LIST OF THINGS TO DO**

- Name ourselves

- Design and discuss characters and universe and Mobile Suits.

(Create series Zaku 2, Create Series GM, Create Series Char Aznoble arc type, own version of newtype? like x-rounder or innovade, create initial gundam, create half way series upgrade, End of series Mobile Armour that protagonist has to battle)


- Construct Story line and plot points around the attributes listed in previous task

- Write Script

- Do reference sketches and concept art 

- do Story boarding for first Volume 

- Finish Vol 1 release to Newgrounds and other places

- Begin Vol 2 repeat until series finish

If I've missed anything then it'll be added.

**TL;DR -  We're Making our own Gundam Series in our own Universe, Everyone can help, The series is open sourced, I'm an artist and so can you, List of shit we need to do, side notes.**

Three most important rules of all:

- NO MARY SUES / GARY STUS ALLOWED.

- Be Original and Creative in your Mobile Suit Designs.

- Stay away from Good VS. Evil scenarios, as that's not what Gundam is about whatsoever

As you know, a new [gundam shooter](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/14yevl/gundam_online_open_beta_starting_december_19th/) has been available to play for a month now. It's quite a fun game, but the hoops you have to jump through to play and the fact that it's not localized in English makes it fairly difficult to get hooked on. There was a little bit of discussion about playing together in the comments for the open beta, but that was almost a month ago.


I've been playing MSGO for a few weeks now and I have been searching for more English-speaking players to enjoy the game with. Platoon combat really helps the experience, but not being able to communicate is frustrating and stops any good maneuvers from happening. There is a pretty comprehensive [writeup](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3528612) on the sometimes-friendly Something Awful forums, and a small guild has formed. and we have a few folks running in a platoon most nights The non-Japanese community surrounding this game is nonexistent at the moment, so I'm hoping that some internet cultural boundaries can be crossed and a few lonely redditors might come and hang out with us.

**In short, find English speaking players on the Francessca server, Zeon side. Redditors are cordially invited to join GoonSquad**

If you have any questions about the game when you're logged in, send whispers to Nixon大統領

**A Mumble server has been set up for public access. Connect if you have any troubles getting the game set up or to find a group to play with once you're in-game. [mumble.msgo-english.info](mumble://mumble.msgo-english.info)**

In a world where various nations with long histories are not always on the friendliest terms with the West, I'm reminded of the Gundam's message that there are good people on both sides of a war who have valid reasons for fighting.    

The above things are the main reason I love Gundam. While I find its depiction of war extremely entertaining, I come back for the anti-war message. I've also had my politics influenced by it. My girlfriend argues most viewers don't care about the message of Gundam and that I'm an oddball. Anybody else like me or is Gundam just about the cool robot fights? "	t5_2sjr4	True

It should go without saying that it's all gonna be in Japanese, but it shouldn't be too difficult to navigate with a little trial and error.

[Here's](http://msgo.bandainamco-ol.jp/obt/) the page with all the details.

[Here's](https://id.banapassport.net/pc/entryTerms.php?sesB0=eec6c1a9e452bb10dfaa5ac426793b0f42016d67) the link to registration (click the button on the right, after that it's pretty self-explanatory)

[Here's](http://launcher.bandainamco-ol.jp/launcher/release/bno_starter.exe) the link to the patcher (note that you won't be able to launch the game until the 19th). It comes to a little less than 5GB.

Honestly it looks pretty mediocre to me, but it's free and should be fun for a few hours.

**UPDATE:**

If you've been trying to play, you've probably run into the same problems I did:

1 - the game doesn't launch from the launcher, and instead keeps ""updating"" by re-installing over and over.**

2 - the game is IP blocked, so if you do get it to launch, unless you live in Japan, you're stuck trying to log in over and over.

1348999218.0	10pfa8	So AGE was set up to fail [possible spoilers]	ArsAeria	29	4	33	"Okay, so this is a running discussion on /m/ that I've been participating in the past hour or so, but I wanted to share it with you guys here in case you don't visit there. 

There was an interview recently done interviewing Bandai about what happened with Gundam AGE. The following was translated by an anon:

-Hino is a new type of person that has never been involved with Gundam before

-When one wants to make enemies show up inside a colony, normally one has to work out how did they manage to infiltrate it, but Hino does not pay much attention to things like that. He visualizes it as a sequence of in-game events and thinks ""If enemies were to show up now it would put the cast in trouble and that would be fun."" 

-What he thinks is important is the timing of the enemies showing up: He has a tendency to think of a story as a sequence of in-game events.

**-The staff working on the show had to take Hino's ideas and add the missing logic to them.**

-They purposely left holes in the setting so that the fans would bite, and use those for getting ideas, but unfortunately this did not work out at all.

-At first they did not find the bad response to Age especially surprising, as this had happened with other Gundam series countless times before.

-However, about three months in (around December) they started to feel that something was wrong

-With other series, this is the point that the viewers start to say positive things, but this was not the case with Age. Even though there were positive things said, the negative things overwhelmed them drastically.

-Even so the staff tried their best to make the show interesting.

-They started to get confidence around the time HG AGE-2 went on sale. Sales also stabilized around this point.

-They found it interesting how many users played around modifying Age kits (more than usual).

-One of Age's unique qualities was being able to see a lot of modded kits while the show was airing.

-He has participated in other Gundam series and knew from the beginning that the Vegan designs would be unpopular with Gun-ota

-The Vegan designs were order-made

-He remembered how unpopular Zanscar's designs were and himself wondered if it would be a good idea to go with these

------

Behind the scenes, what happened was Bandai approached Akihrio Hino of Level-5 and wanted him to produce a huge selling hit. He didn't see the ability to do that with currently existing Gundam series, so he said he would need to create his own. Originally, AGE was designed to be a video game, but panned out into a series. Early on, when the series was met with critics (which was a HUGE shock to the development team), Hino's response to the fans was: **""*We didn't make a perfunctory approach to understand the concept of Gundam.* We are producing Gundam AGE in a different way from any other Gundam series. Our policy for the new gundam will be explained in the anime.""**

Basically...Hino didn't have any clue how to create a Gundam series in the first place, and admittedly left holes in the plot because he wanted fans to figure it out!

Then when none of the other writers or people on the team could figure out where the hell he was going with things...he figured, ""oh wow, the fans are making cool things! let's let them figure out the story!""

This is amazing to think about, because it all makes sense! This ship was doomed to sink from the beginning because it was only built 1/8 of the way...the builder never thought how to finish it! This clusterfuck was brought upon us because Bandai wanted to make money on their gunpla (which they really didn't) and because Hino could give 2 shits about Gundam fans.

Fuck Hino and fuck Level-5.

1355193405.0	14n4pr	Gundam: The Origin - FAQ	Falldog	31	6	15	"**What is Gundam: The Origin?**

Origin is an award winning manga adapation of the series by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko. Widly popular among Japanese Gundam fans it remains fairly true to the original series but updates the suits, battles, while adding more character depth and a lot more back story.

Bandai has announced that they'll be producing an animated adaptation of the series but haven't released any details. 

**What's the upcoming release from Vertical?**

Vertical's release of *Gundam: The Origin* is a limited hardcover release much like the Japanese hard cover collector's editions. Only a small amount of each volume will be printed and they will include extras like colour illustrations and translated essays and interviews. It's also worth noting that this is a brand new translation but I can't imagine much is different from when Viz made a run at releasing the whole series.

**How many are being made?**

That depends, how many have been pre-ordered? Really! As far as I can tell Vertical is planning their print run depending on how many pre-orders come in. If they see 5500 pre-orders they might print 6000. Not a clue on what sort of padding they add. The key point is that once they're gone, they're gone. 

**Will there be a digital edition??**

Vertical has commented on this several times and, when it comes down to it, the money and the market just isn't there. If I remember the details correctly only about 10% of the cost is print. Margins on these things are pretty small so at most they'd be able to cut that 10% off retail and folks aren't like to pay that for a physical edition. eBook retailers and larger publishers can afford to work on much smaller margins because they'll able to make it up with larger sales numbers.

**Is Vertical committed to releasing all of Origin?**

To quote Ed Chavez from Vertical, ""What I will say though is it is a long series and we do intend on releasing it all but right from the beginning we've made a point by saying that this is going to be a limited edition.""

**Where can I pre-order?**

Personally I went through Amazon but check with your preferred reseller.

Let's make our voices heard, let's tell Bandai that there are still a lot of US Gundam fans, and that we're worth their time and effort. 

I can guess what many of you are saying. ""It's not worth it, Funimation will take care of it,  We can just import the games. Dubs suck, Subs are enough."" Yeah? And how much money are you willing to piss away on Import costs and Model kits? Are you willing to sit idly by and hope that Funimation will come through? 

I'm not. We need to let Sunrise, Funimation, and Bandai know that there is still a market for Gundam out there. I ask that everyone on this board and also to anyone else out there, if you value Gundam, if you want games to start coming over here without having to pay import fees and pay out for shipping, I ask that you join me in making our Voices heard. Let's ensure that Gundam makes it over to the US, and gets the fair chance it deserves.

Just curious what the consensus is today.	episode1	26	6	79	About 12 years ago, I was browsing mahq.net's forums, and stumbled upon a question with what I thought was an extremely obvious answer.  Who would win in a fight:  Scirocco in The O or Char in Sazabi.  I immediately said Sazabi, and an epic, several day long, suprisingly stat-intensive debate ensued.  So, having completely forgotten the entire episode until a few days ago, I'm now wondering who r/gundam would pick and why?	t5_2sjr4	True

For me, it was when my brother got himself an Xbox 360 and the first Dynasty Warriors Gundam game. I played that pretty much non-stop when he gave the Xbox to me and I ended up researching what the series was. I found out it was an anime and manga series, found some episodes of Gundam SEED on youtube and started watching those. Been a fan since around 2007-2008 now.

1364175218.0	1ay477	Full Frontal's relationship to Char (spoilers for Char's Counterattack, Zeta Gundam, Gundam Unicorn and ZZ Gundam)	setsuna1f1seiei	23	3	33	"So, as far as I know the word of god has never specifically stated for a fact that Amuro and Char died.  I'm pretty sure the novelization of the movie said they were both KIA.  However, as the movie did not contain Hi-Nu or Nightingale, I do not believe the novelization could be considered canon.  Reading the information about Full Frontal, I started to wonder a few things.  Gundam Wikia says that he is a clone of Char and that his memories were implanted from the psychoframe of the Sazabi that was drifting through space.  But, I see a few inconsistencies here.  First off, when Amuro beat Char at the end of CCA he disabled Sazabi.  Char then ejected the cockpit, and I think it's logical to assume that an MS designed to be able to eject it's cockpit would have all the important information in that cockpit.  Mainly, the important components of the Psychoframe.  Even if we say that the memories used for Full Frontal were in the mobile suit itself, at that time Axis was in the Earth's gravity well.  Axis itself was pushed away due to the Axis Shock, but can we also assume that Sazabi was pushed away as well?

Even if we assume that Sazabi was indeed recovered by Neo Zeon, I think there are still enough inconsistencies to doubt Full Frontal's identity.  For example, even if he is a clone of Char, that only means he and Char are exactly the same on the genetic level.  If you go back and look at any scene in the Unicorn OVA's where Full Frontal takes his mask off, he has the scar that Char received during his sword fight with Amuro.  Scars are not embedded in your genetic code, and therefore would not be present on Char's clone.  The description on Gundam Wikia says that he possesses the ""residual thoughts of Char which were distorted in despair because humanity did not change after witnessing the miracle that occurred during 'Axis Shock.""  So, Unicorn Gundam takes place in UC 0096.  This is only three years after CCA.  The date for Char's death in CCA is listed as March 12th, 0093.  The date of his ""death"" combined with the next inconsistency is what made me consider all of this in the first place.  

So, according to Gundam Wikia, ""In U.C. 0094, the MSN-06S Sinanju Stein was stolen from Anaheim Eletronics by Neo-Zeon during a transfer from Granada to Von Braun. The Earth Federation forces composed of two Clop-class light cruisers that were sent to recover it were completely wiped out by the pilot of the Sinanju, Full Frontal, the man they call the Second Coming of Char Aznable, the Red Comet.""
Now, since Char ""died"" on March 12th UC 0093 I feel as though it is HIGHLY unlikely that roughly a year/year and a half later Neo Zeon has already: Recovered Sazabi, figured out that it contained Char's memories, cloned Char, figured out how to implant memories contained in the psychoframe into Char's clone, discovered that Anaheim was transporting a suit based on the one custom made for Char, and then to top it all off, have the Char clone himself involved in stealing the suit.

It is highly unlikely that the technology to create a highly stable cyber-newtype clone existed at the point of CCA.  If we look at all the cyber-newtypes in the universal century, we see that they are at best mentally unstable and are prone to odd breakdowns/mental overloads.  For example: Four Murasame, Rosamia Badam, Puru Two and Marida Cruz.  Taking this further, the only characters to be both clones AND cyber newtypes (the Puru series) have been shown to be unstable.  Going through the entire Unicorn OVA series, Full Frontal never exhibits any of the traits seen in the cyber newtypes/cloned cyber newtypes.  

Let's take a look at Char's history for a second.  Char was born Casval Rem Deikun, then had his name changed to Edward Mass, then assumed Char Aznable's identity, then assumed the identity of Quattro Bajeena, then went back to being Char.  Throughout most of his life, he had to conceal his true identity.  As Char Aznable, he lied and wore a mask to prevent people from realizing he was really Casval Rem Deikun.  As Quattro Bajeena he wore sunglasses to hide his identity.  When he finally used his ""real"" identity of Char again it was at Dakar when he made his speech to the world.  Then, at the end of Zeta when he was assumed dead until you saw the empty Hyaku Shiki cockpit float by he waited until CCA to use his Char identity to ultimately force humanity's evolution.  However, his method of dropping Axis on the earth may have made him wanted as a war criminal.  Thus, if we assume that he actually survived Char's Counterattack, it makes sense that he wouldn't want to necessarily be Char again.  IF Full Frontal is actually just Char and not just a clone of him, it's a pretty brilliant plan.  By taking the identity of a clone of Char, he gets to be himself without actually having to be himself.  As a clone of Char Aznable, he's not responsible for Char Aznable's actions.  

It is my belief that Full Frontal is actually Char Aznable.  He survived the conclusion of Char's Counterattack, and tried to take a less active role in the world.  However even after Amuro's death and the Axis Shock, the world showed no signs of changing.  He falls to despair and instead of coming back as Char Aznable once again, he assumes the identity of Full Frontal.  In UC0096 his hair is incredibly long, as long as about three years worth of growth.  He forsakes the earthnoids, seeing them as undeserving of being saved after their stubborn refusal to change after the Axis Shock.  He steals the Sinanju Stein and impersonates himself to use Laplace's Box as a means to ensure the future for the spacenoids.  

I don't know how well fan theories are taken on this subreddit but my desire is to have a discussion and try to really figure out if Full Frontal is really Char or just his clone.  I believe that based on all the evidence, Full Frontal is indeed Casval Rem Deikun impersonating himself to provide the spacenoids with a Char while at the same time avoiding the fallout from the events of CCA.  I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts!"	t5_2sjr4	True

We need people to play Veterans of this war, some Zeon, some Federation. We could even use people willing to act out scenes, or simply stare longingly off into the middle distance while a flag billows mournfully behind them What's that? No traditional acting instruction? Your acting even makes trolls embarrased to make fun of you? No problem.  

We need people with model kits and Suede jackets to tell us about the mobile suits and thier contributions during the war. And not just models, we need flags, guns and props, anything that looks like it may have come from the war. Spout facts and figures while trying desperatly to make it look interesting, just like a real historian!

What's that, no acting talent, no model kits and other cool stuff and a face that scares young children? Still not a problem. We'll need graphic designers and CGI experts, people who can throw together a wirefram model of a colony and show it plunging to Earth, or showing how the machinery in mobile suit joints work, or even something as simple as the opening credits!

Hold on, you say you have no acting talent, no cool stuff and you're unable to interact electronically with anything more complicated than a speak and spell? Still not a problem. We need camera operators, organizers, artists, narrators, even Gundam lore consultants, all so that we can make this documentary and make it great! 

But most of all, we need people who are passionate about the Gundam Universe, people who want to showcase thier talent, people who want to make something cool for nerds to nitpick to pieces. 

Come on R/Gundam, lets go Full Frontal on this project, let's make a Newtype of documentary, something that will DOMinate, a Revil-ation, a product that will make jaws around the world colony-drop, (okay I'm done now) something that will make every Gundam fan around the world raise thier fists and cry ""SEIG ZEON!"" Who's with me!

Edit: I will serve as project coordinator and try to come up with some kind of script, a list of topics and what we need. I cannont emphasise enough, any interest at all, any contribution, be it just your voice, or your relics or your time is incredibly valuable. I especially need people who know what kind of material and saftware we will need to compile all of this. The best thing we can do now, if we really care about this project, is to get as many people onboard as possible, tell your friends, tell other fans, bring them here and have them join us! Keep the enthusiasm up, Take your passion and turn it into results! Our project thirsts for the strength of its people!. If Halo fans can do it, so can we!!! 

Edit #2: Alright everybody, so far the enthusiasm is great, lets keep it that way! If we are going to do this project right, we are going to need to work together cooperatively over a long period of time. To be realistic, this project is a long term endeavor, it will take a lot of work, but this effort is supposed to bring together the best of all of our talent, all of our passion! Now, so that we can organize this more efficiently, i am going to start compiling lists, of things we have and things we need. I also may set up a organization page outside of Reddit, as sharing personal contact information here is kind of like going up agianst a Zaku in a Ball, you can do it, but the results will probably be decidedly ugly. Again, I can't stress enough that this is not a weekend project, this will take some time and require a great deal of hard work. But, the end result will be worth it! 

I hereby announce our end date, when our efforts shall all come together.  On this date one year from now, October 26th of 2013, the UC 0079 project will be launched! (we still need a real name for this project!)

Edit 3: Alright, aside from some technical problems, this project is still on track. I will be setting up a facebook account in order to porcess and handle this project. Once it is created i will message all of you. I am also awaiting a new computer, as my old one has suffered a mental collapse, and it has made it a little harder to communicate.

Please, do not give up on this project. Keep the enthusiasm up! We can do this! Please stand by for further updates.

Edit 4: Okay, so, A new Facebook page for this project has been formed. it is Oneyear War
(oneyear is all one word, it was intentional, trust me). Head on over there for updates and schedules as soon as they come out and lets get this thing off the ground!

There is also a new email for this project, it is Oneyeardoc@hotmail.com. "	t5_2sjr4	True

Zeon Zum Deikun was the one to come up with the theory of Newtypes being the next step in evolution. He also believed that earth was sacred and that mankind should leave it to live in space (and further develop into Newtypes).


Then he declared independence from the Earth Sphere and of course shit started to go down. The Federation deemed it a threat to their control and (according to Wiki... I couldn't find any other sources) halted resources to Side 3 where Zeon was leader. 


Finally, Zeon is (possibly) assassinated by Degwin Zabi who warps Zeon's ideals and makes it into a principality and declares war on the Federation. The colony is dropped and the infamous One Year War starts.


Now I know that Zeon does some horrible thing (One Week Battle, etc.) but their deep-rooted ideals really come from Zeon's philosophy of Ere-ism (Earth sacred, we should leave it). This is where the spacenoid's arrogance comes from, how the Federation's souls are ""trapped by gravity's pull."" 


According to wiki, Gundam: The Origin supposedly paints Zeon Zum Deikun as borderline fanatic with his ideals (it's still not canon) but even if he wasn't a fanatic, Degwin certainly warped those ideas.

1373913448.0	1ictti	Newer Gundam Series heading towards the “Kiddy” Direction	krizalid70559	27	10	108	"Hey /r/gundam,

I was on another forum (uwants) and found an interesting thread about the direction newer Gundam series are heading.

**The point of topic is the newer Gundam series are heading towards the kiddy direction; as the original Gundam series (UC) is more about war, whereas the newer series, particularly G, SEED, AGE, are more about heroism, which is more for kids.**

It seems like in Asia, no one is too happy about Gundam/Gunpla fighter the anime.  While they all understand that it will just be a side series, they think that it is immature.

Some people even go as far as saying: “Seed has been controversial for 10 years.  00 was the beginning of a downhill, and AGE was absolutely garbage”.  Some also mentioned that Bandai used most of their promoting resources to push Kakumeiki Valverave, and merely use Gundam shows as a Gunpla commercial.  Many people in Asia is saying Gundam is slowly dying, and Bandai is slowly letting it wither.

Ultimately it boils down to Bandai is only going for the money at this point, with very little intention to actually tend to fans.

**Personal opinion:**  I am a fan of the Seed series, I thought 00 was okay too.  I recently started watching UC stuff again, which in the beginning I thought I would be put off by the old graphics but the plot was interesting enough to keep me going.  I’ve got to say, after watching the UC I still don’t think Seed and 00 are that bad (Destiny is another story).  Age however, does strike me as immature, and the art style/mech design put me out of interest.  

With Bandai coming up with the new Gunpla Fighter show, I am happy and upset at the same time; I am happy to see all my favorite Gundams and MS to be in the same show battling, but I am upset because I don’t like the kiddy direction that Gundam is heading towards.

Couple that with the fact that there are different lists all over the internet as to what you should watch first and when and it's very confusing. 

Perhaps put a link on the sidebar that leads to a list of 

a) the timeline of the Gundam universe, complete with alternate timelines like Wing. 

and/or

b) a list of the best order you should watch gundam in

There are people posting the question ""what should I watch"" every week and I think this would be a great resource to those people and help make the idea of watching the entire gundam universe not quite as daunting.

**My Thoughts (NOTE: Only on this episode)**  
First off, this portion will only be about this episode, I will be writing my full review of the series some other time.  
Wished it was better, but it still felt completed to me. Wish Zera wasn't just a shoe-horned character with no actual character. Shido did very little, really just showed up so the writers could tie off a loose end. Ezlecant passing away with trust in Kio was acceptable.  
Now onto Flit. I stand by my belief that Flit was always the main character, even outside of his generation. The whole scene of Kio trying to stop Flit was pretty nice, and I loved the Ghosts scene. Flit as a character is going to be a favorite of mine for now on.  
All in all, not the best finale, but acceptable. Feels good to watch a gundam air week to week and I can't believe its over. Gonna miss doing this weekly posts!"	t5_2sjr4	True

But the suggestion was to grab the video from YouTube. ""Oh the compression,"" I thought to myself. So I took my Blu-Rays and extracted each of the menu screens myself and converted them to WMV for you. I've done both 720p and 1080p conversion for you if you have a smaller screen size or don't have a powerful enough GPU to do a 1080 screensaver.

I've also included the original 1080p MKVs if you wanted them in its full glory. 

Download Link: https://mega.co.nz/#F!ZYtTFQBB!VNHqyCVVjx57fW1Hei9V1w


Details:
* 720 WMV file sizes range from 11MB to 49MB.

* 1080 WMV file sizes range from 36MB to 113MB.

* 1080 MKV file sizes range from 164MB to 800MB.

* The files are approx 2-4 minutes long and feature a different song for each menu screen.

* The interfaces are all different as well. They go in this order:
1. Unicorn
2. Shinanju
3. Kshatriya
4. Shamblo
5. Banshee
6. Rozen Zulu

Perhaps we can get a good list going of worthwhile series that Gundam fans would enjoy!~ 

I'll start with my own: 

* Evangelion
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Martian Successor Nadesico
* Super Dimension Fortress Macross
* Votoms (just started this, and it's awesome so far!)
* **Ideon** (I highly, highly recommend this to those who enjoyed the darker Tomino series like Zeta and Victory. This is grimdark Tomino at his best!)
* Eureka SeveN

By that I mean, once a week we would hop on a livestream and watch maybe 2 hours of gundam and just hang out in chat.  
I've been messing around with livestreaming settings and I think I've got it to a pretty good quality and minimal lag.

So I made a list, and am asking you to write a small (less than 10 word) review next to the series or movies you have seen. Here we go!

* Mobile Suit Gundam - Only saw the movies.
* Zeta - My favorite - awesome.
* ZZ - Slow start, but got serious and good.
* Char's Counterattack - Fun, but who attacked Char first?
* 0080 - Interesting, liked it more when I first saw it.
* 0083 - Fantastic, great animation and good story. And Cima.
* F91 - Might have worked better as a series?
* Victory - I liked it, but Tomino has serious mommy issues.
* G Gundam - We need more like this.
* Wing - Fun for nostalgia, bad upon re-watching.
* Endless Waltz - Good animation, terrible movie.
* 08th MS Team - Really good, MS in Vietnam.
* Gundam X - Have not seen...
* Turn A - Much better than expected. Epic at the end.
* SEED - Ok. Kind of slow. Could be better.
* SEED Destiny - Nope.
* SEED Stargazer - What SEED should be like.
* 00 - Flashy, fun. Kind of like Wing.
* 00 Movie - On the fence about it.
* Unicorn - So good. So pretty.
* AGE - Just started watching it. Meh

I think that's it. So - what are your thoughts? Did I miss any?

1344997587.0	y8mxi	Who else thinks the Cosmic Era Timeline needs to be Rebooted?	WackyModder84	31	16	80	"Alright /r/Gundam, I wanna ask you guys something:

As Gundam fans, which Mainstream Gundam Anime would you say get's picked on the most out of all the ones out there? 

Mainstream Gundam animes consist of: Gundam Wing, G Gundam, Gundam SEED, and Gundam 00. The answer to my question above should be obvious, of course. Out of all the Mainstream Gundam Animes out there, the Cosmic Era is without a doubt the most Controversial Era in all of Gundam.

It's honestly something that has developed quite a negative reputation in the Gundam Community based on all the major problems it suffers from; one of these major problems being Gundam SEED Destiny in it's entirety. When I saw the 1st Gundam SEED, I did enjoy it, but at the same time, I did notice quite a lot of flaws with it that I wished were patched up. Granted, Gundam SEED HD Remastering IS an improvement, the problem is: it didn't fully solve the problem.

The Cosmic Era Timeline was meant to be a re-imagining of the Universal Century Timeline. In some ways, it did just that. But in most other ways, it fell flat on it's face. And as a result, the Cosmic Era has become nothing but ""The Joke Timeline"" in the Gundam Community for haters, UC Fanboys, Wing Fanboys, etc... to pick on all the time.

Being someone who has been a fan of gundam for 16 years straight now, I'm honestly getting sick and tired of having to constantly explain everything that is wrong about the Cosmic Era Timeline to SEED Fanboys who deny the plainly obvious flaws, but at the same time: I really wish Gundam SEED was **more** than what it currently is with all of it's major problems:

- Kira and Lacus being complete Mary-Sue Characters without question.

- Shinn Asuka being dropped as the main character in replace of Kira at the last minute in SEED Destiny, and thus having his entire character being pointlessly built up from the beginning and then having all of his character development completely thrown out the window.

- Kira being always right and never wrong about everything he says and does.

- Kira inexplicably cheating death 3 times in a row with no explanation as to how he survived each time. 

- Mu La Flaga inexplicably surviving a Lohengrin to the face at the end of SEED when it clearly showed his shattered helmet floating through space. 

- The new cast in Gundam SEED Destiny  being overshadowed by the Old Cast because apparently the new cast wasn't as well recieved by the fans.
 
- The Constant use of Flashbacks and Re-Cap Episodes. 

- Gundam SEED having as much Recycled Stock Footage as Gundam Wing, and Gundam SEED Destiny have more recycled stock footage than Scooby Doo. 

- Massive unoriginality in the designs of Six Major Gundams in SEED Destiny, and in some cases: Mobile Suit Design that made absolutely no sense.

- Vaguely and/or Unexplained Technology all over the place.

- Athrun having the Same Exact Character Development Arc in SEED Destiny that he did in SEED.

- Kira having absolutely NO character development at all in Destiny.

- Pointless wasted characters such as Miguel Ayman and Heine Westenfluss.

- SEED Destiny's plot being in many ways just a mirror of Gundam SEED's plot all over agian.


This is all sounding like bad fanfiction. After enjoying Gundam SEED my first time around, I had EXTREMELY high hopes for SEED Destiny. I was hoping that they were going to improve on some of the problems that SEED had, but unfortunately it was quite the opposite. It really disappointed me to see SEED turn into nothing but a joke for haters to gripe on. Granted, I will say right now: I am a fan of what Gundam SEED currently is; except for Destiny. Gundam SEED right now, I still think is not TOO bad, and SEED Stargazer was actually Awesome! The only problem with it was that it was too short. I also found the SEED Astray mangas to be Very Enjoyable and with Much Better Story, and I do like how they at least **tried** to fix some of the plotholes in SEED. But unfortunately, they unintentionally made it worse by contradicting the events in the anime with the explanations they've provided for some of them.


My point here being: I know that Gundam SEED could have been **a lot** better than this. Mitsuo Fukuda; I understand he's a huge fan of Tomino, but it seems to me that when he took on the job of doing Gundam SEED, there was still a lot about Gundam that he really didn't fully understand. Gundam is not about Pretty-Boys in Mobile Suits blowing shit up with Superlasers and Beam Spam. It's a war story. It's not about Good Vs. Evil, but rather a War of Different Ideologies.


I think after reading all that, we can all pretty much agree here: What Gundam SEED really needs is NOT an HD Remastering. But rather, a Complete Series Reboot from scratch, and this time NOT done by Mitsuo Fukuda and his Wife. I believe that Gundam SEED can most definitely be fixed and it can really turn out to be a great re-imagining of the Universal Century Timeline if the proper time and effort was put into it.


I don't blame Gundam SEED Destiny for sucking. It wasn't it's fault. It was all due to Bad Directing and Behind-The-Scenes Politics (including Fukuda's Wife coming down with Brain Cancer during SEED Destiny's Development). Which further reinforces that SEED really needs a Reboot due to all the problems that happened during it's development. If SEED was able to get developed with an actual plan in mind, it would be able to turn out FANTASTIC.


So /r/Gundam, I want your opinion on this.

Now as you all know, his sister appears, executes him for what he did to their father and takes command of all remaining forces.

After she take control, things start to look incredibly bleak for zeon; they begin to lose ground on all fronts. She sounds the retreat and the rest is history.

My favorite part of the series is the fact that they actually kill off some of my favorite characters - Lahla, anyone?

Also, another great moment was Char blowing off that girl's head in the end. Loved it.

The point of this is to give logical justifications for what Gundam is the strongest in the franchise, and across universes. Gundams are not hampered by the rules of other universes, unless it is a feature specific to the Gundam it is fighting against. (For example don't say that RX-178 would beat Dynames because Minovsky particles in the UC universe would keep him from being able to see sniping targets, but it would be valid to say that Throne Drei could jam the radar systems.) Also, it might be useful to assume that anti-Newtype weaponry would respond to Innovators and AW-Newtypes as well.

I quickly burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter as Tifa timidly claimed that she ""doesn't want to hurt anyone"" as she fired her Atomic Fucking Bazooka and incinerated Char in his Zaku II. Then she proceeded to say ""No!"" in fear when another Zaku II attacked her, and ""Don't!"" as she desperately retaliated by firing another shot of Atomic Bazooka and caused a molecular disintegration of the attacker. She then went into hyper mode triggered when sufficient number of enemies are defeated(has the effect of causing Super Criticals which do over 2 times damage.) She then said ""I don't want to repeat past mistakes,"" and fired the nuclear bazooka on the bridge of the Musai, destroying it with one hit. Over the whole sequence, I was cackling like a mad man.

As many of you know I've been a big proponent of Vertical's release of [Gundam: The Origin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/14n4pr/gundam_the_origin_faq/). While the first two volumes have been fantastic the blurbs on the back cover have given me a nice chuckle. Volume I's was ridiculously over dramatic while Volume II's run-on with *random emphasis* was just silly. 


Thus drives the premise of this contest. **The goal? Create an original blurb, describing the series, which would fit perfectly on the back of the cover of an upcoming Origin release.**


While part of me thinks it would be great to see silly entries it would be fantastic if a well worded blurb could get consideration for print from Vertical. A bit of a pipe dream? Perhaps, but who says we can't try?! Create something funny, something serious, something appropriate. Whatever you like because this contest is to be judged by your peers on r/Gundam! The most beloved entry will win a copy of **The Origin volume 3**! 


The rules are simple...

* Each blurb must be no more than 80 words in length
* Each user can enter up to three times
* Winner must be able to receive a shipment from Amazon US
* I may make up more rules between now and the start of the contest
* Well reasoned objections to the rules or means of contest will be considered
* Entries must be posted below by July 17th, 2013. The contest may remain alive afterward as an additional voting period but entries posted after the 17th will not qualify for a prize


To submit your entry...

* Simply add your comment below as a new comment to the story (in other words don't reply to someone elses comment or blurb with your own entry)


To vote on your favorites...

* Up-vote the blurbs you like!
* Votes will be hidden until the winner is announced
* Be sure to check back often for new entries


Questions? Comments? Concerns? Please message me directly. Best of luck!

**It's The End!**

I'm finally calling it as a two way tie! Congratulations to Finishingtothesky and i2WalkedOnJesus for winning a copy of the upcoming Gundam: The Origin volume 3!"	t5_2sjr4	True

Proposed names so far

* Mobile Suit Gundam: Bellum Domesticum

* Mobile Suit Omega Gundam (Not likely since this is not UC, and we want to make sure to distinguish this series from Zeta/ZZ.

* Mobile Suit Gundam: A House Divided ( I really like it, also simpler for people who would be too lazy to translate latin. Perhaps A System Divided, as it is for the most part the solar system we are talking about?)

* Mobile Suit Gundam: Divided House/System ( If we wanted to go simpler.)


**Edit: I will give it another hour, and if noone else suggests anything I will make /r/Bellum, or should it be/r/Bellumdomesticum?**

**Edit 2: Looking like Divided House is the best option atm, still a bit of time if anyone wants to object.**

When I was a kid the only anime I watched really was Gundam Wing on Toonami and I thought it was the shit. Skip forward many years and it was a boring night and I went for a look to re-watch the only anime I ever watched. Turns out it wasn't as good as I remembered it lol, I used to think Hero was cool as fuck, but now being a sensible adult he's kind of weird (Reliena is creepy as fuck, holy shit). But I now have some free time...

So I then looked into other animes (I really do wanna give anime a try before casting it off as ""kid"" material). I really liked Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, mainly due to the fact it was less ""japanesee"" with the japanese words and art, likeable characters ect... But I still wanted to give Gundam shit a chance because big robots fighting is fucking cool.

Anyway I looked into the later productions on the wikipedia page and saw Gundam Unicorn was in production still at first I said ""That name is pretty gay, I'll give the show a shot though."" 

God damn that shit was good, I watched the English dubbed ones 1-5. It's very Americanized (prolly why I like it), and the music - holy fuck the music is very professional/A list movie stuff. The animation and art direction is beautiful as well, when I rewatched Gundam Wing they re-used the sand mobile suit taking cover/shooting from behind the rocks like 800 times and it made me cringe. But there is no re-use of animation in these. Plus the characters are likeable. (I figured after watching Gundam Wing/FMA:B that it's big for the japanese to push the whole ""Anti-war"" talk to annoying levels, so I'm not really bothered by it) So my questions are...


Are there any other Gundam shows that are like Gundam Unicorn (Americanized kinda with no animation re-use)

And...

How many episodes are there going to be of Gundam Unicorn?

Thanks any help would be awesome.

Granted that most of these were stolen or commandeered after previous wars, it would still take billions of dollars just to maintain them every year, not to mention upgrading and supplying most of these would cost hundreds of billions more.

I could understand Zeon during the time when open warfare was declared and they actually had an economy (estimated at 30x smaller than its enemy's) that at least had very high industrial output. 

Based on what I saw from Unicorn Episode 3, it really amazes me how they maintain such a large force without actually holding any recognized territory.

Where do you think their funding comes from now? I don't read the mangas / novels, so is there any information that I might not have come across yet?

1366700807.0	1cx82g	Why is Zeta Gundam considered the best Gundam series?	xarmyz	35	22	54	"I going to commit utter fandom heresy here by admitting that I HATED Zeta Gundam and having never really understood why a vast majority of the Gundam franchise considers it the zenith of the franchise. 

The reasons I dislike it are this:

 There are a lots of promising story threads that are never properly explored, or given all the room they deserved. The story often feels like it's stalled or has been running in circles, with a rushed conclusion that to me feels like only a pale shadow of what it could have been. 

A key issue I have here is that the Titans don't really have a plan. The original series could get away with a mostly reactive Zeon because it was clear the conflict was at a stalemate, and the White Base was the perturbative element ; this doesn't fly in a story where the villains are introduced as much more proactive, what with just now trying to take over the world.

Yes, I realize AEUG are supposed to be proactive too, what with being an underground rebellion ; but whatever plans they initially had early in the series don't survive for very long, and they're stuck in reactive survival mode from Jaburo onwards. This could be fine if we got a sense of the Titans progressively increasing their pressure (similar to how the White Base was growing more and more desperate in the first half of the original series), but that's clearly not what happened until the very end.

A similar issue was the Federation being such a non-entity ; you'd think it'd have a key political role, if only for the Titans to supplant them ; in practice its role is close to nothing. It's particularly jarring when the series tries to sell us on Char's Dakar speech being Very Important, despite having no consequences whatsoever. (I chuckled when Haman off-handedly mentionned that the Federation Assembly suddenly stopped supporting the Titans offscreen. Of course it did.)

There really was a lot of potential for an interesting political conflict, full of imprevisible backstabbing ; we only get about 10 episodes of that at the end, if that. Way too much room was devoted to pointless and aimless subplots, such as having two separate arcs where Four dies at the end. This could maybe have worked if the narrative had spun this as a component of the Titans' plan, but like Rosamia's later arc it just looks like an unexpected side-effect of the Titans experimenting with augmented humans for the hell of it. Again, it comes back to the Titans not really having a plan besides ""doing random nasty stuff"". They have no wider strategy that I can discern, and the story suffers hugely from it.

This isn't the only big problem I have with Zeta ; there is something to be said about its unlikeable and unscruptable protagonists. Not only do I despise Camille, but I could never really understand what made him tick (which isn't made easier by his attitude often changing completely from episode to episode). Same with Fa, whose behaviour rarely made sense to me ; and Emma had her unfathomable moments too. I at least understood a bit what was going on with Reccoa, however repellent I found it. I don't think really I need to go into the sheer annoyance that is Katz. And I've never really liked Char in any of his incarnations (I found him to be a smug sociopathic jackass in MSG, An irresponsible coward in Zeta and a petty, hypocritical mass-murderer in CCA) Thank gods for Bright!

Then there are the Titans who are the most boring antagonists in a Gundam series ever. We are never giving any good argument from their side as to why their cause may be right beyond ""We're the Titans. Do what we say or we'll kill you."" Jamitov is barely in the series and has zero personality. Bask and Yazan are one-dimensional sadist bullies who are evil just for the sake of it. Scirocco just sits around in the background, doing nothing really important until the last five episodes and is never giving a real motive beyond ""I want to rule the world because I'm a Newtype Genius!"" Sarah is obnoxious Scirocco fangirl and more proof of Tomino's misogyny at the work. And then there Jerid who is the biggest disappointment of all, I actually like him more than Kamille in the beginning and watching his character development into a respectable enemy rival was the best thing in Zeta. That is until after Mouar's death, where he pretty much disappears from the series only to pop up to kill Four and screw up at Dakar, vanish, pop again to kill Apolly then vanish again then die anti-climatically in the penultimate episode when he deserved to be the final boss for Kamille, not Scirocco who had zero history with him. Haman was indeed awesome but didn't have enough real screen-time as it was saved for ZZ.

And I don't even want to go into that whole ""Souls weighted down by gravity"" bullshit that Tomino thinks is deep philosophy and won't stop beating us over the head with.    

I know there's the mind set of ""It's dark, tragic and cynical so therefore it's mature and deep and automatically better!"" Is that part of what's going on here? Because it didn't work at all for me. I'd even take the disappointing likes of Seed Destiny and Age over it. So why do so many of you think it's a masterpiece? Because it honestly escapes me.

Something that I noticed when Bright was talking to Banagher is that Bright seems aware that gundams choose their pilots. And in the UC for the most part this seems true. 

Amuro, Banagher, Uso, Kamillie, and Judau are all pilots of gundams that just happened to get into the cockpit by some crazy chain of events. A few of the other pilots were just test pilots that grew affinity for their suits.

Do you think it is possible that Zeon or the EFSF has any knowledge of this method of discovering pilots? It has never really been talked about but Bright seems to be Very knowledgeable of the minds of gundam pilots and he seems to understand this seemingly divine placement exists. Would it be possible that some hidden group of people are controlling the strings behind the pilots finding the gundams?

A followup question is, how does the EFSF function if teenagers have the ability to steal highly classified and experimental weapons when a battle breaks out.

-All three Gundams are finally in the same battle  
-Federation forces cant break through, Flit says to just use the Plasma Diver missile and destroy the base  
-Diva uses the Photon Blaster to open up a hole to infiltrate  
-Girard suffers from an x-rounder feedback and goes out of control  
-Girard now has the ability to control x-rounder tech from other mobile suits (Funnels/Bits)  
-Girard's power is blocking everyone else's x-rounder power

-Lt. Abis warns the Vagan about the Plasma Diver  
-Simmons is shot and supposedly killed by a Vagan he had shot while trying to escape  
-Flit shoots and kills Girard  
-Vagan surrender, Officers become prisoners but grunts are free  
-Simmons is revealed to only be wounded, but Fram kills him  
-The Vagan Base/Colony Second Moon has arrived at Earth  
  
**My Thoughts**  
Sigh, AGE is really ruining itself. Girard just became another Shanalua, a tragic character that just gets killed off too early for anyone to really care about; thereby wasting all the time spent trying to introduce her. Feels like I'm rewatching Victory Gundam and the Shrike team. The battle itself had so much potential. An x-rounder going out of control and beating every other x-rounder is PERFECT setup for the plot device that is Super Pilot Asemu. The fact he wasnt affected could have allowed more spotlight to have been placed on him...  
Looking ahead, with the idea that both sides are growing very considerate of their troops, I can easily imagine the Vagan and Federation joining sides to face their common enemy Ezlecant.  
Seriously, AGE needs to stop wasting their own potential....  
  
**Preview**[""Diverging Paths""  
Narrator describes that as the battle approaches, people have different opinions. We see a shot of Ezlecant still manipulating the Vagans. Zeheart looks like hes arguing with someone. The Asunos are arguing with each other. A shot of Gundam Legilis and it is implied Zeheart is now the pilot.  
Best guess, Kio tries to convince Flit to spare the Vagan and most likely fails. Zeheart is either given the Legilis by Ezlecant to stay with him, or Zeheart finally realizes Ezlecant's true goal and steals the Legilis.](/spoiler)

-Federation reinforcements interrupt, only to be attacked by Girard Spriggan in a Fed/Vagan hybrid suit  
  
**My Thoughts**  
Episode was a bit too flashback heavy. However, it great to finally have it confirmed who Fram is and that she trusts Zeheart now. Asemu telling Flit to fuck off was great. Girard Spriggan finally making an appearance after her name drop back in Ep.33 was nice.  
Btw, is it just me or is Kio actually pulling off Kira better than Kira. Watching his c-funnels decapitate suits is MUCH better than watching kira auto-target derp a whole battlefield. Also, C-FUNNEL BARRIER HOLY FUCK &lt;3  
Hopefully we will see everyone's different ideals clash soon. Can't wait to see who changes and who stays the same and what the final ""teams"" become  
  
**Preview** [""Girard Spriggan""  
Girard Spriggan is desribed as being a ""traitor burdened with sorrow"" as we see shots of her talking to a Federation officer and a shot of the Federation commander who let Luna fall. So, I'm guessing she wanted to do something, the federation refused to let her, so she joined the defectors and the Vagan. This better be a decent reason...

The general consensus is that Banagher is a natural Newtype. I feel otherwise. I'm gonna paste my two cents from the Gundam wiki discussion thread. Since I'm the only one that's posted on it in almost a year, I figured I'd get much better feedback over here.


&gt;Well there are significant hints that Banagher's a Cyber Newtype. In their conversation in the Nahel Argama's medical ward, Marida hints that she and he are similar. It's also stated that the NT-D would be too much strain on even a Newtype pilot, and that it would take a Cyber Newtype to handle it. Then we have the scene in (I think) episode 2, where a young Banagher is playing the piano with all sorts of gear hooked up to him. While it doesn't explicitly say much, they seem to me to imply a lot.


Also, there seemed to be some confusion as to how the Unicorn Gundam itself worked. Someone said that the Unicorn was designed to allow a normal pilot to operate on the level of a newtype. Here's my brief summary, please tell me if you think I'm off-base

&gt;The Unicorn is not designed to give newtype abilities to non-Newtypes *(the F91's bio-computer DID do that, however, it's even more effective with someone who's already a Newtype.)*. The whole point of the NT-D is to use a Newtype pilot as a processor/sensor package for the machine itself. It causes a psychommu backflow that prevents the pilot from sending their own commands to the system, while simultaneously getting all the information it needs straight from the pilot's brain. This allows the Unicorn's AI (all MS have rudimentary AI installed) to carry out attacks on the enemy with the precognition abilities of a newtype."	t5_2sjr4	True

First I would prefer to see it based in the original UC cannon sometime later after V Gundam or maybe in a new original universe created specifically for the game. Both of these help to avoid retelling a story that's already been told, convoluting the UC timeline any further, retconning previous events in the UC timeline, and makes it easier for people new to the franchise to get into the series.

Second I feel given how shows in UC canon often portray infantry, vehicular, and mobile suit battles I feel that the gameplay design would be best based off of the Halo series or Battlefield with some RPG elements for character or MS customization options.  For dealing the issue of space combat which will inevitably come up I feel the developer would best look at how zero-G combat was handled in Dead Space 2 and 3 that way to avoid changing the control scheme so radically that it doesn't confuse and frustrate players.

-Kio meets Ezlecant  
-confirmed future Vagan-Gundam  
-Kio gets special treatment because he resembles Ezlecant's deceased son(Romy)  
-Kio is allowed to wander around Vagan, in order to see who his ""enemy"" really is  
-gets his stuff jacked by Bucktooth Ben, only to be returned by Deen  
-Deen takes Kio home and they meet his sister Lu  
-At dinner, Lu is revealed to have the Mars Disease and is bed-ridden and has an expectancy of only 3 more monthes  
-Ezlecant describes how Vagans eventually stop caring about other people because they're afraid of loss  
-Ezlecant is trying to teach Earthlings the value of life, when he only has 6 monthes left to live  
-Episode ends with Zeheart about to start Project Eden, the ""big mission"", and Zanald fabricating parts for the Vagan Gundam (Regulus/Legilis Gundam)  
  
My Thoughts  
A very nice break from the fighting, Ezlecant being portrayed like a caring father allows the Vagans to be shown in a victimized light. The ""dead son"" dynamic is a good tool for explaining why Kio is treated so well even though hes an enemy pilot. The Deen and Lu scenes were really well done and again build on the victim idea.  
Then there's Zanald, who would rather interrogate and than execute Kio. All he wants is the Gundam and its technology in order to annihilate all his enemies, even outright saying that he may ignore Ezlecant's wishes and kill Kio himself. More possible evidence of a split in the Vagan.  

Preview [""Fugitive Kio""  
Asemu arrives to rescue Kio, but according to the announcer, Kio has difficulty saying Goodbye, implied also by the shot of a happy Lu. So, we may finally get to see Asemu and Kio together since his BIRTH, and how this trip has affected Kio. If we're REALLY lucky, we may get to see the Regulus](/spoiler)

-Flit saves Kio in his OG AGE-1  
-Kio is told to retreat while Flit takes on both Zeheart and Zanald, even volunteering to remain behind so the Diva can escape  
-Kio refuses to leave Flit behind so he returns to the battle, just to get captured AGAIN  
-AGE-1 is disabled by Zeheart, but is saved by the Diva  
-Captain has to decide to prioritize escaping or saving AGE-3, hesitation leads to not saving Kio  
-Diva is gonna meet up with the Madorna Workshop to resupply  
-Flit is desperate to repair the AGE-1 and go after Kio  
-While at the workshop, Flit gets a call from Asemu (Reddit thumbnail), Asemu says that they are prepared to go rescue Kio  
-Kio looks scared for his life in the Vagan Brig, meanwhile they are analyzing the AGE-3  
  
My Thoughts  
REALLY enjoyed this episode, alot of relationship building and character development  
-The now completely obvious competition between Zanald and Zeheart  
-Fram, initially distrustful of Zeheart, seems like she's growing to respect him for his caring personality  
-The Madorna family, ya that was pretty funny  
-The Captain and Abis, pretty touching with Abis always trying to support her  
-Flit and Asemu, Flit still hates Asemu for abandoning them, but submits to save Kio, also Asemu brings up valid points about the advantages of being a pirate  
-Flit finally gets some character time as he pretends his priority is AGE-3, but really just wants to save his grandson. Maybe because he doesnt want to fail like he thought he did with Asemu?

-Zeheart is willing to sacrifice countless Vagans to win  
-Ghosts from Zeheart's past cause doubt in his path  
-Fram is to be suicidal bait to destroy the Gundam and Diva  
-Asemu saves Kio from Fram  
-Leil saves Fram from Asemu  
-Vagans connect the Digmazeon cannon to Second Moon to recharge it  
-Flit volunteers the Diva to be the decoy while the other ships withdraw  
-Diva's crew abandons ship while Flit launches in the AGE-1 Glansa  
-Diva's crew is picked up by the Baronoke  
-Obright SKEWERS Leil  
-Jonathan is taken out by Fram  
-Obright and Fram deal fatal blows to each other and are trapped  
-Zeheart has an x-rounder connection with Fram to apologize for letting her die  
-Digmazeon cannon fires, taking out Zanald, a large amount of Vagan and Federation forces, Obright, Fram, and the Diva  
-The Gundams survive, a discovery that pushes Zeheart off the deep end and he launches in the Legilis to confront them  
-Asemu defeats Zeheart, they have a brief reconciliation before the Legilis explodes  
  
**My Thoughts**  
Jesus christ, they're not holding back anymore. 6 Named characters dying in such a short span. Fram's death was pretty dark because she allowed herself to be used as a tool because of her deep support for Zeheart. Zanald just getting blatantly killed off could've been done better. Leil had no character time so ya. Jonathon was pretty sad. Obright's was downright depressing, especially because he was kicking ass and because of going down with the Diva, his and Remi's home. Diva's destruction was pretty sad after we've followed it since the beginning, almost a White Base moment.  
Now Zeheart, I find it pretty disappointing they let him become such a tool. He bet everything on the fact that every sacrifice he's made would be redeemed if he won; unfortunately, it didn't happen that way. He lost himself and in process lost everyone and everything he held dear.  
This final battle is, at least imo, redeeming alot of the slower parts of the series. Its no masterpiece, but I think that in the future I will judge AGE by these recent episodes more than the rest.  
  
**Preview** [""A Long Journey's End""  
Holy fuck its the last episode. Dying Ezlecant is in his bed, and the Vagan pilot should be Zera Gins? AGE-1 is shown with destroyed arms. AGE-FX is fighting something in a large room.

Mobile Fighter G Gundam was excellent, Seed wasn't too bad, I enjoyed the first Gundam movie (never saw the series) and Char's Counterattack was good too.
Hell, I even sat through G Saviour (somehow).
Unicorn though, everything just feels right. From the story, to the character development, right to the all important mech designs.

-Former Federation Ace Girard Spriggan is an x-rounder and is killing federation suits  
-Her funnels both fire beams and can become drills to pierce her enemies  
-She interrupts Fram and Kios battle to fight Kio  
-Zeheart still refuses to believe Asemu about the true Ezlecant  
-Flit launches in his rebuilt AGE-1 Clanche  
-Girard's real name is Reina Spriggan  
-Reina was a test pilot for the federation  
-Her boyfriend/fellow test-pilot Fornell died while testing new x-rounder technology that went out of control because the Federation valued results over safety  
-Feds covered it up by blaming Fornell and promoting Reina  
-Reina changed her name to his (Girard Fornell)  
-Spriggan suffers from some sort of X-rounder feedback  
  
**My Thoughts**  
Meh episode. Spriggan's suit looks ugly, the fights weren't too interesting. The episode took too long to reveal Spriggan's past so nothing else had a chance to progress. Everyone is still the same, Zeheart is still a blind idiot, Fram is his bitch, Kio is Kira, Flit is Mr. Genocide. Really wish they made progress this episode, the only way to redeem it is to make Spriggan play a very important role in the episodes to come. If this is just another quick ""war sucks"" message like Shanalua than I'll be pretty disappointed.

1339364109.0	uv46e	"Gundam AGE Episode 35 ""The Cursed Treasure"" Discussion"	ExpiredSushi	9	0	12	"Summary  
-Flit essentially disowns Asemu  
-They find a message capsule attached to the AGE-3  
-Vagan development of X-transmitter, allowing Zeheart to control multiple bits at once  
-Zanald and Zeheart plan a pincer attack on Diva  
-Obright gets some of the spotlight with the ""Diva is my home""  
-new AGE-3 parts, the G-Viper, that creates the AGE-3 Orbital, basically just better control for space, also apparently has curving beams?  
-the ""Cursed Treasure"" turns out to be the EXA-DB, a database of weapons from the Colony Nation Wars  
-Zeheart reveals that Ezelcant, 80 years ago, found part of EXA-DB, which is how Vagan got all their tech  
-No one knows where EXA-DB is, Asemu found it on a asteroid before, but then lost it, now its a race to find it  
-Vagan pincer attack  
-Vagan are trying to capture the Gundam  
-Zanald PENETRATES the AGE-3 with a huge beam through the torso  
  
My Thoughts  
Flit disowning Asemu was interesting, he's glad Asemu is alive, but refuses to accept that he is a traitor. The introduction of the EXA-DB gives us a main goal for this season, also nice to add in the history of Vagan tech. Obright's moment was heartwarming to say the least, I genuinely feel bad for him. More evidence of competition in the Vagans, who gets to destroy the gundam. Probably one of the better cliffhanger episode endings of the entire series.  
  
Preview [Stolen Gundam  
Flit looks like hes about to rush out to save Kio, despite everyone's protests. Age-1 is seen in combat, but isn't the AGE-1 still at the Luna base? If so, then the Federation Ace is making an appearance? A grazing vagan shot on the Diva's command center. Based on what I can see, I'm half-expecting some sort of Kira Yamato moment of Ace pilot flying in with the AGE-1 and saving Kio and the Diva](/spoiler)

Shivershorts	9	0	36	"I recently picked up my torrent habits again and the first thing I decided to do was watch Gundam Wing from start to finish. It was my childhood favorite and I figured I could finally watch it from start to finish as an adult instead of catching random episodes as a kid and only thinking *WOW FIGHTING ROBOTS!!!*

Anyway, as I'm progressing, I'm becoming more and more excited about the idea of acquiring more series to watch. But after doing some research I realized that a lot of the different series take place within the same universe (Universal Century). I'm the kinda guy that, if I were to watch something like 08th MS Team (I caught some eps of it when it aired on Toonami and it looked pretty wicked), would want to watch *all* the best series from the UC (Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta, 08th MS Team, 0080, 0083, and Unicorn seem to be the most favored shows from what I've read).

Of course I've also heard a lot about other favorite Gundam series that take place in their own alternate universes (Turn A, X, 00, and Seed seem favored). These seem appealing to me because I loved self-contained stories/universes when it comes to anime series. However, I still like the idea of getting into the Earth Federation/Zeon war series and tackling all the favorites.

My questions: would you recommend I watch the shows pertaining to the Universal Century first? Would doing so increase my appreciation of the alternate universe series? There are so many to pick from and I don't know where to start."	t5_2sjr4	True

1372725584.0	1hgq50	Upcoming contest... Win a copy of The Origin vol 3!	Falldog	9	2	0	"As many of you know I've been a big proponent of Vertical's release of Gundam: The Origin. While the first two volumes have been fantastic the blurbs on the back cover have given me a nice chuckle. Volume I's was ridiculously over dramatic while Volume's II run-on with *random emphasis* was just silly. 


Thus drives the premise of this contest. The goal? Create a blurb, describing the series, which would fit perfectly on the back of the cover of an upcoming Origin release.

While part of me thinks it would be great to see silly entries it would be fantastic if a well worded blurb could get consideration for print from Vertical. 


A bit of a pipe dream? Perhaps... Yet I won't let a good suggestion go to waste! The most beloved entry will win a copy of **The Origin volume 3**! 


The rules are simple...

* Each blurb must be no more than 80 words in length
* Each user can enter up to three times
* Winner must be able to receive a shipment from Amazon US
* I may make up more rules between now and the start of the contest
* Well reasoned objections to the rules or means of contest will be considered


**Don't share your ideas or blurb just yet!** Start thinking about it, maybe write down a rough draft. I'd like to give everyone a bit of time to think of something fantastic without needing to feel rushed with an entry. Sometime in the next week I'll post the official contest submission. When the time comes simply post your best blurb, one per top level comment. Vote results will be hidden so all entries will be treated as equally as possible. Roughly a week after I'll reveal the votes and we'll have our winner. 


I do understand that people who post early will be more likely to accumulate more votes so that's why I'm making this announcement early. That way, to the best of my ability, everyone will have an equal opportunity.


P.S. - For all of the comments below I'll have ""contest mode"" enabled just for testing to ensure that it'll be well suited for when this contest starts. 

P.P.S.S. - The Origin, volume 5, is currently available for pre-order on Amazon, and I presume, other stores as well."	t5_2sjr4	True

If you were an Ace pilot of any faction (Zeon/EFSF/Oz/Zaft/etc.), what would be your suit of choice?  
Your ""ace"" name?  
Ace squads are allowed, just keep it reasonable (nothing like whole Newtype Battalions)  
Also try to keep the technology consistent with the time period, no Zakus with Fin-funnels.  
  
-""Everfree Vanguard"" of Zeon  
-Squad of 3-5 Dom's armed with its standard Bazookas as well as Beam Rifles and Beam Naginatas taken from the Gelgoogs. (have yet to decide on a color scheme)  
  
Big fan of the Dom as well as the Black Tri-stars so why not? Equip them better and they become all the more deadly. The name comes from the idea that the squad would be so unstoppable that they were ""everfree"" and would be the spearhead of the Zeon forces like a Vanguard. And as much as I disliked Destiny, I loved their version of the Black Tri-Stars because they just bowled through everything in their way and cleared the battlefield with ease.

-New Vagan x-rounder corps, including Deen  
-Zanald doesn't accept Zeheart as Ezlecant's Successor  
-Seric Abis takes out Godom Tyneham, and than gets torn in two by a Vagan ship  
-Abis's machine gets caught on a Vagan ship and the Diva refuses to fire the photon blaster with him trapped  
-Abis convinces Captain Natora to fire, killing him  
-Deen finds Kio, but is easily defeated  
-Deen and Kio reconcile, but Deen is killed when Zanald shoots through him to try and hit Kio  
-FX BURST MODE  
-Kio snaps and goes G1 Flit on Zanald, but regains his senses before he could deliver the final blow  
  
**My Thoughts**  
Finally, this series is really picking up. I wanted character death and I wasn't disappointed! Starting to resemble Zeta Gundam with that ways some of these characters are getting shafted.  
I liked Seric as a character, he was the rational guy you just respected. His death making Natora a true captain was pretty good.  
Deen vs Kio was pretty interesting, I really enjoyed the way it recreated the Desil vs Flit battle from G1. Seeing Kio at his worst is pretty interesting, even though the battle was barely animated. I also like how they used it to show contrast between Flit and Kio, Kio regains his senses afterward while Flit just turned into a maniac.  
  
**Preview** [""Glimmer of Despair""  
well, based on the narration, seems like more death to come! Alot of face shots so hopefully more Vagan's die and Zeheart realizes hes a tool who has given up on his beliefs.

-Whadduya know, Ezelcant is piloting the Legillis  
-Two of Asemu's followers are killed effortlessly by Legillis  
-Asemu takes on Ezelcant so Kio can escape  
-Kio refuses to defect, but also refuses to fight Ezelcant  
-Zanald appears with Vagan reinforcements  
-Bisidian Pirates reinforcements appear  
-Project Eden is revealed to be the recreation of the human race except only with the genetically superior people  
-Nora and Angel were just pressure to bring out the superior, and ""accidents"" in Vagan did the same  
-AGE-3 Orbital parts are destroyed, but they send out the regular AGE-3 parts  
-Ezelcant sort of believes the Kio is his son (Romy) reborn  
-AGE-3 can't keep up with Kio's commands but Ezelcant fails to deal the final blow  
-Bisidian Pirates demand a Vagan withdraw, by threatening to crash three asteriods into the Vagan colony, asteroids turn out to be dummies filled with a smokescreen  
-Deen joins the Vagan Military  
  
My Thoughts  
First off, nice to see the Dark Hound and Legillis get plenty of action. Also, nice to show that AGE-3 isnt good enough for Kio, so heavy implication hes gonna get a new gundam, specially since AGE-3 is a wreck now. I'm liking the Bisidians because they are actually COMPETENT unlike the grunts of G1 and G2.  
Now, about Ezelcant, i REALLY wish they hadn't turned him into a genocidal monster...., I liked the image of the caring father of Vagan. Project Eden kinda reminds me of the Destiny Plan of Seed Destiny (SORRY), in the way ur genetics determine your future. What it looks like at this point, Zeheart, as a very caring commander, is gonna defect from Vagan to stop Ezlecant. Zanald is sketchy, he seems really loyal to Ezlecant, even though he disagrees with some of Ezlecant's decisions, so only time will tell with that one.  
As for Deen, I really can't wait for how the writers use him against Kio.  
  
Preview [""Kios Decision: Together with the Gundam""  
Kio returns to Earth, and BEHOLD AGE-FX, which looks like its ""funnels"" are flying blades like those from the AGE-1 Spallow. It also describes that Kio will ""discover his path,"" and I really hope its just Kill Ezlecant, help Vagan.

So recently my fiancee and I have been rewatching Zeta Gundam, and we just finished episode 28. This is the episode where Reccoa infiltrates the Jupitris with a Gelgoog  and meets Scirocco for the first time. By the end of the episode she can't stop thinking about him and even has a mild hallucination of him in her drawing. Also in this episode is the first time we see Sarah start her ""worship"" of Scirocco, which is a bit of character switch from how shes been acting. 

My fiancee pointed out that both Sarah and Reccoa were obviously being influenced by Scirocco, and then it hit me. That's part of Scirocco newtype powers. No seriously, hear me out. I looked everywhere, the wiki, fan sites, etc, and every single one comes up with the same thing. Scirocco is an evil genius who has the highest fucking charisma score in Gundam, and entices women to his side pretty friggin' easily. 

Now even I have a hard time believing he manages to enthrall so many with just charisma. We know that he made Kamille go insane at the end of the series, and that's all we ever see of his ""power."" But that's just it, what if his actual new type powers are literal mental manipulation of people.

It makes sense really. With Kamille, he literally just tries to rip out his mind, and it does a pretty good number on our hero. But then there's everyone else. If his attack on Kamille was ""brute force,"" what if instead it's just usually incredibly subtle? He uses his charisma and newtype powers to ""plant a seed"" in your mind that nudges your subconscious towards Scirocco and his goals. Perhaps this power entices women so easily because he can weave a little forced affection into the mix, making them think they're falling for him. 

So there's my crazy theory. Tear it apart. 

**TL;DR:** Scirocco isn't the best ladies man in Gundam, his special newtype power is mental manipulation and it works on women a whole lot better than men"	t5_2sjr4	True

If it isn't for the fact that exia/00 is overpowered compared to Setsuna's enemies' mech, Setsuna would've been dead.

The weakest Gundam Pilot of all time, imo, would be Cagali from SEED.  She was seriously garbage, and in Destiny she gets Akatsuki, but she didn't really pilot it that much.

It seems to me that as much of cannon fodder as a GM is, they sure do seem to roll out new ones pretty quickly. Just three years after the end of the OYW, Anaheim Electronics is still making top of the line suits for the federation, which any good military contractor would (Gundams, GMs, etc). However, doesn't it seem a bit odd that we wouldn't see a plethora of older suits still in use? It seems like Zeon sure does use the Zaku, Gelgoog and Dom quite a bit. I know the US Military still uses older equipment, and I can't imagine Mobile suits would be much different. Heck, even major airline companies still fly jets that are 10+ years old. Was it ever explained why there isn't a huge number of older GMs flooding the battlefield in the later UC series? Or were they really just all destroyed?	t5_2sjr4	True

It's said early on that GN particles jam radio, radar and possibly some other EM frequencies. If that's the case, what are Gundams using to communicate with Ptolemaios and between units? There's enough bandwidth to put both audio and video through.

If I were to guess, I'd bet quantum entanglement, or plain old laser beam. It's just never mentioned explicitly in the series, I think.

This theme of communication jamming is present in other Gundam timelines as well, am I right?"	t5_2sjr4	True
