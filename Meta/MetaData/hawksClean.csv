1372188130.0	1h21pp	What this Stanley Cup win was for...	WrongWayKid	436	49	53	"This was for having to endure a lock out that cut our precious hockey season in half, where many of us thought there would be no hockey to be played this year.

This is for the total lack of credit this team was given before the start of the season by the media, fans, and yes even some of us.

This was for [dethroning the reigning Champions in game one of the season.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Ku1VIMteQ)

This was for [dispelling demons against the Coyotes..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRxhsPxlW4) and for  [Mayers, making Torres answer for his sins of last season.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USzR5wqQ1Yo)

This was for the [Kaner's no look behind the back pass to beat Dallas.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lchGIypZ5Yw)

This was for the [Leddy OT winner against the Red Wings, to set a franchise record with 6 consecutive victories to start the season.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coRQVyblli4)

...for [Hossa sending it to OT with 2 seconds remaining against the Flames, to preserve the point streak.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nm_WNpk-9Q)

This was for the lengthy absence of a shut out, [ending in Nashville](http://video.blackhawks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?hlg=20122013,2,171&amp;cmpid=embed-share-video), nearly 2 years since our last shut out occurred.

...for [more Hossa OT heroics..](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC7zk1xRykc)

This was for Corey Crawford, [silencing critics and making us all believe in the big Craw Daddy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY7MSCwItHw)

This was for [Kaner's late powerplay goal against Detroit, to preserve the streak at 22.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkoM6EZPWqw) And for [his spin-o-rama backhander a few nights later in Dallas.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crTXqfGBwbQ)

This was for the for the historic point streak, [coming to an unfortunate end against the Avalanche.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4AaaruqKMc)

...for doing it [without Sharpie and Hoss.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7k_BT2mnNE)

This was for being the [first team to clinch a playoff spot with a 5-3 win against the Predators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyJ9-7qvb8c)...then the [division 5 nights later against the Red Wings.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXkIGpXcV18)

This was for Kane's game winner, [a breakaway wrister to clinch the Presidents' Trophy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ2RxIWjfHM)

...for big dick Bickell showing us just how [big it was early in the playoffs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKOK_utJrYg)

This is for [taming the Wild.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXSx8UoZos)

...and for being [pushed to the brink.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKDwed3Xrnw) Only to see what [this team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OLCaa1GSVM) is really [made of.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYYHNvS2ffk)

This is certainly for a [fitting last end against a division rival.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO_g0ZsF4C8)

For ['Zus chasing Quick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ec57C6lQ4)...and for [Crow standing up for his Captain.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gTpnt5ycSg)

This was for [Hjalmarsson's sacrifice, against the Kings.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf-4t_Jewno)

This is for the [hat trick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPi2a1u9a7Q) that sent us to the finals.. and the [Clarence Campbell Bowl.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf13QwBYtfE) Remember, [no touching!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqzfey9tut1qexpu1o1_500.gif)

...for [this fuckin' guys' triple overtime winner.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXbXf_v_TYc)

And sure as hell it's for Seabiscuit, [winning it again for us in overtime.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac6F-C8bDtI) Proving once again, that adversity is just a word to this team.

For Patty Kane, [showing us why](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGNs2CreElQ) he is the [Conn Smythe Trophy winner.](http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/sports/photos/2013/06/24/940-patrick-kane-conn-smythe-trophy.jpg)

For [17 seconds...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxoo6eenBbE)

...and [the last 24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKzCLAvNM40)...

For [OUR cup..](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22xUeD_TGDE)

For [OUR Captain!](http://i.imgur.com/ldYycdY.jpg)

For [OUR team..](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/934/336/Screenshot2013-06-24at11.37.17PM_original.png?1372142347)

For [OUR city...](http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/Sports/AP_NHL/201306212207796745783-p5.jpg)

...and for [us fans.](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2832859/chicagowoooo.gif)

And let us not forget, for [Chelsea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEXHeTcxQy4)

Enjoy the fuck out of this win, /r/Hawks, we're the best of the best! You all are amazing, and I look forward to the off-season and future seasons with you guys!

I went into the Cup wanting to hate you guys. I really did - but I couldn't.

Throughout the series, your team and you guys, the fans, proved yourselves to be a true Original Six team with a true love of the game. And that ad just solidified my impression of Chicago as a class act.

Thank you Chicago for showing me that I don't need to have a bloodthirsty hate for the other team (***cough Vanfuckingcouver***).

We followed a lockout with 24 straight games with a point, the first team ever to do that. We only lost 7 games in regulation.... 7. We have made it to the Stanley Cup for the 2nd time in 4 years after playing one of the best 7 game comeback series of all time against Detroit to send them to their new division crying. Even if we lose, we still keep almost all of our team. Our prospect pool is deep. We have the top scorer in the AHL and so many other great players coming up to insure that our next 8 seasons will be nothing short of great. Be happy people, enjoy the shit out of this!

1359436529.0	17hath	Welcome new Blackhawks fans, a quick primer...	honestbleeps	129	13	84	"Posts like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawks/comments/17gdul/ive_noticed_this_way_too_much_in_the_recent_days/) irritate me, so I wanted to give another old-timer's fans perspective....

Why does it irritate me?  Because I can tell from many of the posts in there that it makes new fans feel self conscious / like they're somehow supposed to live up to some ""Blackhawks fan standard""...  That's freaking stupid.

I've loved the Blackhawks since the early 1980's when I was a toddler. This doesn't make me a better fan than you. It makes me someone who happened to know people into hockey when I was quite young, and I got hooked. That's about it.

Here's what you need to know to be a ""good"" Blackhawks fan:

1) Try and understand the game beyond just the scoresheet. The most enjoyable part of a live hockey game is seeing SO much more than you can see on TV - including all of the subtle things the players who **don't** have the puck are doing.  Positioning, jostling with other players, making smart cuts to open areas or anticipating a play... That's the cerebral part of the game, and understanding it will put you ahead of 90% of fans and probably 85% of Chicago-area newspaper beat writers, too (who are mostly AWFUL).

2) Ask questions if you don't know something.  Most of the ""hardcore"" hockey fans are totally psyched to hear that other people around them are interested in *hockey*, and not *the wrigley-esque experience* that the UC has started to become.  You're not going to be mocked - you're going to be welcomed with open arms!  We'd much rather you ask questions than pretend you know everything and ramble on about which players suck. Trust me.

3) Ignore any criticism of your fandom. Is it your fault Blackhawks home games weren't on TV until about 4 or 5 years ago?  No.  Anyone who's looking down on ""newbies"" or ""bandwagoners"" measures too much of their personal identity by their Blackhawks fandom.. maybe it's time for them to find another hobby.  (This, by the way, coming from a guy who has missed a total of 2 home games since the 2008-09 season, and only because he HAD to.  I'm obsessed with the game and the team, but it doesn't make me cooler than a new fan, if anything it makes me a bit of a freak).

4) Don't jump to conclusions on ""blame"" for a bad outcome until you understand the game better.  It's a team sport, and rarely is anything one player's fault (yes, that includes goalies)...  Statistics don't always tell the whole picture, and the most ""hockey smart"" fans know this.  Pay attention to who was in the right/wrong spot and where the breakdowns were when something goes wrong.  

5) Same goes for a positive outcome.  Sure, the star of the team may have had that goal - but was a 4th line grinder about to leave the ice before he saw an opportunity to run hard at the opponent and chip a puck past him which is what started the whole sequence in the first place?  Probably. It's that hard but not directly rewarding work that goes unnoticed by most fans.

There ya go. You're equipped to be as worthy a Blackhawks fan as me or anyone else on earth.  Enjoy the sport. It is really, really amazing.

p.s.: You really have to see it live if you haven't. It's 10x better than TV."	t5_2rhes	True

I went to probably 15 Seattle Thunderbird (WHL) games a year with my Dad, and loved every second of it. 
   The Thunderbirds moving from Key Arena coincided with my parent's ugly divorce and the worsening of my Dad's alcoholism. As a result, I've only been to one hockey game in the last few years.
   This year I moved out to Chicago for my freshman year of College, and immediatley decided to start following the Blackhawks and he Bulls, as my city is currently without a NHL or NBA team. I have to say I got pretty lucky to start my fandom this year, as it has been so rewarding to be a fan of a successful team, something I havent experienced much as a Seattle Sports fan.
   Anyways, today is my 20th birthday, and my Dad turns 50 Thursday. He's been working very hard on his problems with addiction recently, and even though we are halfway across the country, our relationship has started to recover. 
   As a birthday present, he flew out to Chicago and got two tickets in the 100 level for Monday night's game vs the Hawks. I was absolutley blown away by the whole experience. A packed house for a hockey game is something I never experienced rooting for a team of young kids in the Western hockey League, and the rocking United Center made quite the impression on me.
    I got shivers all through the national anthem, which Jim nailed like usual, especially after the moment of silence. Anyways, i know I kind of rambled but I had such a great time with my Dad who, being away at school, I haven't seen all year. Much thanks to the team and the fans."	t5_2rhes	True

I made a wager with /u/cubicle_jockey on /r/hockey that the Hawks would finally get their regulation loss between Feb 20 and Feb 27. As you know they didn't and here I am writing this. I apologize to cubicle_jockey for taking so long to post this, but here I am finally paying up.

Chicago is the best team in the NHL, and anyone who doesn't believe it is a moron. They have all of the tools that make a successful team in the NHL. With the offensive powerhouses in Towes, Kane, and Hossa, great D from Keith and Seabrook, and Crawford is playing out of his mind and Ray Emery has also stepped up his game.

I can't think of a core of forwards that is better than Chicago. Toews is the most well rounded and hard working player in the league; it seems that there is nothing that he can't do. Kane has some of the best moves I have seen, that shootout goal yesterday was a masterpiece. Hossa is doing very well, especially considering he is coming off that horrible concussion from the playoffs, it is good to see that he hasn't missed a beat. Along with the superstars even players like Brandon Saad have picked up their game and are contributing on offense. 

Your defense lead by Keith and Seabrook is a very solid core. Keith is a great D-man who will do pretty much anything for his team. I gained infinite respect for him when he took that puck to the face, lost 7 teeth and still played in the game. He is one tough player and he is one of the most underrated defensemen in the league. It seems that Seabrook is always on the ice. He is playing crazy minutes and is everywhere. 

Corey Crawford has really come into his own. He is impenetrable, he is always in the right position, and is just playing out of his mind. When he is hurt or having an off day, no worries, Ray Emery has become a totally different netminder and is almost as solid as Crawford is, if not more. They both are having career seasons and it doesn’t seem that things will slow down. 

Along with all of the talent you have, the best thing about this team is that every player is earning his paycheck and then some. No one is slacking off or underperforming, and that is something that no other team in the NHL can say. 

At first glance at the roster, you wouldn't think that this team would be the powerhouse that they are, especially looking at goaltending, but with the way that everyone has stepped up their game, especially Crawford and Emery, this team is in it to win it."	t5_2rhes	True

Sticktap to /u/gthank and /u/radd_it for the primary &amp; second assists on my goal of bringing user-editable flair to /r/hawks! I'd also like to thank /u/docblue for reminding my dumb ass that this still needed to be done.

Find the ""Show my flair on this subreddit"" bit at the top of the sidebar, click EDIT, select the flair icon you want, then fill in the text box with your text flair if you'd like. Click save.

Bask in your newfound glory. **As we get more numbers/graphics, I'll add them**.

GO HAWKS!!!

EDIT: If you choose to add text flair in addition to your flair icon, the text flair will show up as a tooltip when you hover your mouse over your flair icon.

EDIT2: Reddit relies heavily on browser caching for performance. If you flair isn't showing up correctly, log out of Reddit (the horror, I know...), clear the cache &amp; cookies in your browser, then log back into Reddit. That should resolve the issue.

EDIT3: The option for text-only flair has been added. Just select the iconless option at the bottom of the flair list. Thanks /u/gumstead for bringing that to my attention. 

**FINAL EDIT: All numbers, past &amp; present, are complete and functional. Thank you, /u/SteveJankowski1, for whipping those out faster than Anthony Weiner on Snapchat.**

Also, please upvote this submission for maximum visibility. It is a text post, I receive no karma. Thanks!"	t5_2rhes	True

It looked to me like the Kings were just out for BLOOD!  They were beating the shit out of us!  They wouldnt open up Quicks weak side so that we could get in their alley, the game all and all was hard to watch as a huge hawks fan, but i stayed optimistic in the fact that the Crow had some AMAZING saves!  The kings have not lost a home game in the playoffs, so I knew it was going to be a rough match.  In the 3rd period, I think that the hawks learned a lot about a home match at staples center, and I dont think that game 4 will have the same outcome as game 3.  GO HAWKS!!!	t5_2rhes	True

Not untill now some of the rules have been written down. This all started from every time Pat Foley (CSN Home announcer) yells ""GREAT SAVE!!"". If you're from Chicago or have watched a Blackhawks game with the CSN announcers...you know what I mean.

So here are some of the rules:





Blackhawks Drinking Game:

* Each Blackhawks goal. (1 Drink)

* Every time Pat Foley yells ""GREAT SAVE!"" (1 Drink)

* When a player gets kicked out of the face-off. (1 Drink)

* If so happens a 2nd player of the same team gets kicked out of the face-off and a penalty ensues...(1 SHOT)

* Eddie O says ""For all you young hockey fans out there..."" (2 Drinks)

* When a fight breaks out, CHUG until the fight is over.

* 1 drink for every ""Birthday Shout-Out""

* If Bolland scores...(Smerk a Berl)

* Any general shout-out. (1 Drink)

* Any time Foley mentions Eddie O's awesomeness, jersey, or the fact he's from the Chicagoland. (1 Drink each)

* Every time someone calls the goalie the wrong name. Crawford/Emery. (1 Drink)

The Hawks were the best team in the league from start to finish, and I'm proud of the Bruins for giving it their all through six games. It's amazing that we got this far considering Iginla choosing Pittsburgh over Boston, being down 4-1 against Toronto, and the fact that out scumbag asshole of an owner nearly got the season cancelled over what's chump change for people like him. 

It's refreshing to see a team that plays the right way on both ends of the ice win it all. This is also the first time since 2008 that the Bruins have been eliminated by a team that was legitimately better than they are (albeit not by much) which makes losing less painful. 

I love how loud your arena is. I love your anthem singer. I love Chelsea Dagger. You guys are a team I typically root for in the West, and I'm glad the series was devoid of the Montreal/Pittsburgh/Vancouver whining bullshit that usually comes with series the Bruins might lose. I said to myself during the lockout that even if the Canucks played the Habs in the Final, I'd just be happy there was a season, but I'm glad to have this sweeter bittersweet ending instead.

So, it is time for all good Blackhawks fans to come to the aid of their most beloved subreddit.

Are you a Photoshop powerhouse? A GIMP guru? An MS Paint pimp? A Corel Draw dinosaur?

The best hockey subreddit on the planet needs **YOU**. Yes, you. No, not the scuzzy looking guy behind you with the Winterhawks sweater and fedora. We need **YOU**.

Well, a part of you, anyway. **NO**. Not that part. The BIG head part. Well, and your silky smooth hands. And your eyes. But that's it. Well, and this paddleball game...

Our fearless mod, /u/SteveJankowski1 was the hero behind the original 7 images for the flair upgrade. However, Steve has a pretty demanding work life, and he's not able to devote much time to working on more numbers and different logo designs. As for me, I'm not that great with Photoshop. I could probably take the next two months to work on it, but I'd just turn out something that looks like the monkeys at Brookfield flung feces at your monitor, so that is right out. What we need is one or more volunteers.

So who's in?

The images need to be 30px X 30px, jpg or png. I do not have the template for the originals, but I'll check with Steve to see if it's possible to get them. If there's anything else I can do to assist you, just PM me or whatever. Once you have some images to submit, PM me and I'll send you a link to upload them into the supersecret /r/hawks Dropbox.

Finally, one last thing. There's some big changes coming for the overall design of the sub. Keep your eyes peeled for a suggestions thread sometime in the next week or two.

***Also, please kindly upvote this submission for maximum visibility. It is a text post, so I receive no karma.***

You guys are the best, thank you!

**EDIT:** Stay tuned, sportsfans...don't touch that dial. You may have a full roster of sweaters to choose from soon.  LIKE BEFORE THE WEEKEND BEGINS SOON. Developing...

**EDIT2: BOOM! DONE.** Great thanks to /u/SteveJankowski1 for knocking this out in record time. If your flair looks funky, try clearing cookies/cache. If that doesn't work, just reselect it.

**GO HAWKS!!!**

My **Facebook** feed is full of people talking about how ""even the Avs beat them, Chicago was just lucky this year""

Jesus! Both teams are good, it was a tough series that was well earned for either team. 

Obviously not all Wings fans are this ridiculous (most really know their shit), but I can say (currently living in Michigan) it gets annoying to read my news feed during playoffs. And I'm aware that there are shitty fans for every team. 


I just had to rant.

I've been a Bruins fan since February 2000 and through that time I also fell in love with your team. Yes the early 2000s Blackhawks weren't the best team in the world, but guys like Tony Amonte, Steve Sullivan, Eric Daze, and Mark Bell all were huge favourites of mine (especially Amonte and Sullivan).  I have the up-most respect for your team and your city (especially the solidarity ad after the Boston Bombings).

You guys have an amazingly skilled team and just like before I have new favourites from your team: Patrick Kane, Duncan Keith, Captain Serious, Dave Bolland, and Corey Crawford. And I know for a fact, if my Bruins didn't exist, I'd be a Hawks fan. You guys are a tremendous talent and I am beyond happy to have you as an opponent. 

May the best team win guys, and no matter the outcome; I will always have respect and love for the Blackhawks and your city.

I think I speak for all Detroit fans when I say this, but this will be incredibly exciting! The Blackhawks are a GREAT hockey team with equally exceptional fans. You all here on reddit have only reaffirmed my belief that Hawks fans are smart, knowledgeable, and level-headed hockey fans who love the game!

Now, as for /r/hockey game threads we at /r/detroitredwings would like for the Hawks to host the game threads for games at the United Center. That way you get a little ""home thread"" advantage. /u/golf4miami is excellent at running these and he is my candidate. (which may be the same for some of you as well.) That way when the series comes back to the Joe one of our guys can host it like /u/DDCDT123. 

That's all for now! I wish you guys a great series and the best of luck! Here's to a final hurrah to a great playoff rivalry! (Until we play each other for a Stanley Cup!)

1364252761.0	1b06sw	Blackhawks vs Kings 3/25 7:00PM CDT [Game Thread]	docblue	37	7	87	"KINGS (17-12-2) at BLACKHAWKS (24-3-3)

TV: TSN2, NBCSN, CSN-CH

Last 10: Los Angeles 5-5-0; Chicago 7-3-0

Season series: Monday marks the third and final meeting, with Chicago taking the first two during their historic run to start the season. The Blackhawks beat the Kings 5-2 in their season opener day at Staples Center and again on Feb. 17, when they allowed two late goals but held on for a 3-2 victory.

Big story: When will Los Angeles score another goal? With a 126:14 goal drought dating back to the winner against Phoenix on March 19, many of the Kings’ faithful are hoping their team turns it around, and soon. It won’t be an easy task against the Blackhawks, who own the League’s best record due in large part to a suffocating defense.

Team scope:

Kings: The defending Stanley Cup champions have endured a streaky campaign thus far, and at no time was that more obvious than their recently concluded five-game homestand. Los Angeles started with a three-game win streak over four days in which the Kings outscored opponents 12-4 and gained some breathing room in the Western Conference. Then the drought hit, and the Kings lost back-to-back games to Dallas and Vancouver. Los Angeles outshot opponents 60-34 over that stretch, but couldn’t find the back of the net.

""We're not making it hard enough on the opposing team's goaltenders,"" captain Dustin Brown said. ""We've gone through spurts this year where we've scored a lot of goals, and it was just a result of getting the puck to the net with bodies at the same time. The power play has been a big source of our offense, and we had only one shot (on two opportunities).""

Blackhawks: Chicago is back at the United Center after a four-game road trip. The Blackhawks went 3-1-0, but the lone loss came in Anaheim – the only team challenging Chicago for the West’s top spot – in the trip’s final leg. Chicago took a 2-1 lead into the third period, but Anaheim found its offense in the final 20 minutes, scoring three times to extend its franchise-record 13-game home winning streak.

""It's frustrating, considering we thought we were looking at a 3-1 lead at one point,"" captain Jonathan Toews said, referring to a play midway through the second period when Brandon Bollig was judged to have kicked the puck into the net. ""We have to keep working and doing the right things. We played good enough to win, but made a few mistakes in the last five minutes, and they made us pay for it.""

Who’s hot: Toews has four goals and three assists in his past three games, including a shorthanded strike against the Ducks.

Injury report: Willie Mitchell is day-to-day with a knee injury, while Matt Greene’s back injury has him out indefinitely for the Kings. … Marian Hossa did not dress for Chicago’s tilt against Anaheim and is day-to-day with an upper-body injury. Patrick Sharp is on the injured reserve with a shoulder injury.

Sorry, no stats today hHawks fans. I'm not feeling well so I'm taking a break for this game. The stats will be back for tomorrow's game.

I'm posting this prior to possibly our first loss of the season, But fear not! Streaks end, They always have and they always will. Now I'm not here to make excuses like a bandwagon fan, I'm here to tell all the true Blackhawks fans that this isn't the end of anything, We are still the best in the league overall and if you think of it, They might just play better not having the pressure of the streak on each and every one of their shoulders every night

So regardless of Win or Loss tonight, Lets not jump ships and start making excuses! Lets just keep supporting our team!

1335514771.0	sv0ya	/r/Hawks we need to talk		41	10	33	"We lost in the first round and everyone's upset, I understand, but let's collect ourselves and think. 

First off, Kaner isn't going anywhere. Like or not, but get used to it. That's as absurd as asking VAN to dump a Sedin. They're faces of their fanchises respectively. 


Secondly, the defense. The Keith hate needs to stop. He had 40 points and was a +15 with a 20+ min avg TOI, that's pretty darn good. Seabs was great too with a +21, 36 points, and very similar ice time. Leddy is a young, very promising, D man who didn't have a great year but we should keep him. His mistakes will fade in time, hopefully. As far as #4 #5 #6 #20 #34 those are the guys we can lose, some we *should*. 


Now to the offense. As far as I can guess Toews, Kane, Hossa, Sharp, Bolland, and Stalberg are our main foundation of which the Hawks' game is built on. So they're staying. 

Shaw, Kruger, Mayers, and Bollig are, I'm guessing, sticking around. Mayers and Bollig are great grinders and fighters that, again like it or not, that the Hawks need. Bollig is definitely more of a risk but I think we need a guy like him to help protect Kane, Toews, and the rest. Mayers falls in the same category as Bollig but slightly more skill and good veteran experience and cool, Bollig is kind of a Pitbull on a weak chain. Shaw sticking around is obvious, no need to explain. I'll get to Kruger later. 

Morrison, Frolik, and Bickell need to go. Morrison just doesn't mesh with the team, he's old, and brings nothing to the table. Frolik and Bickell are too inconsistent and have had too many blown chances. Bickell, probably in part to the coaching staff, forgets his size and role and thinks he's sniper. Frolik just can' finish, anything. Dump em. 

Now I know some are saying Kruger is the same but, I like the guy. I don't know why. In my eyes he shows potential and room for growth. Another player in his early 20s beginning his career. 

This leaves us with Bruno, Carbomb, and Hayes. They could stay or go. Doesn't bother me either way. 


Goaltending: STFU about Craw. Hammer screwed him over more than once, closer to four or five times, that led directly to a goal in the playoffs. Our PP and PK were ugly all season and we relied on goalie wins far too often. Sure he let in soft goals but the guys young and frankly was carrying the team on his back at times. He was the best SO goalie in the league which shows he can stop the puck. Give him time and more than one good D pairing and he'll improve. 

Rant end, sorry. 

I'll edit in the morning. My iPad is pissing me off and dying. 

**EDIT 1: For some clarification, it was late when I posted this.**

* I only threw Stalberg into the ""core"" mix because I think he plays great with our top guys. Almost every game, that comes to mind, Stalberg was right in the mix of things causing problems for the opponents defense and getting great chances. Losing him would hurt the team and his speed is something we don't have a lot of.

* Concerning some of the young guys: Hayes and Olsen are not on the chopping block for me. I was merely saying that they *could* go and the team would be fine. They are good players but they are also easily replaceable players.

* Shaw: While Shaw is young, like Olsen and Hayes, he's proved himself on the ice time and time again. Do I really need to explain it any more?

* Bickell and Frolik: Sure they looked ""good"" in the playoffs, at times. But it's the playoffs! The playoffs are huge sure but you can't overlook their regular season performance. And they've never stood out of the crowd, in my mind.

* Carcillo: I know we resigned him but what about his health? Isn't his leg pretty fucked up? I know it should be healed by

1372301095.0	1h5jb5	What a difference 7 years makes...	rockymtnhigh34	33	5	9	"It's so great to see the Stanley Cup back in Chicago, but it's just been so surreal for me the last couple days.  I remember how excited the city was back in 2010, and it seems only to have increased since then.  Some would say the bandwagon has grown even more, but I don't really care about bandwagoners as long as they like hockey and want to keep watching.  What I've been thinking about most is how far this team has come in so little time.

I went to high school at Maine South in Park Ridge, and back in like 2005-2006, we used to drive down to the UC in a van and split parking at one of the lots down the street, and then show our student IDs at the gate to get in for like $7. Once inside, the building was about half full, at the most. We went to quite a few games just because of the fact there was very little to do in the burbs, but I distinctly remember one game it was so quiet during the anthem that right before it started, someone yelled out ""You suck Karpovtsev!"".  It was so loud the entire stadium heard it and there was an audible laugh. It was always fun to go watch some hockey with my buddies, but I never imagined it would get to this level.  Hell, the only way we could see home games was to actually go to the fucking stadium.  

Flash-forward to the present day. I went out to my mom's place in Des Plaines for the day to help her clean up her flooded basement, and to run some other errands. I went to Sports Authority out there to get a Stanley Cup Champions shirt, and I couldn't believe how packed it was.  There were about 10 tables right near the front all with Blackhawks championship stuff, and there were a bunch of people mulling over that stuff.  I remember going to that very same store in high school to get a Blackhawks hat and they literally had 2 to choose from.  People at school used to make fun of me for liking the Blackhawks since they were so bad. On the way home I passed [the sign](http://i.imgur.com/K8Pp8sP.jpg) in front of Our Lady of Ransom and was in disbelief. I don't get very emotional over sports, but this brought a tear to my eye for some reason. I thought back to me in high school and how no one cared about the hawks, and now to see everyone care is just so amazing. I wish I could go back now and tell 16-year-old me that this team was going to be great one day, I would love to see the look on my face.  

Some of my friends who have been longtime fans complain about all the new hawks fans, but I think it's wonderful.  This team deserves as much attention as possible and the organization has made such a great effort to make a complete 180 with the whole team from top to bottom. I'm so proud of this team and this city for finally embracing them. It feels so good to have the Blackhawks be the toast of the town in Chicago. It's incredible to be quite honest, and I love it.

So here is a tip of the hat for you all. You deserve it. It is nice playing a team that truly deserves to be here. A team that overcame adversity and never gave up hope. It is an honour to face you in the finals.

1371830962.0	1gsuke	Revisiting Game 4	Spagoo	33	8	28	"I know everyone is up Corey Crawfords ass for his ""weak glove side"" but I have to put everything into perspective here.

The goal where Saad toe-picked and faceplanted and Oduya nearly got his head blown off was a fucking rocket.  It was a horrible play by Saad on the clear, where he didn't have any pressure and just muffed it, and then obviously just wound up swimming on the ice.

The other goal from the same spot, to that same glove side, was Dave Bolland's fault, and I mean it was horrible.  Everyone on the ice was on the left side, and Bolland was the only defender even close to the right.  He decided to join in on the assault of the puck carrier, pretty much 5 on 5.  Then the carrier just dished it out right to where Bolland WAS standing, and again, a wide open shot.

Next, I am seriously wondering if something is wrong with Duncan Keith.  Going back to game 3 where he had a wide open powerplay chance, plenty of time, and he just fucking threw the puck away.  Everytime the puck came to him, he would through it to Hjalmersson's backhand, way out of his wheelhouse, and obviously #4 isn't as gifted with the puck as say Nick Leddy.  Another play, Keith skated to the puck and just missed it as he tried to reverse back into the zone.  In the middle of nowhere. No pressure, no traffic.   TURNOVER!  It was absolutely the worst game I've ever seen Keith play.  

I have to ask.  Is he OK?  Does anyone recall him getting leveled and concussed?  Seabrook has been through a couple of these bad phases too and I assume it's been related to head trauma.  He's been great throughout these playoffs though.

Johnny Oduya, thanks for contributing to the offense, somewhat, but fuck, you are a turnover machine.  LAZY PASSES!

Coach Q - Waiting for an explanation on Nick Leddy's absence. WTF?

Stalberg - As one of the biggest forwards the Hawks have.  Why are you such a pussy?  I have no problem with Q benching your ass.

Here's the players I want to recognize for their awesome plays - Michael Roszival - Rosi has had some huge Goals, redirected by Hawks in front of the net of course, but wow, who would have thought the points would be coming from this guy.  Calmly gets the puck out of the zone.

Brent Seabrook - Great shot

I don't think so, no."" I let a little incredulity slip, but managed to maintain general composure and consciouness...

The second local sports bar I tried had a disconnected phone, so then they were out. Finally, I called Buffalo Wild Wings who said they were showing it, ""..but not behind the bar."" (College women's softball, rally racing and talking heads prevail..) But at least I got to see the game!

So today, call another sports bar, and this time wisely ask, ""are you showing the LA Kings versus the Chicago Blackhawks game"" (note: LA Kings FIRST.) and dude says, ""Is that hockey? Umm, I think so...""

Don't they know that all of Chicago is still practically winter in tribute to a Hawks cup!!! LETS GO HAWKS!"	t5_2rhes	True

1367380170.0	1dgm3p	Everyone, let’s take a minute to talk about our glorious 3rd line.	StoneSoup	24	4	3	"Shaw, Stalberg, and Bickell have been money all year.  Sure, they haven’t been putting up the same kind of numbers as the top two lines, but they’ve consistently put together great shifts throughout the year.

Coach Q tinkered with the lines a lot during the second half of the season, moving each of these three around as injuries dictated and after the Handzus pickup.  But every time they get put back together, it’s as if they just pick up where they left off.  

Their chemistry is a great thing to watch.  Stalberg’s speed, Bickell’s wicked wrister, and Shaw’s meat and potatoes work behind the net helps this unit gel together in an outstanding fashion.

Only fitting that Stalberg’s streak up wide along the boards to set up a centering pass to Bickell would be the game winner tonight.  

Great win.  15 more to go.  Go Hawks!
