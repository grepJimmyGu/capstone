1346566014.0	z7ya7	First Post | Nice Room, Would like a Redesign	Pseudo-Account	22	1	6	"Hello! Thanks for reading this!

Alright, I'd enjoy redesigning my room. Here are a few pictures to give you a ""feel"" for the size of the room and design.

* This is the view from my door. [[Picture 1]](http://imgur.com/3dffv)
* This is the view from the alcove to the left. [[Picture 2]](http://imgur.com/tx39H)
* This is the view from the bed into the alcove. I do not use this television for anything (it doesn't even have cable). There is a sewing kit, since I've been trying my hand at sewing. But there's also some free space above it. [[Picture 3]](http://imgur.com/G8G1F)
* This is my closet. It only includes my shirts and dress things (shirts on the shelf thing, dress things on the hangers (mostly out of view to the left or right)) [[Picture 4]](http://imgur.com/0Fxma)
* The rest of my clothes are stored in the desk area below and to the left of my computer area. Look at picture one and it's the area that's being a bit obscured by the chair. But it is not the large alcove directly to the left of my monitors. I figured this would be a hard one to explain, so I gave a picture. [[Picture 5]](http://imgur.com/1rLyI)
___________________________________________________________

Now, on to what I have to work with, in terms of free space. 

* This is above the sewing kit (the alcove area) shown in picture 3. [[Picture 6]](http://imgur.com/BaTwR)
* This area is directly left of my computer setup. It is slightly full, but it's holding insignificant old binders that can easily be bunched up, put in storage, removed, or whatever. [[Picture 7]](http://imgur.com/veeoh)
* Also, look back at Picture 2. Look directly above my computer chassis. There is almost nothing in that area, excluding a skull that I can move around or throw out.
___________________________________________________________

So, what do I want to do with the room? It seems decent enough already?

* I would enjoy becoming more minimalist. I have lots of storage, but still some clutter left out.
* Most importantly, I'd like a way to arrange my clothes. The current system isn't very useful. 
* I'd love just something creative. Since I have a large amount of schoolwork, I'm in my room often. I want it to be great.
* Some calming things would be cool. I already burn candles (incense is preposterously expensive). What about some [bamboo plants?]
(http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_WgF9RN2LSb0/TSpT8CM_XJI/AAAAAAAAA_4/nbBzoFDz8z0/s400/bamboo1.jpg)
* If calming won't work out, I'd be fine with going more technologically oriented. I'm thinking about setting up a Raspberry Pi mounted to the wall behind my computer (for FTP server) and stuff such as that. But if it has a lot of wires, they should be well maintained. Think of the room as having sharp edges. Contemporary. 
* Money is not an issue.

So, any thoughts or advice would be fantastic. Thanks for reading all of this!

1374102304.0	1iiqge	Reddit Interior Design Contest - Win a 200$ IKEA coupon	IFailAtArt	23	5	37	"**Introduction**

Long time lurker, first time poster. I enjoy nice interior design but totally suck at actually designing something myself. That's where you, talented people of reddit, come in ;-)

**The Contest: Decorate my flat and win a 200$ IKEA coupon (or equivalent in your country)!**

All entries are appreciated and have an equal chance of winning: from simple hand-drawn sketches to 3D renderings.

[I've uploaded photos, a layout and even a 3D Google-sketchup.](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8mr2Y3MS0dgckhMYktWNzVRQ1U&amp;usp=sharing)

Submission deadline: **over**

Please pm me your entries.

Once the deadline is over I'll publish all the entries and choose a winner, award her/him a 200$ IKEA coupon (or a coupon of equivalent value outside the US, or a comparable award of equal monetary value if the winner doesn't have access to IKEA)

(Disclaimer: I withhold the right not to anounce a winner if I don't like any of the designs. In that case I'll award a 25$ IKEA coupon (or equivalent) to the entry with the highest upvotes)

**Constraints**

* Must use a 200cm x 140cm bed.
* Must not cost more than 3,000$

**Preferences**

What I need:

* Bed
* Wardrobe (or alternative clothes storage)
* Desk
* Chair
* Book shelf

(These are the essential things that I need - the rest is up to you ;-) )

What I like:

* Minimalistic and clean designs that only contain what you actually need. With a lot of empty space that allows the room to 'breathe' ([example1](http://imgur.com/svuSC), [example2](http://i.imgur.com/NPeNpPp.jpg), [example3](http://imgur.com/a/HJFnw))
* Wooden materials: I think they are natural and timeless
* I love technology, gaming and techno music
* Traditional and masculine values - would fancy to have a flat that shouts: bachelor pad/man cave

Personally though, zippidee's design appealed the most to me: I liked the overall simplicity, the modest furniture and especially the very gentle mix of orange and blue-gray.

Storage issues aside in this room (that's something that I knew I was going to have to deal with), I just don't know how to arrange it!  The way I have it now, the chair is almost unusable, the bed is just an afterthought, and the desk is pretty inaccessible because of the bookshelf that is right behind it.

They didn't. I'm just as clueless as before.

Feel free to ask any questions.

The door you see is the entrance. There are two more similar windows to the right of the fireplace. Also, it's a rectangular room.

I haven't bought any furniture yet because I'm unsure of what colors to get. I was thinking of a brownish couch to go with the carpet, but what other colors could work? I plan on painting the walls a different color. Whatever goes with the couches and carpet.

I want to mount my TV over the fireplace where that clock thing is. I was thinking of floating the couch away from the left wall, closer to the fireplace, to create some kind of a flow when walking inside.

So I'm a teenager about to leave for college, and my mom and I would like to turn my room into a more guest-friendly, ""adult"" room. I just gave away a lot of stuff, so it looks a bit bare at the moment.

(Ignore the random boxes/suitcases on my floor and frames on my desk- all part of the moving out process, haha)

Would love suggestions on to how to make it look a little more modern/impressive, while still leaving enough of my ""touches"" around so that it still feels like my room, as it will be during breaks and such.

Some ideas I've had thus far: 

* adding a few solid color throw pillows to my bed
* re-doing my bulletin boards and painting the corkboard behind them black
* adding some art such as [this](http://thenewdomestic.com/2010/03/weekend-art-project/) to the room- not sure where though! (suggestions appreciated)

Not looking to spend too much money- hopefully just rearranging the things I already have, for the most part. I've already done some of that to my bookcases, and I think they do look a lot more adult-ish, whatever that is.

Any suggestions appreciated!"	t5_2ux9b	True

1372798129.0	1hisie	College student just moved into first apartment, need some ideas	SCE-2-AUX	14	3	2	"Just finished moving in this past weekend and I'm pretty well unpacked at this point. Still need some ideas though, specifically what to put on the walls and a couple pieces of furniture.

My budget is about $300 for decorative stuff, $200 for a dresser, $75 for a bookshelf and $50 for a coffee table if I end up getting one. I can be a bit flexible, but less expensive is better.

I cannot paint the apartment (I've asked), but they're fine with me nailing/screwing things into the walls, so long as they can fix it with some spackle when I move out. I'm a fan of modern decor, but I realize that it may not be possible to give my place a 'style' with the lack of painting options and the somewhat mismatched furniture I currently have. Really I'd just like to have my place feel like home and not some college place with girly posters and beer signs on the wall.

**Living Room**:

As you walk into the apartment, [the kitchen is to your left](http://i.imgur.com/Cs577R1.jpg) and is separated from the living room by a counter. The living room is 12' x 12 1/2' and [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/9VgCJPU.jpg). Now that I've moved my stuff in though, [here is what the current setup is](http://imgur.com/a/2wp7Y). I'm probably going to be using the opposite side of the counter as a breakfast bar just so I don't have to worry about a table or anything. I'm thinking about putting a coffee table in between the couch and my desk, but i'm not sure there is enough space. There's 6 feet of space between the two when my chair isn't at my desk, and 3-4 feet when my chair is there.

[This is my desk right now](http://i.imgur.com/D4p4zvh.jpg) and I'm thinking about mounting my TV on the wall, just above the height of the monitor. Mounting it centered above the desk puts it even with the right side of the couch, and mounting it centered across from the couch puts it about where it is right now.

Next to the desk, I'd like to put a bookshelf, but right now it's where I'm putting the [boxes filled with books](http://i.imgur.com/vDN9yLG.jpg). I could use the shelving on the opposite side of the kitchen counter, but they aren't very deep and it'd be a bit awkward with the chairs there. Right now I'm looking at [this bookshelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10196431/#/10103088) from Ikea for $70, but I'm open to suggestions.

**Bedroom**:

My bedroom is pretty basic right now, with only my bed in it so I'll just [post the pictures without much description](http://imgur.com/a/L56tc). I need a dresser though and am thinking about either putting it directly opposite my bed, directly ahead of you as you walk in the door and where the mini-bookshelf/TV stand is in the fifth picture, or putting it in the closet. I'm open to alternate clothing storage suggestions though.

I'm looking at a couple dressers from Ikea, either [this one](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60239268/) for $250 or [this one](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90252748/) for $130.

**Miscellaneous**:

Right now I've got this [mini-bookshelf/tv stand](http://i.imgur.com/slgiqPO.jpg) that I don't know what to do with. The only place for it at the moment is at the foot of my bed where I'm planning on putting my dresser once I get it. I could use it as a bookshelf, but it's too small for all of my books. I have a small flatscreen to put on it, but I don't really have anything to hook up to the TV to make it useful. I'm thinking about just putting it on Craigslist, but if someone here has an idea of how I could use it, that'd be great.

At the moment, I only have two things to put on the walls. A [picture of my dad and I](http://i.imgur.com/mr5h3Gf.jpg) at a baseball game with some framed memorabilia from the game, and [a signed poster that I got from astronaut John Glenn](http://i.imgur.com/QXNwYmL.jpg) when I was 8. Neither are really consistant with any style, but I'd like to put both of them up because they both have some pretty good memories associated with them.

Thanks so much for your help and suggestions in advance!

I recently moved across the country, and went from a 730 sq ft apartment to one I estimate to be about 300 total sq ft, with the living area alone being about 220 sq ft (about 12x18). My existing stuff (some of which I'll have to jettison immediately upon arrival since I don't think it's going to all fit in here) is going to be 3 weeks late, so I've been living out of my suit case and sleeping bag lol (please excuse the mess in the pictures). I figure now might as well be a good time to get some ideas.

Here's a panorama of it: http://min.us/l8Ji57vYVQhPv
The entrance and kitchen can be seen on the far right. 
Kitchen: http://min.us/lQNEtusZKXBi5
The fridge is stainless steel for those wondering. 

As you enter the apartment, there's exposed brick on your left with an unusable fireplace. 

The rest of the walls are freshly painted white (of course). I'm not really willing to paint the walls for an apartment, but I am open to stenciling.  However, I already have a big colorful painting that I'll probably put on the back wall.

Couple more views: http://min.us/lkjRKeDW0CRtB
http://onethread.minus.com/lbxuy6zv3LOQfj

While I enjoy and appreciate many styles, I took the stylefinder in the sidebar just for kicks and it says I'm transitional. Which is probably accurate. I like contemporary, but cozy. I was thinking of going towards blue or green tones, but I'm not sure how that would react with the red brick. Also, I'm not sure if I should factor in the kitchen design (which is fixed). 

Restrictions and mobilities: I have an off white couch that I'm not willing to get rid of (While it's not the style I envisioned myself getting, I got a good deal for it!) See here: http://min.us/lbqafKvlNiI0yO You can also see the painting there. Also, for the record, that is not me, and I am a dude.

I haven't decided if I'll get a tv, but if I do, it will probably be centrally mounted above the fireplace. In that case, the couch would face it, which would likely force my bed to be by the window. 

I'm probably going to jettison my birch Ikea desk because it's too large. I'll probably jettison my birch malm bed shortly after because I think I should get a frame that has storage space below it since I'm definitely in need of it. That leaves me with an ikea birch expedit bookshelf in terms of furniture.

My landlord requires that I get a rug. 

My motif at my original apartment was reds and browns, so I'm kind of looking for something different; however, I never really put the designer treatment back then, so I'm sure with your guys' advice, reds and browns would end up looking fresh anyway."	t5_2ux9b	True

I'm about to move into my first real appartment and realy could use some help from you awesome people!

Im a 24year old single Dutch Dude who's looking at you great people to help me design my first home!

Let's get started!

The floorplan: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/vx8YA)

Some pictures: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ZaKMN), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rM37e), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sfLEQ), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nSWlD), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/V5iyf)

As you see it isnt much but it's (almost) home.

I realy like the big windows and the long layout of the room.

The bedroom is about the size of Anne Franks room, not much. So only room for a bed.

The Bathroom is simple, and since I rent the appartment, I cant change anything.

SO my question is, what do I do with the rest?!

These are 3 quick layouts that I just made.

1; [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qI0zb)

2;[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/up7K3)

3;[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/06jwH)



As you can see on the pictures, next to the windows are 2 rather big radiators. 
I dont realy know how I should put the sofa and what kind of sofa I should buy. I realy like the L-shaped sofa's due to my lenght and I would love to look out of the window from my sofa, but the radiators taking up quite some space.

Since the bedroom is so small, there isnt any space for a clothing wardrobe. This has to be placed in the main room.
I put it on the left side of the wall.

Looks and colour wise:
I'm realy a fan of the industrial/bachelorpad style. Old warehouses with brick walls, wooden bars in the ceiling, stuff like this:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/O179v), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ywAri), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4dzbJ), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/E6OSs), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rZzEm), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6HZwv)

But since Im living in the real world and not in a massive Manhatan appartment with brick walls and massive rooms I need some good idea's to get that fibe going.

Colour wise I like Grey, not the 50shadesof, but just the colour.
I find it very difficult how to paint the room since its a long, narrow room with quite long walls. Im affraid if I paint it all in the same colour it becomes to dark.

Colour idea's: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/uW8Pf), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/jdc4E), [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LeiWO)

As you can see the floor and the kitchen aren't realy matching the whole grey fibe, so how can I use that wooden fibe mixing nicely with mr.Grey?

I also was thinking about applying a wallsticker somewhere to break the grey but other idea's are realy welcome!

Wallsticker1:[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ihBUI)

Wallsticker2:[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ig5mQ)

Like I said, I have no idea how to place everything so feel free to come up with a whole different lay out that while blow my freakn mind!!


Thanks for spending some time reading this and thanks in advance for any idea you wish to share with me!


Cheers!

**I am looking for advice in rearranging the furniture for the most part, and cheap ways of improving a room. I'm not looking to spend more than around $200-250 in the near future.**

You'll see the difference in styles when you look at the common room verses my bedroom. I think we did a good job of combining our tastes, but it's still not coming together perfectly.
     
Unfortunately the walls are kind of a drab color, and it's a rental so I can't paint them. I would love to have some amazing oversized wall art, especially for the living room, but it's just too expensive.
     

The living room feels a little fragmented. We each contributed different pieces, and because of that I feel like they don't really come together well. I'm not sure how to make the coffee table, entertainment stand, and bookcase go together with the room. No idea what to do with the red ottoman. I bought the trunk as a coffee table but the size is awkward, so I just put it by the door and threw some pillows on it. The living room is also very drab to me, it needs more light and color. The couch especially needs some color, and I would love to add colorful throw pillows, but the back of the couch is pillows rather than cushions so that makes it difficult.
  
The dining room comes together alright but it's a little empty and unfinished looking. Curtains would do wonders I think, if I could find ones I like for the room. I wish I could paint it!
  
My bedroom is unfinished. Haven't had enough money to get good bedroom furniture, so I've been using random garage sale furniture. I want to cover the wall opposite my bed in a poster/print collage. I already have the prints and just need to frame them. But the room still looks kind of cheap/unfinished.
  
I am also planning on renting the house out short term on airbnb while I'm out of town, so any tips to that effect would be helpful as well."	t5_2ux9b	True

My sister is moving out of the house to live with her husband, so my mother wants to do something with her room. Her general idea is to make it into her study. I think she wants more of a lounge or reading room rather than a working study. However my mother is in the beginnings of a new landscaping business so maybe a computer desk is in order or maybe even a drafting table? Stylewise my mother likes traditional styles but not over the top, so traditional contemporary (does that make sense?).

	Stylefinder said: Your style is Romantic
Elegant yet relaxing. Luxurious fabrics, soft colors, fresh florals. Appeals to all the senses and sets a warm mood. My home has Romantic style.




The Room will be completely empty, bare walls, floor molding will likely be replaced. Wood floor will remain. We have no existing furniture to put into this room.

We were thinking a window seat would make the room. I drew something up on sketchup, It may not look like it but its very preliminary. We think it looks too heavy, I rotated the shelves inward to lighten it up, but i feel the top is still too heavy. The 28”x12” tumor in the corner of the room is a real problem, its an exterior wall so it can’t be fixed. Drew up a small fold out desk thingy and some shallow shelves, again very preliminary. Open to better ideas.

The Hallway door leads out into the rest of the house, so this is the primary door. The bathroom door leads into a shared bathroom with another bedroom.

Closet will be empty and we don’t really need the storage its a little over 2’ deep and probably 6’ something wide. Maybe remove the door and do something else with that space? I was thinking about doing the built-in seat thing over there, but maybe its nicer by the window.

Shelving wise, we built some nice shelves in another room so we don’t have a lot of nice things to be displayed on shelves.

Bottom line is this room has been a bedroom for so long, were unsure how to arrange or what furniture to get for it. We need some fresh eyes and perspectives. Or more likely the room isn’t worth a damn.

1362339381.0	19l9fd	Expanding my little bedroom!	Reddict262	11	1	1	"Hi all,

I've just signed on for another year with this tiny bedroom and I'd really like to maximize the space, both in terms of feel and efficiency.  

I was thinking of getting some curtains and maybe painting an accent wall but I really don't know much about interior design.  Also, its definitely time for a comforter.

Maybe a coat-rack to keep my jackets off my bed/chairs/desk, keep running gear off the floor, and a backpack off my spindly white desk chair?

Also, it'd be nice to make better use of that closet... it's 3'x4'.

Thanks for your thoughts!  I appreciate any input as I'm clearly clueless.

PS I'm not worried about money... I'll probably be in this room for a few years.

The apartment has kind of an old look but I find it cozy and reasonable spacious for the rent I pay. Anyway.

Also, I may receive people to sleep so I am thinking on a sofa-bed. The bedroom is easy, I just need a bed and lamp (the bedroom doesnt have a ceiling light, so I have to get light from somewhere). The 'dining' area may be one of those that grow as needed (like expandable table) because I may have people around to play board games or other stuff. My big doubt is where to put an 'office'.

One large issue remains. The main wall has a large window. It lets in lots of great light, but due to the design of the space, it is nearly impossible to cover. The window itself is 11' wide and 5'3"" high. There is a space about 1'7"" wide to either side of the window. An 11' curtain rod is hard enough, but the biggest problem is that there is 1 inch between the window and the ceiling. This section of window frame is metal. The ceiling above is drywall on metal (no drilling). Is there any way I can manage to hang curtains from this metal mess?

1347633445.0	zvm36	Tabula rasa - help a Redditor design a small, simple, tranquil bedroom from the ground up (xpost from r/InteriorDesign)	kevinpuj	12	2	5	"Broadly followed the [guidelines to asking for help in the sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/uqqd7/guidelines_for_asking_for_help/)

1) LAYOUT  The room is a bedroom in a 3-bedroom shared Chicago apartment and is relatively small: 10 1/2 feet by 8 1/2 feet.  Sketchy layout [here](http://i.imgur.com/gZf6t.jpg).  [View from the door](http://i.imgur.com/NMSwE.jpg) and [view from the corner](http://i.imgur.com/VBgTJ.jpg) of the room looking back toward the door.

**Three features to work around,** otherwise a relatively blank slate:
- A light fixture on the ceiling, which can be seen in the top of [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/NMSwE.jpg)
- A street light close to the window on the longer wall, which might make me want to put up some sturdier drapes or blinds.
- A bed will go in there, obviously.  I understand the space is a bit constricted for a bed.  I'd prefer a queen or full size bed.  **I could use some help with advice on whether a queen would fit.**

2) USE OF SPACE I'll be using the space mostly to sleep and to retreat from the world a bit.  A desk would be a strongly desirable but not necessary feature -- perhaps a smaller stand-up desk or a multi-use piece that I could set my laptop on and sit at.

3) FEELING/STYLE I want the room to be **simple, clean, and tranquil.**  I prefer designs described as ""crisp"" or ""serene"" to ornate.  I'm open to painting (though I need to check with roommates/landlord).  Even after reading the guides in the sidebar, I don't know exactly how to describe the colors I think of, just that I would stay away from more neon and very bright colors.

**""Minimalist""** is a tricky word but I think it's in the general direction of what I like.

I don't know if ""continuity"" of rooms is important, but I've taken some pictures of the common area so you can see the style of the apartment [here](http://i.imgur.com/FSEgw.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/Zz7nr.jpg).

To translate this to my personal style, I'm more likely to wear jeans that fit well with a v-neck of a nice color than a very colorful patterned and striped outfit.

I am early 20s, male, single, straight, like hiking, reading, the Green Bay Packers, and more.  I work in consulting.  Two pictures of me active in two different realms: [pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/dev9A.jpg) and [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/mvog9.jpg)

4) BUDGET My budget is flexible.  I think $2000 is a good start, and I'm willing/have time over the next two weeks to DIY, though I don't have much experience.

5) LIST OF ITEMS/FEATURES -- a bed is necessary, some sort of desk and dresser/shelves are pretty essential.

-I will be moving to my first apartment after 5 years of taking care of my mother who suffered kidney failure (all well now - she received a transplant) and raising my younger siblings. It will feel awesome to have a place of my own and to focus on myself and my dreams. 

-It's a 1 bedroom apartment that's 715 sq ft. I have a general idea and color scheme that I would like to stick to (gray, yellow, and navy) for the living area (living, dining, and kitchen); like most apartments it has standard white walls and a neutral carpet. check out my pics here: http://imgur.com/a/FkiBm#0

I have included the floor plan, 3 different pictures (different angles) of the living area, and the basic items that I am interested in buying. All accessories and decorative items will be purchased after I've lived in it for a few weeks. 

-I'm sort of stumped when it comes to the dining area, choosing curtains, and light fixtures. Preferably, I would like to replace the vertical blinds with curtains, replace the fixture in the dining area, and paint a few walls if I am allowed to by the management. If painting is not allowed I would like to cover an accent wall or 2 in removable (temporary) wallpaper or fabric (adhered with liquid starch).

When people find this out about me, one of the first questions is always *""But what do you arrange your furniture around?""*

Well previously, I didn't have an answer for that. I just had awkwardly set up, barren living spaces, and counted on the fact that when my friends came over, we'd get drunk and play games and it wouldn't matter. That worked for a while.

But now that I'm a grown adult, I'm more concerned about being able to host people who aren't going to be black out drunk. Dinner parties and such. My questions are: 

* What are some unique ideas for ways to arrange a TV-less living room when you plan on hosting friends? 
* What are some good focal points I can use in lieu of the boob tube?

I like it the furniture a lot but I feel like it's missing something. I'd say that I like masculine rooms. I wouldn't mind a new desk or painting the one I have. Here is an album of a few rooms I found that I liked. I like the idea of not having the normal ""softer tan"" paint even if I only paint one of the four walls. The new room will definitely need better wall art. I will probably get a piece like this, if not this exact one:

We want to do a two-tone color on the cabinets, like [this] (http://courcydesign.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/decorpad.jpg?w=600&amp;h=450), and are having dark hardwood floors installed prior to moving in.

We're at a total loss as to what to do with the counter tops. The Rustoleum Transformation kits only come in a few colors and we aren't sure how they'd look with white/gray/dark floors. We're wanting to do just a refinish for now and eventually do a counter,  back splash, and sink replacement. The appliances are staying for now, but will be replaced as we can afford them - we'll be doing stainless.

We definitely have our work cut out for us - the whole house is like this. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! "	t5_2ux9b	True

I want to change de bed too, this bed can be moved to anywhere, not attached to the rest of the wardrobe, and i was thinking about a bigger one, like a double bed, but im afraid to just kill the room with that.

The window blind was just for three months, and it just stayed forever, it annoys me so much (and its white and gets dirty easily).

Any more tips, like the monitor and the television position, or the photos;posters (i dont like them this much), whatever, any solution that makes my room look less messy even if its organized.

my husband has owned the house for several years, but rented it out.  the renters caused a lot of damage to the house, and it's very overwhelming to think of the projects we have ahead of us.  one of them is:  **how the hell do we design the living room/dining room?**

there is a fireplace that juts out from the wall, and limits interior decorating potential.   we're working on a limited budget, and removing the fireplace is not an option at this time.  we moved in here less than a year ago, when i was having a difficult pregnancy, and then the baby came, and with all of the transition, we're finally at a point where we really need to get going on making our house a home!


we are going to paint (husband gathering some quotes this week.)  we're going to use some of our savings for new carpet/laminate/tile throughout the house, probably in the next month.


how would you place the furniture?  any ideas on utilizing the odd amount of space in the middle of the room?  would you keep the blinds, or remove them?

For the desk, I already took care of that: a simple wooden top with some hairpin legs. 

For the windows, I have no clue what to do, especially with the long high ones over the desk and computer.

My biggest challenge is the massive fireplace/mantle. The pictures I have hanging now are fine, but not perfect. And the void of the empty fireplace needs to be filled with something. I played around with the idea of plants or a statue but cant settle on one thing.

McGuffey	14	3	6	"Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/11mxkx/before_and_after_pictures/), I thought I'd do some before and after pics of a space [I just finished last weekend](http://imgur.com/a/zU5Tv).  It's actually taken a few years to get to this point, and I'm still working on this space.

What you should know:

1. It's an old house, and unusually shaped.  It was hand built by the original owner in the 40's, and it doesn't fall into any of the usual categories of Craftsman or Bungalow.

2.  This space is still in flux...it needs to be completely redone from ceiling to floor, including windows, which is why I decided to begin furnishing it before remodeling (cheaper).  Everything, decor, rug, furniture, is in flux, so *anything* can change and probably will!

I'm not looking for critique, but if you have any lightning bolts of ideas pass them along!  Mostly, I wanted to share a space in transition, with some before and after pics.

It feels homey, but not completely. I can only use small nails and thumbtacks as I'm leasing the apartment, and I can only paint a color that can be painted over white when I move out, as the landlord will charge extra if they need a second coat.  

Ideas I've had:

* A tan or biege strip from the ceiling to a few inches underneath the top of the closet, all the way around the room.
* A new lamp for the nightstand
* More art (working on getting some pictures printed and framed)
* Moving the Never Forget poster to above my head on the bed, so next to the window
* Mounting the mirror on the wall, as opposed to resting on the small set of drawers with my boxers and socks

A couple things I know already:

* need a frame for the painting 
* new lamp. I really need black or wood speakers (I might DIY some speakers a la /r/diyaudio , I am pretty decent at woodworking)
* rug is too small, but damn bigger rugs than that are expensive
* disregard industrial fan

I have a third floor view of a lovely brick clocktower next door, a hill with trees, and a 7-11 / traffic light combo!

I did try to tie all the colors together, so the pillows match the painting/lamp/candle/plant pot [that isn't there]/green chairs, the rug is the same shade as the cloth in the wicker lamps, and so forth. the furniture is espresso, not quite solid black. Oh and by no fault of my own the grey curtains match the radiator.

TabbyCaterpillar	9	2	24	"I'm in the final stages of buying my first house. I'm using the 203k FHA loan and having some renovations done. I'm working closely with a contractor who will be doing all of the work, but we have only discussed general ideas so far. Once we close on the house, we'll really start the intensive planning. I've come to you guys for your advice and suggestions in the meantime so that I am very prepared when we start.

The house has large, neutral-colored ceramic tiles throughout the first floor (living/dining room and kitchen) and the second floor hallway. The bedrooms are all carpeted. I think eventually I will want to replace the tiles with hardwood, but for now I'm working with the tile. **Opinions on ceramic tile throughout the house? Pros/cons? Would you replace with hardwood?**

Part of the renovations will be a completely new kitchen, and they will have to take the tiles out of half or all of the kitchen and put new flooring in. I'm considering hardwood flooring instead of trying to find a tile that complements the tiles already there. **New ceramic tiles in the kitchen or hardwood?**

I'm also having a new full bath put in, location not yet confirmed. I'd like it to go in the living room (as I drew it in the room planner below) but it will block off the only window on that whole side of the room. Other options we've discussed are putting it completely in the kitchen, and splitting it between the two rooms (taking the wall down) and leaving a small nook for the living room window to stay in that room. **Looking at the drawings and photos below, where do you think the bathroom should go?**

Once structural stuff is determined, I'll need to actually furnish and decorate the place. I put furniture in the room planner just to see how things will fit. The furniture in there is all just generic, so what I end up finding will vary. I'd love to hear your ideas for decorating the place, though.

Color ideas (I'm liking the yellow and grey trend. Basically it's going to be grey, black, white, and COLOR OF YOUR CHOOSING). Where do you put the accent colors? Pillows, furniture, what's the deal?

What do you put on the WALLS?!

I don't want to spend over $100. You can give me your favorite high-end, glamorous opinions but if I can't DIY it, it probably won't happen.

There is a ceiling light I didn't get a picture of. I want to make a hanging light like this:

The walls are like painted-over panneling or something. The widths of the panels are different. Could I do something like this, or does it looks sloppy if they're different sizes:

I just finished spray-painting the frame from this junk shop $1 painting. To give you all an idea of what sort of craftiness and thriftiness I'm interested in. If I go with a yellow color, I'll hang this up.

**Here's the basic idea of what I would ideally have:**

-A room where I can sleep comfortably, as well as work and study.

-Ive always wanted a matching color scheme, just a good looking room.

-Something awesome, I don't know, I just realized my room sucks because I don't really have any ideas of how to make it better so it's hard to say what I want &lt;_&lt;.....

**Here's some problems I always have:**

-I always feel claustrophobic in there! Don't know if it's the color scheme or the layout or the junk, but it's hard to relax. 

-I got rid of my dresser, thinking that would save space, but now I just have tons of clothes in my closet all over the place.

-I don't have anywhere to put my big art drawing pads and supplies. They're big so I can only put them on the floor and lean them against the wall. It looks horrible.

I'm on a budget as well. I wouldn't mind getting some reading material on the subject that would best help me, if anyone has any recommendations.

The biggest problem is the stairs, they create so many walls. Big walls, little walls, we can't figure out any of it. Should we run the family room color around that wall behind the closet (past the clock on the wall and over the ledge) to the big wall that runs down to the basement, or start a new, more neutral color that will transition to the basement. And then how to handle the smaller, angled sections that make up the walls under the stairs is odd too. Would the section that comes down from the ceiling normally be painted white like a ceiling or colored like the wall?

This wall is opposite the three large windows in the bay window. Could this be painted a shade or two darker than the rest of the room as it gets a ton of light from those windows. (cat shadow on the wall, because Reddit)

Looking for help in the layout of [this tiny apartment](http://imgur.com/RAejC). (The grey space in the middle is where I cut out the apartment number, that's all) I have not moved in yet, and the landlord hasn't provided me with measurements, but I'm just looking for a basic idea of where to place things in the main living area. 

As you can see, it's basically one room (besides the bedroom and bathroom) with the kitchen against one wall, and windows along a corner, which gives the place lots of natural light, even though it's small.

The king size bed is going either against the wall to the left, or against the wall that is all windows. I haven't decided yet, and I think I'll just have to see. I was thinking if it went along the window-wall, I could put a large bookshelf (if there's room) along the far-left wall of the bedroom. There's also minimal closet space, so I'm going to need a dresser for sure. (In previous apartments, I just used closet-hanging cubes, but I don't think that will work here)

I have one piece of furniture that I really like, a mid-century record console - [this is really close](http://vintageground.blogspot.com/2011/08/mid-century-modern-record-console.html) - that I bought as a birthday present years ago for myself, and would like to highlight, as I actually use it to listen to records, and often plug my computer into it as I like the sound quality.

Other wise, I need to get:

* a couch (was thinking a futon - is this a big no-no? I need somewhere for guests to stay, and sleeper sofas are from the devil and impossible to move);

* bookshelves (I have lots of books - was thinking of using bookshelves as bedside-tables to double up);

* and possibly a dining area something-or-other to eat at (although space is so tight, I'm not sure how to do that)

* I also need to store my bike somewhere, and was thinking of hanging it somewhere on a wall - [like this](http://manmadediy.com/users/chris/posts/1955-how-to-make-a-diy-wall-mounted-bike-hanger-from-drop-handlebars).

I have lots of nice stuff I like to hang on the walls, so it will mostly be an issue of where I can fit everything in that sense; I mostly need help on where to place stuff! I'd like to take advantage of the lots of light that comes in, and was thinking of putting the couch under the windows, but then would I put the ""dining area"" against the wall with no windows? I like walking into a welcoming space, so I feel like whatever is against the wall on the other side of the bathroom (the entrance door is right next to the kitchen, although there is a closet and tiny hallway there).

 * Projector for tv?
 * Trying to put a small table next to the counter for more eating space maybe match the height and use stools for the table?
 * I like plants and have been known to keep them alive the only plant I have right now is a 4yr Hoya

&gt;i am a student (21), and live with my family (love them).
&gt;My room is a constant mess for years now, and i always planned to clean it properly, and rearrange it nicely. When i found this subreddit, i knew i could find the motivation for it, started browsing and got some good ideas, so i started planning as well.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/bamf8)'s an album of my bedroom .(Floorplan included - i hope it's good enough, it should be scaled correctly)

I dont know how to rearrange the furniture. I'm really bored of the current setup, and also find it not too practical.    
Feel free to suggest me what to move where. (:    
What i think would be good to start with is to move the desk in front of the windows - ""Mehr licht!"" :). (i added two plans to the album too, but somehow i'm not satisfied with any ot those (also, the sofa isnt there on them).)

**Plans**:

* find a good place for the sofa
* ""break up"" the emptiness in the middle of the room
* fix some cheap and colorful curtains on the non-book shelves (patchwork maybe?)
* buy and start a small aquarium (place not yet decided for it)
* fix the holes on the wall
* paint some narrow-ish stripes on the wall ([source of idea](http://www.sasinteriors.net/2012/02/diy-how-to-paint-stripes-and-product-review-of-u-stripe-it/))
* make a small gallery wall
* find ideas for some more DIY extras which could make me feel the room more home and mine

***
*Some additional info*:

* the wall with the many wardrobes is the ""cold wall"", linking to the garden, so some wardrobes would be best kept in front of that wall as some thermal insulation.
* the holes in the walls were for ugly shelves disassembled long ago
* I don't use the TV, and like to use the piano-chair as a nighttable if i'm watching a movie on my laptop.
* My budget is very low, so mostly would like to stick to rearranging, and minimal additions.
* I live in Budapest (Hungary)
* I rather keep to myself in the room, when friends are over we usually use the living room
* My girlfriend's dad has a carpenters' store, my uncle is handy with electricity, and i like doing DIY

***
I'm grateful, and eager to hear any remarks and ideas! Have a nice day!

**EDIT**:    
Here's the floorplan i'm going with atm:
http://imgur.com/vWGAc

* i moved the glass-doored cabinet to my brothers' room, and moved in a big wardrobe (like the bigger one in the line). i put the 2 bigger ones to the corner, and the lower, TV-one next to it, 1 bookcase stays in the line.
* i thought i'd like a more central place for my aquarium (i ordered an [Aquael shrimp set](http://www.aquael.pl/images/stories/0Akwarium/Zestawy_akwariowe/shrimp.jpg), it will ship this week hopefully), so i moved the TV into one of the bigger wardrobes, and the aquarium will take its old place
* i made up my mind on getting rid of the cloth hanger, and will apply a rod into the narrower wardrobe, which is now on the left side from the door if you enter (and i'll use some kind of vertical cloth hanger / hooks if the place won't be enough)
* the piano will stay in the corner, in the angle (or maybe will move a bit closer to the wall, as with the new wardrobe-settings there are some extra space, but still in an angle, not paralell)
* i moved the poang chair to my parents' room, my dad's armchair is quite old, and he uses it often to watch tv / read, i'll might keep the old armchair in my room
* i'll paint the stripes on the bed's wall, and til the window (in an L shape, marked with an orange line in the pic) - i think i'll use light orangeish-yellow/light reddish-crimson/light peach-ish colors, with white interception lines.
* above the sofa will be my gallery wall, i'm collecting ideas for it (the guides in the sidebar come in handy) :)
* i also would like some more art above the piano, i'm checking out art prints ([Soceity6](http://society6.com/prints) &lt;- here), and i like some very much, but looks too expensive for me (print+shipping=$$$) - **any ideas where can i find some nice HD print pictures that i can have printed?** (i like the minimalist-stencil-popartsy pics, i think they would suit the room, but all i have are some HD wallpapers - are they good enough to print in bigger size (let's say 40x60cm)?)

After removing the wardrobes from the wall, i treated the mold in the upper and lower corners (the whole house still smells of chlorine). I also filled the holes with plaster.   
By removing all stuff and back, i sort my things through and out, and i'm getting more space = good. However, i'll need to organize my space better, so i think i'll need some paperboard boxes (low-budget) on the shelves.

The room is still a big mess, the [sofa-corner is almost done](http://i.imgur.com/HUL3g.jpg), the painting is the next on my checklist. (:

1348252580.0	109dtd	Awesome new Chicago apartment, no furniture.  Help me design my living room.  W/pics.	PowerLord	9	2	7	"Hi all, I just got a brand new apartment in Chicago.  You can see from the pics what its like, although they don't really do it justice - i'd guess the ceilings are at about 10 or 11 feet.  I'm six feet tall and I can't reach within a foot of the top of the windows without jumping.  The room is MUCH larger than it appears in the pictures.

Some other relevant info:  

-I'm shooting for a more modern/asian look, slightly minimalist even perhaps.  I hate clutter, and giant fat overstuffed couches.  

-I don't have a huge budget, but i could spend a maximum of 3000 dollars over the next month or two, and it seems a lot of furniture stores will give cheap financing right now.  

-I'm willing to paint, but I'd prefer not to.  The current walls are a sort of light beige/cream color.  My preference would be to get some large artwork to take up space.  I was thinking a big Chinese painting might be cool - I can get one next time I go back over for work.

-I may get a large fish tank in a year or so when I'm sure I won't have to move again soon.  I'm not sure what type - maybe saltwater, but a [nature aquarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquascaping) would be my preference if I think I'll have the time to take care of it.

My S.O. and I just signed on our first 1 bedroom apartment together and we really like the space as it fits most of our needs, but now we're struggling to figure out the most effective way to arrange our furniture.  

We bought a new couch and chair this weekend and they are very comfortable and cozy but they obviously take up a lot of valuable space in the living room.  We both have our hobbies and wanted our own space, but a two bedroom was just not in our budget for the area we are in right now.  We still want a space that we can work on stuff, however.  Originally, we planned to arrange the couch, chair and tv the way I've depicted in the picture, and set up some desks along the wall that is shared with the kitchen, but once we got the couch and chair in there it seemed way too cramped.   

The kitchen area has a decent sized space for a table and I was thinking we could set up an area over there.  We need to fit two desks, one that's 32.5 x 18 and one that's 27.5 x 19.5 and probably some space for short bookshelves or other storage.  I would still like to have room for a small dining table or bar table but I don't know if that will be too cramped as well.

I'm just a little overwhelmed with trying to fit so much stuff into this space.  Hopefully somebody can give me some ideas."	t5_2ux9b	True

Youtube video of the apartment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtGhj9UwO0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

My wife and I are moving to Ecuador in September. We secured a fourth story apartment in the center of town for our return. The apartment is a 2bed/2bath with insanely good natural light, there are windows everywhere. We have free reign to make any cosmetic changes we desire. The worst thing about the apartment, in my opinion, is the ugly brown ceramic tile.

We are extremely limited in what we can bring with us from the states... Basically everything has to fit in our luggage, we can't ship anything at this time. That said, it is possible to have basically anything, furniture wise, custom made there. Our friends have what looks like an entire house full of Restoration Hardware furniture that was all made there for a tiny fraction of the price.

My ideas:

* At first, I wanted to cover over the ugly tile with some type of floating floor, but now I am thinking that I would like to embrace the brown and try to tie the whole place together with a cool color scheme. Here are a couple of palettes that I like that include a similar brown http://www.whorange.net/whorange/2012/07/wes-anderson-films-color-palette.html

* I would like hang art ""salon style"" (my wife and I are big fans of the Wes Anderson aesthetic, if that wasn't already obvious)

* I would like the space to have a modern, minimalistic look. Is the brown tile gong to contrast that style?

* Also, we are considering getting a Pillowsac ( http://www.lovesac.com/sacs/pillowsac.html) for the living room, as they compress very small and transport easily. Thoughts?

What I am looking for: EVERYTHING... Any thought on any of this, no matter how small or large would be greatly appreciated!

I have been living in this room for 2 months now.. really need a closet and a solution to my -noroomforadesk- problem.  Sometimes i do work from home in this room at 3 am, and its tough to stay up all night on a nice comfy bed.  I also game, but havent been gaming since i moved in because it is very uncomfortable to sit up for extended periods of time, and the mouse is usually being used at a weird angle.

Bed - got a queen bed with storage.  6 drawers that open.  currently have pushed my bed into a corner and will need to pull it back out to gain access to the 2 drawers on that side.  Which means that the closet and/or the computer solution need to be raised from the floor so i can move the bed around.

Closet- originally wanted a closet with doors, but i believe it may be too inconvenient to have to wrestle with doors in a tiny space and also make the space feel cramped.  I'm not happy with having my clothes in my face all the time, but i would love to hear some ideas  on how to hide them. Looking at at least two hanging clothes poles.  Also an idea was to have the two hanging clothes poles and then have a diagonal one or rounded corner one, that is up top for the long clothes that would be closest to the door.

computer/office space - originally thought having a desk + closet in one area is the only way, but since i bought the bed i do not think there would be space.. so my bed is my desk i think.. but, my monitor is now too far away from me to see small text.
    Desktop measurements: 24"" x 17"" 9.5""  and weights about 45lbs (hella heavy)  
    Moniter is a 23"" right now, but  i am thinking of upgrading to a flat screen and just mounting it on the wall (top wall between pipe and door)  my only problem is not being able to see small text.. since right now i am on my bed leaning against the opposite wall.

Since I'm pretty much redesigning the room anyway, I'm willing to buy art or bedding in any style that would go well with the colors I pick, so there really aren't any limitations, except for the carpet, which is gray. I don't think I'll have the funding to recarpet the room, so that's the only limiting factor.

Hoping to have the bookcases flank the bench/window so that it will enhance the windows so that I may read comfortably.  In fact, my favourite part of the space are the windows and the view they offer.

Just wanted to hear some ideas anyone may have to open up the space until then?  The biggest hurdle is the couch because the back/arms are so high and I feel it's awkwardly shaped for the room.  I'm not set on the furniture either as it's remnants of university life.  Currently the walls are a faint pink/white colour with the bookcases and coffee table being black and the couches brown/tan.

Here is a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/R2iJHJB.jpg) of the sectional and the living room before the windows and walls were painted.  I also quickly planned it [online](https://planner5d.com/gallery/view/?key=69fbb7b0adec63cbd47dbcae134e0d63#.USgesR04t2A).

And I also REALLY want to order a framed print of [this.]( http://society6.com/thePisforpenis/I-Got-Your-Back_Print/). (There are some NSFW illustrations there as well)

This room, will be a living room, dining room(though I may just get 2 stools for the ""bar""), and a play area for my daughter, which I thought about maybe sectioning off with some kind of ceiling mounted curtain.

    I need to get a coffee table, a TV stand thing (I can hang the TV, but I'll need somewhere for my DVD, Wii, etc), maybe a rug, and some misc ""flair""(lamps, decorations, etc).

If you guys could steer me in the right direction, I'd REALLY appreciate it.  Whether its suggestions of actual items, or just some guidelines.

Here's some pictures, and a floorplan.  Excuse the mess, we just moved in, excuse the floorplan, I'm in the process of building a PC.  So I'm using my phone.

I guess I would describe my style as minimal with hints of color, so I don't really like too many frills. I just want a cohesive look with maybe some geometric patterns thrown in if they aren't an eyesore.

Next to my bed is [my cart](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50227973/) where I keep some books and my personal items (phone charger, a couple of DVDs, hair brushes and so on). I don't have a dresser so everything is hung up or folded in my closet. 


I guess I'm looking at ideas on how to arrange my room, what sort of bedsheets and curtains to get and possibly an idea for a storage shelf/unit to store more books.

Long time lurker here but now I need your help.
I've been looking at /r/InteriorDesign and /r/DesignMyRoom for a long time. And the time has come for me to get some advice from you.

Next month I'll be moving to my own place. I've made a floorplan for you [here](http://furnituredealer.planningwiz.com/plankey_35bf98501edec1431e0c2fabe948da66705011101027). 

I never had a place of my own and haven’t got any furniture. I would like your thoughts on how to arrange the room and comment on what I've been thinking about doing.

What I will be bringing from my old place:

• Bed

• 37 inch TV

• PC (22 inch screen)


There is not a lot of space, and I want to make it feel spacy by not filling it with furniture.

I would like to have people over for dinner, but not sure I’ll be able to fit in a desk, small dining table, sofa, coffee table and bed.

Hanging the TV on the wall, I imagine will save some space.

Shopping list - what I have thought about so far:

[Desk](http://www.ikea.com/dk/da/catalog/products/20186648/#/20147355)

[Chair](http://www.casanovafurniture.dk/shop/eames-armstol-daw-849p.html) (wishlist): Haven’t got the money for it, maybe someone knows one that looks like it?

[Ceiling light](http://www.westelm.com/products/industrial-pendant-glass-w682/?pkey=call-lighting): I’ve fallen in love with this lamp, but not sure it is going to work hanging in the middle of the room.

[Wall](http://www.ikea.com/dk/da/catalog/products/30120572/)

I haven’t looked at a sofa, coffee table and dining table because I’m not sure how to arrange it all.

I can’t provide any pictures yet, sorry about that.

1347851680.0	1006i6	Need some ideas for our long living room	Mashiara	8	0	13	"Hey folks. I'm nearing 30 and getting married in April. Fiance and I are looking to start transitioning our living space into something that feels a little more like home and less like a college kid on a budget. We are currently renting, and we have plenty of space. Actually, we have a little too much space (our 2nd bedroom is still full of boxes and it's been a year since we moved in - our dining room has no table and is just a home for our chameleon's enclosure, etc). Anyways, I'm looking to start with the living room.

[Here is our living room](http://imgur.com/a/ulwcR) - please excuse the blurriness, my phone doesn't take pictures well with low light.

The room is quite a bit longer than it is wide, I don't know if the pictures convey it very well. On one side of it, there is a brick wall and setting with a wood burning stove placed on it. It's collecting quite a bit of dust at the moment. The stove is a permanent fixture. The blue couch in the photo is being put out on the curb and the brown couch will probably be replaced within 6 months. We have more books/games/discs than we have storage for. The card table visible in the doorway is not usually out, we only bust it out when people come over.

We don't spend a lot of time in the living room unless we: A. Have company (not often) B. Bought a new console game or C. It's Football season. Our dogs basically own the room (they stay downstairs). There is also a dog hair problem, we clean it up regularly but rugs and such are probably a no go. I'd also like any ideas on keeping hair off the furniture.

So, I appeal to you folks. We'd like to entertain company more frequently and have a nice place to do it. Money isn't too big an issue, and things can be purchased over time. We're pretty huge nerds/geeks, so anything artwork/items like that would be neat, but stuff that would pass as decor without being completely overt is ideal. Sorta like someone coming over and saying, ""I don't know what that is or where it's from but it looks awesome"" kinda stuff. (hard to explain what I mean)

1376360233.0	1k91gu	Please help me design my tiny room!	giveortake7	6	0	7	"I'm moving out for the first time and my room is quite small (~8.5ft x 9ft). I'm trying to get an idea of how to utilize the space in the most efficient way. I realize that I'll have to have the bed up against the wall, which I don't mind too much. In the pictures, the bed is facing towards the door/wall. However, I was thinking that it might look better rotated and facing the closet instead. 

I think a full-size bed might be my best option to avoid overpowering the room. I was also thinking about forgoing the often excessively bulky bed frames for a regular box frame bed (?). I would like to have some kind of headboard though. I've heard about DIY headboards - any suggestions? 

I'm not overly worried about storage as there is a huge wall length closet as well as a closet in the hallway. I don't think a dresser would fit comfortably in the room so I was thinking about getting the storage specifically meant for inside the closet (as shown in the picture). Also, lots of shelves?

So this is what I'm working with:

Problems with my room right now that I know I have to deal with somehow:

- Having a double bed, large dresser, full closet, and lots of random stuff leaves almost no room for study space.
- I'm very easily distracted and as it stands I cannot associate my room with work - I want to change that.
- I would like to remove the shag carpet and replace it with hardwood - would hiring someone to do this be worth it? For what price?
- I'm also interested in repainting.
- I have a study desk from IKEA in mind, it's included in the album.

Can someone give me redesign/furniture suggestions/general renovation advice based on my criteria? All in all I need space to be utilized better and a more mature, study oriented space. &lt;$500 budget hopefully (exluding cost of desk which is $200).

I'm 17 and my dad is willing to help me out to an extent but he doesn't want to hire people to install the floor or paint the walls, would it be worth it for me to convince him to hire people (I can pay out of my pocket up to a few hundred right now if need be)?

The closing date is not scheduled until June 3rd but as that is just around the corner, I'd like to have at least a basic plan in place for how the room is going to be laid out. 


The house will contain me and four other 23-24 year old guys. In our present living situation we all like to loaf around and watch TV, Netflix, Movies, Sports, etc (who doesn't right?). As this is the only feasible common area for such a room in this new house I would like to work out how to make it a media room. 


Picture 1 in the gallery shows the view of this living room area from what is planned to be the dining room. 


Picture 2 shows the view from the table that is currently in the middle of the room. This is the left wall that you cannot really see in picture 1. 

Important things to note. 

- While there is a fireplace, we do not plan on using it and would actually be fine building around it or putting something in front of it. We live in the hot southern part of the US (Atlanta, GA) and don't plan using the fireplace.

- In the far side of picture 1 you can see a doorway that is actually the front entrance of the house. As there is a side driveway with side entrance and garage with garage entrance I do not anticipate us using the front door very often. 

- TV placement has been very hard for me to figure out. It is a long and narrow room with opposing walls being a set of windows and a fireplace. I don't really want to mount the TV above the fireplace as it is hard on the eyes and neck to view at such an extreme angle, and mounting/placing on the windows side seems foolish.

- **TV. We currently have a 55 inch LCD flat panel TV as well as an Epson PowerLite Projector and would be willing to use either as the main TV. The projector may give us flexibility to use a screen either in front of the fireplace or in front of the windows but I would love to hear what sort of creative ideas you all come up with.

Here are some pictures: [room album](http://imgur.com/a/ZR87B/)

I'm looking to paint the walls a yellow color. Anywhere from a [pastel yellow](http://i.imgur.com/lTFkory.jpg) to a [golden yellow](http://i.imgur.com/bB5M8no.jpg). Nothing too obnoxious, since this is my parents' house and they'll have to look at it for years after I move out. 

The carpet is going to be ripped out as well, after painting. I don't know what color is going to go best with the walls, but I know for sure I don't want white. I have two cats. And I've always had a love/hate relationship with anything white; clothes, walls, shoes, etc. 

This is basically the vanity dresser that I have: [Ashley Furniture Bittersweet Dresser and Mirror](http://www.ashleyfurniturehomestore.com/catalog/product.aspx?group=bedroom&amp;category=bedroomdressersmirrors&amp;id=B219B1&amp;spi=0&amp;ref=search-t).

I have the bedside table thing that goes with it. I also have a bookshelf in the same color.

I have cable in my room, and a 32 inch television. Cable can be moved, but it's been in that corner of the room [where the tv is in the pictures] since we moved in. 

Some things about me: I like yellow [I don't know if you could tell, but I **love** yellow]. I like giraffes, cats and bacon. Bright things excite me, and I plan on purchasing some strong lights like these, [not necessarily in blue](http://www.etsy.com/listing/115115758/20-blue-tone-cotton-ball-string-lights?ref=sr_gallery_12&amp;ga_search_query=string+lights&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=all). But something to that effect. 

I guess this whole post is to just bounce some idea off the lovely people in this subreddit. If the yellow is a bad idea, if the layout is a bad idea, etc. Any and all comments are welcomed! I don't really have a budget, but I'm not trying to break the bank either. Somewhere around a $2500 - $3000 budget.

The downside is that I loose the open loft-feeling of the original plans. Also I have to cross a room to get into the bathroom. This room would be a dressing and host a washer/dryer.

I want a bath and a walk-in shower, two sinks (that can be merged into one bigger) and a toilet in there.

I made this post over in /r/interiordesign and would like to get as much input as I can.

I bought a house somewhat recently (scaling up from an apartment) and I have this room that I would really like to pop. However, I can't really think of where to begin. Here are the details:

The ""square"" portion of the room is 10' 9"" long by 10' 3"" wide. The tiny alcove leading to the door is 3' 5"" long by 3' 2"" wide.

I am honestly open to just about anything. I usually end up spending a lot of my time in here as it is where my computer is, although there is no reason it couldn't be used for multiple purposes. As for style, I like the idea of sleek and streamlined/modern mainly. My living room as a black tempered glass coffee table that I really like. So with that in mind, here are my current thoughts.

The desk needs to be replaced. It was an old particleboard type desk that I picked up at a thrift store since the apartment was my first time moving away from home. I was almost thinking some sort of glass corner desk? The curtain needs to go as well.

The current light fixture in the room matches the rest of the ones in the house, and while they look nice, I bet this room could get a lot more light. I always liked the idea of track lighting, I just wouldn't be sure how it would turn out in this room.

I thought about posters/art as well. My job consists of caring for reptiles and it is definitely a passion, but I can't decide if I want reptile pictures hanging all over my walls. If a room were to have them though, this would probably be it.

Budget is pretty open. a max around $1000-1500? Depends where the ideas go! I appreciate your time reading this and look forward to hearing some great ideas!

My boyfriend and I are moving in together and have managed to score a wicked apartment for a wicked price, but we need a bit of guidance in terms of a general 'direction' to go with our main room.  
Here is a floor plan and short video for you to see what we're working with:  
[Floor plan](http://i.imgur.com/3WTvt) (flipped for accuracy)
[Quick, probably unnecessary video of space in question](http://tinypic.com/r/vdngj/6)  
We went to a furniture store yesterday and ordered a [sectional](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-FAB-00221_1408759K.jpg) (in more of a beige, stone color than what's pictured), [dining set](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/BOR-DRF-00005_1409197K.jpg), [coffee table](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-OTB-00206_1398305.jpg), [end table](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-OTB-00193_1391964.jpg), and a [sofa table](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-OTB-00159_1382353.jpg).  
We came home and decided that we didn't really like the pieces as much as we did in the store, so we cancelled everything but the sofa, which we love. We were going in the right 'direction' though, but I think we want more of a rustic/modern minimalistic look...whatever that means. We love the wooden DIY tables seen in [/r/DIY](http://i.imgur.com/G9aqK.jpg?1), as well as [this dining style](http://www.hallofritz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/table02.jpg).  
In terms of layout, we want the 'entertainment area' in one of the window corners of the main room, facing the window..using the sectional to kind of divide between areas. We're planning on installing a floating desk along one of the walls..we're thinking in the 'dining area' on the floor plan, but it's not a solid plan and anything can happen at this point. Anyways I guess we're just looking for suggestions..seeing if anyone has any theme ideas, maybe some end/coffee tables that would match our description, or some help with the layout. Thanks!  
Just as an added bonus, my boyfriend got the 'Spanish Inspired' result from HGTV's Style Finder in the sidebar:

Uker	8	1	16	"Not really sure where I would like to see this room going, but it is quite small (8 feet square) and has 2 walls that are entrances into the kitchen and living room. I also have a window on one side. The current condition of the room can be seen here: http://imgur.com/a/DTW4x . Obviously, the table is too big for the room...but that is a purchase I have already made and can't change. The table dimensions are 42'' x 42'' which leaves about 27'' on each side of the table - can be seen [here](http://www.target.com/p/threshold-upholstered-dining-focal/-/A-14275050#prodSlot=medium_1_51)

To start with some sort of inspiration, I really have no idea. I love this picture http://imgur.com/C57hm but I don't think it's possible with the room as I have no where else to put the print, and the table most likely has to be against a wall. I am on a pretty strict budget - probably around 200$ - 250$ including the purchase of chairs and table linens etc but I would love to see everyone's thoughts on what I could do. The only limiting factor is I can't paint the walls. I was thinking about getting some gray [chairs](http://www.target.com/p/threshold-franklin-dining-chair-salsa-set-of-2/-/A-14226451) from Target but I don't know where to go from there.

1355839836.0	151vgd	No love over at r/interiordesign, perhaps my room is too ugly.	godlesspaladin	12	6	4	"Hey, so here's what's going on. I just moved in with my girlfriend into this old duplex house. She had a roommate living in the room that is now mine, but that roommate moved to the other side of the duplex.  I stay with my girlfriend in the room upstairs, but this new room is now completely open for me to do whatever I want with it. 
It's basically the living room of the house as it is the first room you enter upon entering the house.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/wQQG4) are pictures of the space along with a rough diagram of the layout and dimensions. The old roommate still has a few items in the house that she has to remove and please forgive the mess, I still need to go through and clean up the place. I would like to use the space for entertaining people, but also as my personal get away area. I want to create a warm, classy, and largely open space where we can watch movies or do things around the floor. This is a high traffic area as people need to walk straight across the room from the entrance of the house to get to anywhere else in the house.

Here are my restrictions: 

* I don't have a lot of money. (surprise) I'd like not to spend more that $100-150 on decorating the room. We rent the place and will only be there until May. 

* I don't want to cover the air vents. (They're marked in orange boxes on my diagram) The room also only has 2 power outlets that can't be overloaded. (The house is very old and the frat boys around the corner just burned their house down from an overloaded outlet.)

* I have to use the dresser in the right of [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/zCUaf.png) to store my clothes somewhere in the room. The dresser is about 3 feet wide by two feet deep. (Don't have exact measurements available right this moment.) 

* The only seating I currently have is [this](http://i.imgur.com/uBk4t.jpg) futon. I also still have those two square rice paper floor lamps if they could be of use.

* I would like to somehow incorporate the fireplace. It is currently bricked up, but i was thinking it still might be nice to place a two-three level candle fireplace in front of it. I figured I could layer candles on the levels or something. i was inspired by [this](http://i.imgur.com/u4c0G.jpg)

* I need to set up a computer desk for my desktop and monitor somewhere in the room. I was thinking of getting an old wooden desk/table from a thrift store.

* I have a small projector that I would like to use to project movies on the large wall without windows. I was thinking of getting a large white sheet, like a drop cloth or something, doing the edges like a sail from an old wooden sailing ship, and having that pulled taught across the center of the large open wall via screw eyes and some sisal rope. It wouldn't bee too big as the projector's got shitty 720p max resolution. (Again, I don't have any money to afford anything else and I'd prefer to use the projector rather than a TV and have to get a tv stand.

What I've got in my head so far: I imagine putting the futon directly under the window across from the large windowless wall. (This way we could sit on the futon and watch movies on the opposite wall. I would put the large dresser to the left of the futon. (Left as in if you were sitting on it.) The dresser would fit flush with that little bit of wall that juts out two or so feet into the room. I was thinking of getting my computer desk/table and putting it directly under the other window, so I would be facing out the window. This way I could also link the computer to the projector with a cable.  The rest is wide open. I would like to put something (tapestries?) on the wall next to the sheet I'd use as a screen, but I'm really open to suggestions.

1355766819.0	1503xw	Small update on my potential living room redesign.	SweetknuckleJunction	9	2	3	"[My Original Post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/13gbt2/any_ideastips_for_my_living_room/)

I submitted the above post about a month ago asking for some tips and ideas on how to better use my living room space.

Everyone gave me awesome ideas and asked for an update so I wanted to deliver, even though what we have accomplished so far hasn't been what I hoped for.

--The couches are both 77 inches wide.

That one fact alone, killed my hope for moving them around.  

I wanted to try for an L shape with the couches and while [one would fit on the wall with the DVD shelves](http://i.imgur.com/g6TNj.jpg), but [the second couch](http://i.imgur.com/5MPKc.jpg) would not fit on the back wall, due to the dip (or whatever it's called) on the far left.  

[The wall with the TV](http://i.imgur.com/IzqHu.jpg) nothing would fit on, besides the TV as it is only 55 inches.

So with regard to the couches, how we have it set up now, seems to be the only way they will fit.

What we have decided to do is:

* Get rid of the DVD/bookcase and my boyfriend is going to build shelving in that [dip in the back wall, on the left](http://i.imgur.com/K5SBe.jpg).  He is going to stain it to match the couches and table.  We began the process and cut the wood, but the wall bows out on the bottom, so he has to plane it and re-cut some of the shelves a tiny bit.

* On the wall where the DVD/bookcase is now, we are going to use as a picture wall.  So that will leave it more open.

* Paint the whole room another color.

Any suggestions on paint colors?   The only color I don't want is white.

*
*

We do have a [whole other room](http://i.imgur.com/AyLb7.png), which [we basically do nothing with](http://i.imgur.com/UZW1q.png), that I would LOVE to use as the living room, but BF is against it.

The landlord's bed room is above that room and he doesn't want to make too much noise with the TV and video games that would disturb him, (he goes to bed early because of work).   I totally understand that point, but our TV is never, ever that loud. 

He also hates the carpet due to the fact that when our dog was young, she would use that room as her potty since we were never in it.

As it stands i'm working on convincing him, but i'll probably loose out.

* I plan on getting a new **desk** for my room. I'm not too sure on the shape that I want to get, nor of the style of the desk. I'm thinking of just having a rectangular desk, with a tempered glass top (like the one on the bedside table) and legs of a similar colour to my bed frame. However, by having a desk in front of the window, there is a area of space between the desk and the bedside table which is pretty much useless. I'm not too good at this kind of stuff, so any advice is greatly appreciated. 
* Secondly, I would also like a small **bookshelf** somewhere in my room for my textbooks and other miscellaneous stuff. Not too sure about colour once again. I don't mind rearranging the room. 
* Wall colour (the walls are currently a really light green), other decorations, etc.

I don't really have a budget, just not too over the top.

Any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance guys!

First priority is a sofa and a TV and shelf, since I have all the other absolute essentials. 

I was thinking about getting a kitchen island to use as a high dining table and suspending some lamps over it. I thought about some wood work surfaces on that, so to match the kitchen I would replace the existing crappy black work surfaces in the kitchen with the same wood.

I like natural colours with maybe some dusky teal thrown in (so maybe a dark brown sofa?), and maybe a muted purple for the bedroom? I don't want to go over the top with colour though, maybe have a wall of each and leave the rest white (but which wall?).

I might bin the wardrobes in the bedroom, they seem fairly cheap BUT they're brand new, so any ideas to make them better? I think I could also move them in the bedroom.

I've recently purchased a house and take possession in a little over a month. I really like the house but have an issue with the living room since it has a corner fireplace.

Here's some photos of the space in question: http://imgur.com/a/SDTrP

The dimensions listed on the sale spec sheet for room size are: 4.45mx3.53m (~approx 13ftx11ft), although there is a short wall with a window on an exterior wall.

The colour seen in the photos has been done recently, so no plans to change it when moving in. Since the room is on the main floor, it's where we will spend a good bit of our time. Our older furniture from our last home will be used in other rooms, so this is a clean slate. We plan on purchasing a new TV, tables, stands, etc for the space.

There are TV/power hookups in place both on top of the fireplace and in the corner near the window as seen in the photos - I don't know if placing a TV on top of the fireplace vs wall mount vs placed on a stand would be the way to go.

I'd like the space to be a modern, clean and comfy space that is usable but looks nice. Budget for furniture around ~$5000 - not including TV, etc.

Thanks for your help! If any more info is needed, please let me know! Keep in mind I am not in the space yet, but would like to start planning and purchasing incase furniture is a # of weeks out for delivery.

Right, so, I've bought my first house and am slowly trying to work out how to decorate each room. I'll probably but up a post per room as I get round looking at things, but I'll start here. 

As you can see below, it's quite a big space and I've mostly got furniture already that I really love (although the light wood computer desk and shelves will be replaced with (probably) black gloss ones once I have money again. I did have to ""Ripple Rocker"" chairs on order from Dwell for the ""Sun Room"" (extension with surrounding windows - the view of the hills for miles is spectacular!) but Dwell just went into Administration, so looks like I won't... At the moment I'm looking at just decorating, but am a little stuck with what to do.

I was considering, which my girlfriend likes the idea of... but I'm not so sure it'll work, was black gloss door, skirting board and radiators, the wallpaper in the album below on the wall behind the TV and the metallic silver (as in one of the photos) everywhere else (can't decide if it'll look amazing or awful, it could be very dark, but the reflectivity may mean not) then possibly paint the brickwork chimney gloss white.

The beams on the roof are fake and screwed into the ceiling, I was considering removing them but they've cut sections out of the edging round them, so I'd have to replace all that as well.

I like things very clean looking, don't really like artwork on the walls (though might mount my guitars on them possibly, I have a few more downstairs)

Oh, yes, [Photos](http://imgur.com/a/fMz8G#0)!

There's very little colour so far (I'm mainly a fan of dark blue) but quite like the silver/black/white theme. The wallpaper was the nicest I found but would rather something more abstract than trees. In my head it's got dark dragons on, but haven't found anything that works how I want it. Obviously the curtains need changing as well... What else?

Oh, eventually I want to have some sort of hidden lighting, maybe strip lights behind shelves or something. That'll come in the future as I save up, so any great ideas feel free to think of something quite out there that I could build up to! I love technology... I'll have a full stereo system and what not in there round the TV as well (along with a proper TV stand rather than a speaker cabinet! The amps will probably move downstairs).

I'll shut up now. What do you all think? Thank you!"	t5_2ux9b	True

I'm trying to get some advice prior to moving in to see if there is anything I should purchase prior to my move in date (Mid July). I know this is limited information...but I was hoping you could kind of 'visualize' what I'm going for with the layout and pictures I provided below

Hey Everyone!

First off, thanks in advance for taking a look at my post.

So I'm moving in to my first one bedroom apartment in Midtown Manhattan. I already have most of my furniture, and (sadly) a lot of it are the standard IKEA 'modern' malm looks that everyone has.

I'm going to replace and upgrade as I go...but right now I'm working with what I have.

As you'll see, I like a very modern a darker look. Grey's and blacks.

If it matters, I'm a 28 year old straight male. Going for a typical bachelor pad look.

I want to paint my room and style it somewhat after [this apartment](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/robs-flooded-with-life-small-cool-contest-190201)



So [here](http://i.imgur.com/TxhTCDs.jpg) is a layout of my apartment roughly to scale.

The couch is a black leather couch in an L shape as you can see. It's similar to [this design](http://image.ec21.com/image/carolynlong/OF0008055245_1/Sell_designer_Knoll_L_shape.jpg) but without the metal or round pillows

The bed is the [IKEA malm bed](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39849855/#/S79849844)
with end tables attached on to it. In black/brown

The bookcase is the [Ikea Billy] (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/83688210/#/40071788)
in black brown

The desk is the [Ikea Malm Dresser](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10203610/) in black/brown 

The coffe table is the [Ikea Klubbo](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80135019/) in black brown 

The letters are where I'm going to hang my ""Art"" (I use that term loosely trust me). I have very nice black frames which I'll be putting the following pictures in

The TV is a 46 inch Aquos. Seeing as it's a bit far away to view from the couch/bed with a swivel mount I'll be upgrading to a 60-65 inch eventually.

Also...I'll be hiding my desktop PC and television components in the closet next to the desk. For a cleaner look of the monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse on my desk and TV on the wall. I'll wire it all up, and I discussed that in another thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1ghbmq/question_about_connecting_all_my_components/) if it matters.

I'm looking for any tips on the layout, if I should modify how I have laid out the furniture or whatnot. From what I gather, the way I set it all up is really the only way to position the furniture. The couch being an L shape with the lounger on the left hand side limits my options.

I'm also looking on how to add color. I was thinking of adding a shag rug similar to what the guy in the link I posted did and matching decorative pillows on the couch to. 

Also, my bed spread on the malm is typically black (shocker I know)..but I'm open to changing that. Someone had suggested going super bright and doing an orange or yellow but that really doesn't fit me. I was thinking of just introducing grays or whites in with the pillows/bedspread and rug.

Again all advice is MUCH appreciated."	t5_2ux9b	True

Bedroom album in comments.	vivagypsy	7	1	6	"This is my first time posting in this subreddit so please let me know if this is better posted somewhere else or more information is needed.

I am a student and still live at home with my parents. I'm really bored and dissatisfied with how my bedroom is right now and want to change it around this summer. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/yhfUy#7) is an album of my room how it currently is. It has very sloped ceilings and isn't very large. The carpet is a red/wine color and walls are a peanut color. The carpet was the same from when we moved in about 7 years ago and we hastily painted the walls that summer as they were purple from the previous owners.

I HATE the color scheme in my room! I want lighter colors on the walls, a different color carpet, different window treatments, etc. I like beachy colors (blue, light tan, green) and don't want anything dark that would make the room look smaller.

Furniture: My current bed is a twin but I will be getting a full size bed. The green chair is being given to my brother. The giant mirror attached to the dresser is being taken down. I would like to change out the pulls/handles on my furniture. The pieces are really good quality and sturdy hardwood so I don't want to replace them, but just want to update the hardwear. 

How do I best utilize this space? What are the best colors for a sloped ceiling bedroom? Do I add window treatments like curtains, or just keep the shade?

Some notes - I'm a 22 year old college student and I feel very constricted by my lack of space at home. In order to open up more space I have a floor futon as a bed which I can just roll up and push aside during the day, opening up a lot of floor space. 

I have 3 tall bookcases and two normal, shorter bookcases. I'm hoping I can downsize on this a bit. I also have a desk. I can fit two tall bookcases and the desk on one wall. 

My room is also this odd pink color..  I was hoping to be able to repaint my room but I am not sure what color to paint it. I was originally thinking a light green but now I am thinking of a light gray and then adding pops of color in the room.

NOTE : all of my furniture is black / black woodgrain. 

I also have a 40 inch flatscreen tv that I currently have on top of one of my short bookcases. I would like to wall mount it if possible but I am not sure yet if my wall will have the proper place for me to do this. (cross beams I mean)

Unfortunately, I'm the stereotypical bachelor, and I don't have many people to give me advice (read: stop me from making my apartment look like it was designed by an electronics store salesman).

For starters, the room just has a computer desk, chair and filing cabinet.  [Here is the floor plan and some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/tBv61) of the already in place furniture.  Don't worry; all the stuff, except the desk, chair, and filing cabinet, is going to be gone soon enough.  I'm still moving in.

Unfortunately, the floor plan does not have dimensions.  I measured the wall with the window to be about 12.5ft, and the distance from that wall to the kitchen is about 17.5ft.  Also, the floor plan is actually flipped!

I'd really like to have a nice living room to hang out in with friends.  I want to have a comfy couch facing the fire place (that will probably also have a TV over it in the future) and enough extra seating so that I could have maybe six people hanging out.  Also, it's not mandatory, but I kind of want to figure out how to fit in one of those super-comfy LoveSac bean bag chairs.  I'd like to keep the budget for everything (TV excluded) to about $5,000.

Alas, changing the carpet and paint isn't an option, so I'm going to have to work with them, ugly as they are.

Here's where I need help: I'm not even sure what style of furniture to be thinking about, or how I should lay it out!  One idea I had was to get a right-angle sofa with one arm against the wall opposite the fireplace and the other arm creating a partial wall between the living room and ""dining"" areas.  I think that would be a nice way to divide up the space, but after shopping around, I got the impression that any sofa that fits that description would simply take up too much space in the apartment.

I’m hoping you can help me pick a great color for the master bathroom. We’ve recently painted the bedroom [Benjamin Moore Gray Horse]( http://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/grayhorse) and love it. However, now I’m in a bit of a pickle. You see, we’d really like to find a nice color for the bathroom that’s a bit lighter for the bathroom, but I’m concerned it might not work with the current color scheme. The bathroom has cherry vanities and a bit of orange tile work to throw in the mix. I did try using the Sherwin Williams tool from the sidebar, but without much love.

Primarily, I want the view from the master to not be “jarring” – meaning the colors need to play nice with one another. And secondly, the color needs to work with the tile and cabinets since I have no plans to replace them. Again, I'd like to keep the bathroom bright, so lighter colors are preferred.

I’ve posted some pictures from a few different angles – sorry for the quality, but it was the best I could manage this morning.

1358375885.0	16pnnn	I propose a challenge: A classroom for my Game Design course	OnlyOneMoreSleep	6	1	17	"Here's the deal:

I study Game Design at a lovely school in the Netherlands. The classes are great, the teachers are brilliant, but the rooms are awful. 

They are big, with old grey furniture and concrete walls. Half of the walls are painted white, the other half hasn't been touched. The ceiling is part ceiling tiles, part concrete and pipes. It looks like a communist workcamp. 

A few months ago our department lead asked for volunteers to redesign one of the classrooms. I got in, along with four others and one very nosy teacher. We have a budget of €400, excluding paint. We can basically do whatever we feel is right, under certain terms: We have a color pallet to keep ourselves to and it can't seem like all we do is play videogames all day. They hinted for a retro arcade/8bit theme. Which is probably the best option. The color pallet is really wide ranged, and our school is indeed pretty colorful. They have a wall full of pokemons in a room above ours. 

Current ideas: Couch or some sort of lounge, stools, floor stickers with a pac-man maze, pegs on the wall.

I was wondering if you had any good ideas, especially with this theme. I don't have acces to floorplans and photos right now, but I will post them in an edit if someone asks. 

Nothing is too crazy, this is your chance to design the ultimate videogame inspired room! :D

*Edit: Photo's and layouts*

* [Layout 1](http://i.imgur.com/zqbfc.jpg) and [with more detail and a map of the ceiling tiles](http://i.imgur.com/l84fQ.jpg?1).

* [The outside of our school.](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/34984756.jpg)

* Not the exact classroom, this one looks nicer. The only pictures I could find online, because I forgot my camera and my cell phone doesn't have one. [Number one](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3074/2884734766_4b454525ff_o.jpg) and [number two](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3020/2883898883_c659394b33.jpg). Our room has the exact same mismatch of furniture, except we don't have computers. Only screens. And we have to share a whiteboard with four other classrooms. And it has more concrete.

* The [hallway](http://foto.glu.nl/opendag_januari_2012/content/images/large/DSC_0020.jpg) that borders our classroom. Lots of red.

I hope this is of any use, I'll get better material tomorrow. Our room has one wall with windows which look into the room next to it. "	t5_2ux9b	True

Currently have no furniture other than the bed which is in place as shown. No kitchen units either so feel free to tell me to put the dining table in the living area and do something living areay with the dining room.

Plug sockets are shown although the ground level one in the kitchen area is actually a socket for an oven. Water outlet is directly under the sink to the right of the planned washing machine. There is also a cold water outlet in the corner on the other side of the bathroom door.

The tiles are more or less to scale and are 0.3x0.6 metres.

If you can find me a space for 42 inch TV and at least two loudspeakers you are a wizard, also if you can put a computer desk in there as well as sofa. (I already own these, and was into home theatre before I moved here.)

Hi, r/DesignMyRoom.  I'm looking to redo my 23'x10' media room/office/mancave (hate that word...) in our Philadelphia rowhome -- album with photos is above.  Style-wise, I find that I like simple and clean looking, but I hate the coldness of minimalist designs and prefer the warmth of arts &amp; crafts.  I guess something more like this is a good representation:  http://www.houzz.com/photos/82394/Sterling-Pointe-Redesign-traditional-media-room-charlotte

The first three photos are from the listing when we bought the home.  The structure of the room is exactly the same now, though the furniture is obviously different, except for the bookshelves, which are built-in, and the radiator/covering

The second two pictures are a couple mock-ups, which include me blowing out the ceiling and vaulting it to the level of the pitched roof (see the shot from the outside to see the pitch).  The sofa and TV in the mock-ups are there for an idea of how I currently to arrange this room, so it's negotiable.  And yes, I do plan on getting 3 televisions, as I watch TV, game, and use my computer all at the same time fairly often, and I'd also utilize the TVs for gaming nights with friends and ridiculous sports watching. 

The last photo is of the southern face of the room to show the pitch of the roof, which I think I've eyeballed to 3/12 or 4/12 before.


Skill-wise, I'm fairly capable, and I have friends and family that can help me do most anything, though I don't want to get into structural changes (but stuff like electricity, pulling new wires, and rerouting the radiator are all well within our capabilities.  

Budget-wise, I'm looking to do the room for $5000 or less, including the electronics.  I currently plan on building and upholstering the sofa myself.  I'd love to make it a (faux?)leather sofa, but I've never worked with raw leather before, so I don't know what issues I'd run into there.  

I don't know if it's a good idea to blow up the ceiling to open the room up a little, or if the gain of a 3/12 or 4/12 pitch isn't worth it.  I also am absolutely **terrible** at design, which is why I'm coming to you guys!


Any help here is greatly appreciated.  Design principles, specific Houzz links or creative ways to search (I've spent a lot of time on that site to no avail), or even just color choices would be awesome.  

Thanks!


EDIT:  I should also mention that the bulkheads and closets are going to come out.

we need help with a 5-year old girl's room. She's starting to read and write, so we need to put a table with chair, bookshelves or bookcase and/or some storage element. Please consider that our daughter Sara has a lot of plush dolls, toys, etc. and we need to arrange them somehow in her room. We thought about putting a simple table under the window (the radiator is slightly higher than the usual table height, but we can bypass this problem by using telescopic legs, such as the one sold at Ikea) and some hanging bookshelves. There are already a closet and a double-bed in the room and we won't touch them (but we can move the bed).

1375222915.0	1jdp9y	I come with a challenge: 9Ft. x 9Ft. bedroom	derrrrrrrrrrp	7	3	6	"I am moving into an apartment with a 9x9 bedroom for college. It has a small storage closet for my clothes and such. Do you guys have any suggestions for how to maximize the usability of the space? I'd like to keep it as clean and simple as possible (You could say minimalist). My requirements are:

* Queen size bed, not placed against a wall

* Table or shelf along wall for my stereo to sit at ear level and keep my laptop off the floor when not in use.

My first thought was [this bed](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S49931618/#/S19931634) with some drawers underneath (I need a queen bed, anything else is too short and hard to shop for). The idea being that the bed would allow me to eliminate the need for a dresser. I also wanted to add a small side table along a wall for my stereo.

My most recent thought was the forgo traditional furniture and get a [ Japanese Futon](http://www.jlifeinternational.com/houseitems/futon/shikifuton/shikifuton_e.html) that could be folded up and stored in the closet or a corner during the day. I could place my stereo system on a short table off the floor and have some big sitting pillows (Hell, two big dog beds would work). 

How can I get as much function as possible out of this small room? If I forgot anything (I can't take pictures as I have yet to move in) I'll try to answer as many comments as I can. I am in college, so if it can be done cheaply (Ikea budget) thats ideal, but I can splurge a bit on my living space.

I currently own a pretty expensive coil mattress (think $2,000) and I hate it. I've had it for 5 years and I'd like to switch to a futon which I have much better experiences with.(friend's house, and one hotel i go to). I sleep like a log, and my back feels much better in the morning.

The reason I paid so much for my current mattress is because coil mattresses come in all sorts of flavors and levels of quality, and figured I needed the best. Not a big deal.

But when I think about foam mattresses, I can't help but think that the product itself must be as simple as it sounds (foam?) and that a $1,000 piece of foam might not be better than a $400 piece of foam from IKEA. 
It's possible that the more expensive ones might layer the foam or use more durable materials, but in general are all foam mattresses of similar firmness and approximate level of material quality just as comfortable as the other regardless of extra bells and whistles?"	t5_2ux9b	True

* A fairly large bookcase on the brick wall to the left of where the lamp is now
* A loveseat or chair and a half perpendicular to the couch. So running parallel to the brick wall in front of the bookcase.

Besides that, I would love any other suggestions you guys have. I don't really know exactly what style I'm going for.

1372788587.0	1hif9e	Painting my apartment without shrinking the space	seanmheg	7	1	4	"I've got a question for those knowledgeable.
I've got a studio type apartment that I've been contemplating repainting in a few varying shades of blue and gray with bright white accents on moulding and built-in shelving units. Generally speaking, the shape of the studio is like a capital 'I'; Two larger spaces connected by a short hall with an entrance at one of the ends. Does anyone know how to avoid making my already limited space smaller? And does my idea sound like one that might shrink the feel of my home?
To expand on the look, it is currently almost all in an off-white gray. My idea is to start with a relatively (but not very) darker gray-blue towards the entrance/kitchen and work into a lighter gray as you move into the bed/living space. Moulding at the base and around windows, as well as a few built-in shelves, to be painted a brighter white. Also a possibility is one wall in the living area to be a contrasting splash wall.
If unclear I can further elaborate or post pictures if necessary.

1370988020.0	1g5iip	Thinking of making an unconventional change, and I need opinions.	lady_lady_LADY	10	6	3	"My house is unusual. Built in the late 40s, it was originally a symmetrical duplex and was converted to a single residence in the 80s. Because it was symmetrical and then remodeled as a single res, there are some strange things. Some rooms are narrow, there are windows in odd places, etc. Exterior shots in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/BjtFF#0) just for fun.

The reason I mention it's unusual  layout is because I'm thinking of switching the flow of the house in an unconventional way. 

The main area of the house is very open. The kitchen is open, opposite is the dining area/computer desk, and then adjacent is the tiny living room. The living room/dining space is 25'x10'. Long and narrow and the front door opens up right into the living room. No entry way, no mudroom. Just opens up and boom, there's the tv, couch, coffee table, welcome in.

I hate that the computer and living space are separated by the dining table. But we can't move the computer desk into the living space because of the space constraints/not wanting to put a desk in front of floor-to-ceiling windows.

**HERE'S MY IDEA:**

I want to put the dining space in the smaller, front room and make a sort of den/living space back with the computer where the dining space was. Here is a rough, but to scale, sketch of the [current layout](http://i.imgur.com/H2hc84y.png) (pretending that my kitchen is finally remodeled), and a sketch of the [way I'd like to lay it out instead.](http://i.imgur.com/iFBAkoX.png)

Once you've seen the sketches, here are some more of my thoughts:

* The big couch. It has to go. It was great when we first got it, but it's HUGE. Our house was made when things were tiny. And I like it like that. The second, smaller couch (and old-time camel-back) would become the main couch. I like its daintiness.

* The dining table is really more like my sewing table/my husband's D&amp;D table.. I keep most supplies out of sight (can't leave them out unless I want some cats up in that biz) and really the dining area is like a dining/multi-use space. Right now it's all up in the computer's biz.

* We use the computer for television JUST AS MUCH as we use the television. I *hate* watching our shows at the dining table/from a distance. I want the swap mainly so it will be the entertainment space all in one area.

* The kitchen is still very open. The 12"" deep cabinets lined up against the kitchen counter are 40"" high, effectively a raised bar. The flat-screen tv would go underneath that bar sandwiched between the two high-bar cabinets.  

Thoughts? All CCW welcome, even new ideas I maybe didn't think of.

**Edit: Sorry my sketches are kind of ineligible. Each square = 1 foot.**

My wife and just purchased our first home (from my parents, ugh) and we are both seriously design challenged and could use some help. You’ll have to excuse the mess, we are sleeping in the living room while the hardwoods throughout the the home are being refinished. You’ll notice in my pictures that there is this hideous brown carpet… well, that will be gone. Once the rest of the house is livable again, we will move out of the living room and they will be pulling up the carpet and refinishing those floors as well. I’ll be sure to get a pic of the hardwood for an example though.

Here's what the space looks like now and a layout with dimensions in one album (i'm an amateur so i'm sure this will all look silly to you pros): http://imgur.com/a/DnOTP

Since we are spending our money on floors at first, it means no new couch. We actually love our couch because it’s comfortable but it’s navy blue.. and we have had no luck in finding anything that matches it that doesn’t seem like it’s a nautical theme. So for starters, the couch has to stay for a couple more years, but we want to avoid a nautical theme if at all possible. Outside of that, we don’t have any other ideas of what we want/don’t want are completely open to ideas. My wife and I use this room for for lounging around and playing with our 6 month old son Wes. When we do entertain, this space will be used, but that isn’t at the top of the list since life is very family focused with a 6 month old around. We want it to be able to be 6 month old friendly and comfy enough for us to relax and take a deep breath once he goes to bed.

We have no idea what our style is. If a gun was put to my head and I was forced to answer I would say that I know we aren’t into antique stuff or ultra-modern furniture. I did the style finder on HGTV and it said I was Crafted Simplicity (whatever that means). We’re looking for paint color help, rug advice, color scheme, entertainment center suggestions, and any other surprises you designers out there have. Since we are purchasing a couch now, our budget is very flexible up to about $2500. Thanks for your help!

At the moment we have two paints, [this one](http://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-Plus-8-oz-530E-1-White-Sapphire-Interior-Exterior-Paint-Sample-530E-1PP/202179430) and [this one](http://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-Plus-Ultra-8-oz-410A-1-Monet-Moonrise-Interior-Exterior-Paint-Sample-410A-1U/202181114) (I can buy ONE more).

The room's size is around 160 sq ft and it's a bit rectangular.

The bed I will be bringing in is a full-sized bed with a headboard, painted slightly beige-white. My sheets tend to be different shades of green (light green to emerald and deep green). I also have a solid black computer case with black monitors, black computer chair, and will most likely be buying a black L shaped desk (know the infamous ikea L desk?) or at least an L shaped desk of some sort. I will also have my [fender guitar](http://www.amazon.com/Squier-Fender-BulletStrat-Brown-Sunburst/dp/B001L8NFZW/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368937389&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=fender+electric+guitar) and AMP outside at all times. I MAY get a a drawer or something like that if the closet can't fit all of my clothes (which it might not). Oh and the closet's kind of a mess but I'll post that separately after fixing up the room first.

Basically most of my furniture will be black of sorts.

The floor will most likely remain that way (just varnished) or I might get laminated flooring installed. The shade of the wood will remain about as light but the width will definitely be thicker.

**I would like a minimalist look. I'd basically like suggestions on just about everything. From placement, to color, to specific furniture, etc.**

Couple of caveats: I'd like the have a desk with large space for both computing and work and I cannot in good conscious ever place my computer on the ground. At the least it'll be on the desk itself.

Thanks all!

My housemate and I are both full-time engineers; after a long day we typically come home and both crash in this upstairs room we've just dubbed our ""rec room"". It was a bedroom to the previous owners, but we've just agreed to make it a mutual space. We both keep our computer desks in here, as well as a couch and the one TV we share.

He owns a dog that has difficulty walking across this hardwood floor, and I play guitar in here occasionally and sit on the floor. We'd like to get a rug to cover the middle of the floor in this room - between the two desks, in front of the couch and under the trunk in the middle of the room (which I move out of the way when I play guitar).

We're looking for suggestions for something under $200 if possible. The middle of the room would snugly fit an 8'x10' rug. I was thinking an Oriental/Persion rug, but am open to seeing other suggestions. Really we just need something that's comfy to walk on and ""ties the room together"". The couch is a dark brown and the trunk is sort of a marbled rosewood or something. The wooden floor itself I don't know the composition of; everything else in the room is painted a lite cream color that we don't want to repaint. The room gets plenty of light through the three windows in the back. We'll eventually be hanging some black-and-white music posters on the walls (The Clash, Johnny Cash, etc). We just really think a rug would make it all coalesce (in addition to help us move around without slipping).

Congleton_Sandback	4	0	1	"I’ve recently moved into an old office building as a live-in guardian which means that I pay really cheap rent in order to prevent the place from being squatted in. The building will eventually be demolished in a few years’ time so I can pretty decorate it however I want, as long as it’s reasonably cheap. The room measures about 4x6 meters which I’ve divided into three separate areas: office/bedroom/living room. 

http://imgur.com/a/VofQR#0

My question relates to color schemes, room configuration and general decorating ideas. You can see in the photos samples of the light brown paint that I’m considering using on the (hideous) green walls. I know darker colors can make a space feel smaller but I figure it will go nicely with the teal-blue carpet. Also, the two large windows and freshly-painted white wall should help keep the space feel quite open. 

I also played around with the position of the couch and bed but finally decided it’s better if they each go length-wise. I might install another shelf in the closet area and maybe one on the white wall near my bed. I think I quite like that large blank space though. 

What do you guys think? What would you do differently or change? Thank you for the ideas!

The entire house has been done with oak trim/doors and flat white paint (scratches/stains easily). The carpet is a whitish gray with some speckles in it.

I rent this place, but my landlord is pretty flexible. We're allowed to paint/make our own improvements within reason, as long as it's not too drastic.

This has been my home office for the last 6 years. It's continually evolved, but I've never really liked it much because I haven't done much to change it aside from some furnishings and things on the wall. I'm planning on repainting.

Some things I do need:

Cable management

A good de-cluttering

Possibly a fresh look at some of the furnishings

The desk I have is here: http://www.bushfurniture.com/workplacesolutions/Products/SeriesC.aspx?ProductSKU=WC24442A&amp;Finish=HansenCherry

Some notes:

One wall (the wall with the window) has the fusebox and a baseboard heater on it. The large closet with 3 doors is where our washer/dryer sits. The corner where the door and the laundry area meets is a little alcove.

Help me give it some life!	wendallpinset	6	0	5	"I recently moved to Europe, and found an absolutely stunning apartment. High ceilings, beautiful doors and windows. Unfortunately it came completely unfurnished (we're talking completely empty space where the kitchen would be, and loose wires hanging from the ceilings in place of light fixtures.)





The living room is the last room to be completed. Unfortunately I have run out of energy, creativity and motivation and have gotten stuck. It is furnished enough to be functional, but it is neither homey not aesthetically pleasing at this point. 





Here is the space as it currently is: 

[1](http://i.imgur.com/rv8LxfP.jpg)

[2](http://i.imgur.com/CVlD7L2.jpg)

[3](http://i.imgur.com/6edT6Kz.jpg)






This room has to be extremely functional, as well as comfortable, as it is the primary living space. It is used as eating space, working space, as well as for entertaining (which we do a lot of). So it needs to have lots of seating, as well as a surface to eat/work at (we are currently using an Ikea desk which we cannot wait to replace!). We also have a record player and stack of records which do not currently have a piece of furniture to house them, or a space for that furniture, so they need to be accounted for as well. 





Aesthetically, we are looking for simplicity, with pseudo-hunting lodge elements and beautiful, classic items as accessories. I know that's a bit vague, so here is the [bedroom](http://i.imgur.com/A4V6lRC.jpg) for comparison (the deer skull has since been mounted above the bed). 





Our budget is super small, under 1000euros. All the current furniture has been thrifted, as I am lucky enough to live in a city with great thrift stores. 





Any suggestions you may have about layout/pieces/colour scheme/style for the room would be greatly appreciated. The room needs a complete overhaul, but I'm all out of ideas. 





Thanks in advance, and let me know if there is any further information that I can provide.

Ideas so far:

* They could be stuck point first into some kind of cardboard thing, like little trees (but they take up a lot of space)
* She tried wrapping them in a paper sleeve, but it took a lot of material for each one and looked ugly
* They could be placed on a thin piece of painted wood or cardboard  such that the board is dividing the tines, and then we could probably fit a bunch on each board.

Lukkie	6	1	8	"I recently moved into student housing for graduate school and despite having lived here since August 2012, I never really furnished it. We are going into Spring Break now so I finally have some time to plan and set things up. Basically, I don't have much furniture at the moment besides a futon and table I found in a storage locker outside (yes I had permission to take them LOL).

What I absolutely need at this point is:

1. Couch
2. Coffee Table
3. TV Stand (for 42"" TV, XBox360, BluRay Player, and I have a 5.1 surround system so whatever could maybe hold the center speaker)
4. A couple extra seats 

I have a pretty nice home theater system so people come over to watch movies a lot; I was thinking that building my room around the TV would be a good idea. I took the stylefinder test and it says I prefer modern, which makes sense because I've always liked that really simplistic, sharp edged kind of look.

At the moment I am only looking to furnish the living room; the bedroom will come later. I live about 30 minutes from Ikea, 5 minutes from Wal-Mart. Other than that, I can order from Amazon or whatever. Keep in mind I'm a graduate student so I can't exactly spend a whole lot because I'm living off student loans :)

1358617397.0	16vti3	Need help designing a functional office space	jdaria	4	1	4	"We've been in this house 2 years but have not done much of anything to the room we use as an office. The fact is I barely use the space - my husband uses it the most - and I want to use it less because of how much I hate the way it looks. Also, we're renting and we plan on purchasing a home soon. My husband thinks we should either leave it as is (the desk is practically falling apart because we've already moved once with it from an apartment that had no designated office) or buy ""real"" furniture that we will take with us to our house. I just want to redesign the room on the cheap in a way that will make me use it while we are still living here. I intend to redesign the space in our hypothetical house when the time comes. Anyway, I'm going back to school and need more desk space, better organization, etc. 

Since we already inherently disagree about this, I would like to get a few ideas from you guys that I can present to him and hopefully we can reach a mutual agreement about this ""temporary"" office space. 

Here's the room now:

I am sure there has to be a better way to lay out furniture in this room. I am not super attached to my furniture so if anyone has suggestions for things that might look good I can work towards making it happen.

I don't love where my TV is but with the fireplace sticking out in the middle of the wall and the other two walls being used by windows/the opening to the kitchen I don't know what a better option would be.

I would welcome any suggestions about color or decor ideas.  I know all the furniture is dark and I wouldn't be opposed to getting a lighter color couch in the future but for now I probably am stuck with the one I have for a few more months.  I was thinking maybe an area rug to lighten up the room?

Another issue I have is what to do with the fireplace. It currently isn't functional, so I'm stuck with this gaping hole in the room... I was thinking a screen or maybe some candles.  

Anyways, here are some pictures (excuse the clutter/mess) and a floorplan:

[Here's how it looks while empty, and with the desk I'm going to use (IKEA Galant 230 x 200 cm)](http://i.imgur.com/9gBPt.jpg)

I want to paint the walls in some color, and right now I feel like red is the color I like best. 

[Here's a quick version I did](http://i.imgur.com/zmA7a.jpg). 

While it's my favorite alternative right now, I'm curious, is there any reason I wouldn't want red as my wall color (only the two walls in the photo though), mostly related to overall mood and such? 

I'm a graphic designer, so the space is going to have to be visually stimulating. I'm not using it that much for work at the moment, but that's just the kind of atmosphere I like. I'm going to do a lot of the design myself, but as with most stuff of this nature, I'd really like to hear the opinions and ideas of others as well. I'm planning on using posters, props and plants to make a cozy space. This is going to be a gaming room (PC), so picture 2-3 monitors in the center of the corner piece. Most of the time it's going to be pretty dark and I'm planning on using either wall lights of some kind, [like in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/LUQND.jpg) or perhaps some kind of LED solution behind my monitors.

My biggest challenge is finding the atmosphere pieces (posters, props etc) since I haven't been looking for such before due to very limited desk space. Color and overall smart design ideas would be welcome as well, since I'm sure a lot of you have more experience with that than I do.

1357687029.0	167nq0	Tell me what to do with my unconventional house!	TheodoreRoethke	9	4	2	"I just moved into an 1800's row home that I'm renting in an urban neighborhood. It's just me living here (Male, 25, employed) but my girlfriend basically lives here as well. I'm trying to get a bit of advice here because this is my first place on my own. This house has a strange layout but that was one of the reasons that I rented it, it has a lot of character for the money I'm paying. It's a two story house, about 800 square feet, not including the basement. I've included various pictures. Please note that none of the rooms are finished or the way that I want them, and pardon any mess you notice, I'm not done with the moving process or really settled at this point.

The couch is a Chesterfield that I had delivered yesterday. I want to kind of work with that, it's a little big for the room but I like it that way. I'm totally open to moving it wherever in the room, the spot I have it in now is just where the movers had set it. This might sound really stupid but I was going to put an area rug at the foot of the couch, I was thinking a cowskin like this: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60222932/ and then a coffee table of some kind. I want to get some ferns and things like that, I just don't know about the layout of the room, hard for me to get a feel for. The problem is that the bookshelf in the back corner is built into the wall so that kind of inhibits what I can do with the room, as well as the cellar doors, and the back door, they all need a little room. You can kind of see that all in the pictures. I have a surround sound system with 6 speakers and a TV stand that needs to go somewhere, but that's about it. I don't need a lot of furniture in the living area.

The kitchen is basically fine the way it is, I may replace the table with a smaller one, but other than that I'm mostly happy. 

Upstairs there are 3 rooms, the front bedroom (room with blue walls, being used as an office), the back bedroom (room with bed and closets) and bathroom. I didn't include pictures of the bathroom because it's pretty much set the way it is, no problems there. 

The front bedroom definitely needs seating of some kind, maybe a couch, art, something. I was going to get a carpet for it as well. Not sure. The bookshelf that is in there is not staying.  

The back bedroom, I don't really want much stuff in there. Underneath the built in shelves, I was going to put one of my Expedit IKEA shelves sideways, put casters on it and use it for record storage and put a turntable on the top of it, for bedroom listening. Other than that, some art, plants, not sure what to do.

I've just recently purchased this apartment and it came newly renovated with what I believe are white oak floorpanels and several beech wood walls. I currently live in Hong Kong the apartment so apartments are a way of life.. It's a 30 year old apartment block.. and I will be living there with my gf.

I'm a bit confused as to how I should be addressing my furniture. Especially with two types of wood that seem to dominate everything....

* Should I be picking items that are more neutral like white/grey/black to draw away from the heavy impact of wood in the house? 

* Or should I be choosing vibrant colors to contrast the wood? 
* Or...?

I would love your 5 cents please advise me on how I should be purchasing my furniture.. I will probably be buying most articles if not all from Ikea so if you have a particular piece of furniture in mind please feel free to link. Whatever advice though whether it be color schemes, how to paint the walls, etc. Would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks :D!

1352405764.0	12vh31	Furniture and ideas for minimalist (maybe TV-less) living room (apartment)?	digitalixus	8	4	1	"I'm moving into an apartment with my sister next year ([Here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/gb5sz.png) of one of the apartments we're looking at). I know a 900 sqft 2 bedroom apartment doesn't leave a lot of room for a minimalistic look. I'll be working and she'll be starting college.

We'll be starting out with nothing (no furniture) which opens some room for flexibility (but also causes headaches in shopping decisions) There are two big factors which will be affecting our design/layout: We might be moving several times from renting apartments until we can afford to buy our own place (so I'd like to have as little furniture as possible, and whatever is purchased needs to be movable) and we rarely watch movies/shows on an actual TV.

It'll be great if you all have any suggestions (For furniture/layout) and thoughts on my plan below:

* Not planning to have a TV, so I'm thinking of leaving out getting a sofa, a  TV table, coffee table, etc
* In place of where all the stuff above usually goes, I plan to get 2 tables (hopefully with wheels like [these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomas83/5740973933/in/set-72157626767455664/) ) where each of us will have our own workstation computer
* Using tables-on-wheels, we can have the stations facing back-to-back when gaming, put them together into one long desk if one of us isn't at home/doesn't need to use it, and roll one table with a 27 inch monitor to face the dining table for watching shows
* Total furniture: 2 workstation tables, 1 dining table, 2 work office chairs (which could double as dining chairs?)

Also, assuming we might move around for quite a bit (maybe once every 1 or 2 years), would it be advisable to buy expensive work chairs (such as the HM Aeron, which I understand comes assembled from the store) and furniture in general? Or get cheap furniture until we settle down?

1349813394.0	117nr3	Almost-complete bedroom overhaul, some help please!	TheDoktorIsIn	9	3	6	"TL;DR at the end.  Budget: I'd like to keep it less than $500-600, and I'm definitely not opposed to buying used/repurposing.

As the title says, I'm trying to overhaul my bedroom.  I'm still living with my parents and unfortunately it's looking like I have to stay here for at least 6-8 months, at most, well, hopefully a year.

My parents decided that in between me moving out and moving back in, they'd replace the carpet.  So, I got rid of a TON of stuff and moved some things back in, but I'm only keeping it in my room because there's nowhere else to put it; it's leaving eventually, I think.

I like a modern living space, and I believe that your living space should make your life easier.  I'm into using the computer, gaming (although mostly computer gaming), weightlifting, and paintball (the black duffel bag you'll see).  I really like the look of Ikea furniture, but they seem all about storage space, whereas I don't like storing things.  Everything that's in the room is what I own, but I'd say at least half of what's in there is going (donating, yard sales, etc.).

So, before I go too far, here are the pictures:

http://imgur.com/a/MkkBW#11  I linked to one of the photos in the album because that's the floor plan.  It's crudely drawn by myself (1/4"" = 1ft if you can see the grid markings, it's about 400sqft).  I screwed up with the main door, everything else is accurate.  The one across the bed is the front door, the one to the left is a closet, and to the right is a bathroom.  On the right-hand side wall from this image, there is a glass door leading outside.  On the left, there is a bay window.  Finally, the wall opposite the door has a space just wide enough for the bed to fit in, so I kept it that way.  Of course, I'm open to ideas.

Note about the clutter: if it's on top of a surface, it's getting donated/sold at a yard sale/going to a friend.

Now, what I was thinking was keeping the couch where it is (in the other pictures), and instead of that dresser that's in front of it (which isn't staying), putting an entertainment center for the TV.  The couch is broken, though, so it's not staying, but we already used our ""large item pickup"" this month so it's just in my room for now.  The ""Matrix"" poster is also leaving, but I have a framed photograph that's going there.

If you're facing the window, to the left I'm thinking of putting a bar for my alcohol and whey protein.  That bulletin board is leaving, but again, no room anywhere else yet.  I was thinking [something simple like this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00185584/), or maybe some hanging shelves above a wooden plank attached to the wall.  The shelves would just house a tub or two of protein, maybe 5-6 alcohol bottles, some glasses and my shaker cups.  Adjacent to that (whichever wall the bar isn't on) I'm thinking of hanging a painting I have.

The shelves under the window fit pretty nicely and I have my games on the right hand side (top shelf) and my protein/supplement stuff on the bottom shelf along with a couple office supplies.  To the right of the shelves is just stuff for eBay.  I don't sell on eBay that much so I don't want a dedicated space, but it's there temporarily.

My computer desk is where I spend a lot of my time and wow I just realized how awful that towel looks on the chair, but it's super comfortable.  For a desk I was thinking [this Galant desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99806947/#/S79836969) from Ikea.  I don't like the Micke one I have now, it's not bad but I can't lean back and this aggravates my knees (bad knees from playing hockey and paintball).  

So, that leaves the back-right corner if you were standing in front of the entrance door.  I'm not sure what to do with that.  Sorry the dresser drawer is open, it recently broke and doesn't close.  Also, the bookshelf is half-empty (or half-full, depending on how you look at it).  I could pack most of those away, but that just leaves me with even less in the room.

I can't paint the walls and the rug is a strange brownish color (which I didn't pick), and you can see in one of the pictures the color of my sheets compared to my comforter and the floor.  The flowery blue comforter is a down one that my gf lent me because it got really cold here and we haven't turned the heat on (whereas she has), so that's temporary.

(TL;DR) All in all, I'm really just looking for things to fill up the room.  It feels a little sparse and I'm really looking for ideas that I can do that'd look cool and be fun to do.  I'd appreciate any suggestions."	t5_2ux9b	True

Anyways, there's LOTS of room in there-that bed is queen sized for reference. I have a corner desk for my computer, and its what I use for movies and such, so I would preferably have it near the bed. I also have a love seat style couch, so a set up with that included would be cool too. I would also love to have some space for playing some instruments, where that stool was, there was a drum set set up, and it would be nice to have an open area for things like that. Some other things that i have are a few posters (he left the Radiohead ones behind, but I'm sure he'll get them back soon), a small book shelf, about 3 feet tall with games, six xbox 360's (they could go under the bed for all I care) and a nightstand for my bed, which is also queen sized (not the nightstand). That's about it. If you want more pictures of something, I'll get them!

1376672148.0	1khx27	What furniture compliments a wrought iron bed?	b_bright_eyes	3	0	4	"My partner and I just bought a house together and are slowly trying to figure out how to furnish &amp; decorate each room. 

Our bedroom has light-colored pergo floors that look like hardwood. And we just bought (and love) the SVELVIK wrought iron bed from Ikea.

I need a dresser - preferably something large-ish - and my partner could either use his current tall, vintage dresser that is kind of a creamy yellow, or purchase a new one that goes with what ever I get. I would rather not go too matchy-matchy with the look. And not too dark and heavy. The room gets really good light, so we're thinking of keeping the feeling of the room bright and airy.

If you want to get a sense of some of the ideas I've been tossing around. I have a Pinterest Board under the user name Lulu The Dog with some ideas for the room.

I'd love people's thoughts on how to decorate.

So we have recently updated our apartment taking out all the dark (red and black) decor touches and replacing with fresh yellow and green to try brighten the place up and some key style touches. - wish i had before pics, but i don't.
We own the apartment and we have dark furniture. The carpet is ruined cause our puppy pee'd all over it and it was a rental prior to us getting it, so we are going to add a vintage grey oak floorboard instead - here is a pic of floorboards - http://www.floorboardsonline.com.au/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/l/p/lpu1286_qslargo_interior-470x470.jpg This should lighten the place up a lot.
1 of things we are thinking is to replace the coffee table with something thats a bit more see through so it opens the space up. here is what it would like with just glass and industrial base (i used glass from existing table just for an idea of how it looks). - here is the pic - http://i.imgur.com/GT6UW67h.jpg
Also, we want to change the chairs of the table to something more modern, perhaps white like these tolix replicas. http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server3400/9la52efk/products/58/images/180/Rep_Tolix_Chair_WHI2__78309.1358827087.1280.1280.jpg
We love the current industrial/modern vibe mixed with a bit of vintage flair that is currently in at the moment.
So here are my questions...
1) How would you improve this space to look more styled, open and brighter? 2) Any designs tips, furniture movement? 3) what coffee table would you go with? 4) What chairs do you suggest for dining table? 5) what would you do with our godawful dark brown square shelving uni serving as bar. 6) next to the shelving unit/bar there is a lamp with no lamp shade. any ideas on a new lamp, or what sort of shade to put? 7) Prints? Are the right? would use change them? to what? (the bally print doesn't fit frame, its gonna be fixed soon)

In about a month I'll be moving in with my girlfriend and I'm planning the living room at the moment and I think I got the basic layout for the room down. So now it's about the colors and the style of the room.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/ryHYEpj.jpg)  is a floor plan I made with SketchUp and[ this](http://i.imgur.com/YqylIXo.jpg)  is the layout I had in mind for the furniture (don't mind the wallcolor, I was trying a few things out) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/0nhTyoN.jpg)  is a picture of a part of the room, so you can see the color of the floor.

The room will be used as living and eating space, the smaller room to the right is the kitchen. Under the window is a radiator.

A big problem for me is the greyish floor, because I can't seem to find a color scheme that fits it (I have to say I was mainly trying out the colors from pics of the IKEA website and apartment therapy). Another problem with the colors is that I'm a little Red/Green-blind. Everything I did just felt like it doesn't quite come together.

Do you have any advice or ideas for me? Styles I like are [Warm Industrial](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/warm-industrial) or [Organic Modern](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/organic-modern). The price range is, well, IKEA-like. We can paint the walls.

For the walls, I am able to paint any color I want to, so I was thinking of maybe going for an accent wall.  Any thoughts on that?

For the kitchen, I'm thinking of two stools at the sort of small breakfast bar area, along with something for that long wall.

1372887773.0	1hlesw	Ideas for a mural for my son's bedroom wall?	HeartlessTrouble	4	1	8	"I've decided to do a mural on my 8 year old son's bedroom wall this summer, but I'm not 100% sure what theme to go with. I can draw a fair bit, and paint a bit, but mainly in a cartoon/2D way. I can replicate things pretty well, though.

So, my son is 8. He likes Pokemon, Adventure Time, football (of the 'soccer' variety) and stunt scooters.

I was originally going to do something Pokemon/AdTime themed, but I'm worried about how long he'll stay interested in these shows.
I saw [this](http://capda.org/multicolored-wall-murals-as-an-artistic-solution-to-jazz-up-a-teenage-boys-bedroom-design-ideas/surf-board-and-surfing-man-wall-mural-in-teenage-bedroom-design-ideas)  and though something similar to do with stunt scooter would be cool... maybe. But maybe it's too boring/simplistic? I don't know.

I'm kind of stuck for ideas, but willing to give almost anything a try.
For now, his room is painted Magnolia, he has a pale brown carpet, and red lamp shades, bed covers, etc.

My wife and I just purchased our first home, a short sale. The floors were trashed and we've always wanted to tackle remodeling. We knew when we walked into the house to view it for the first time we wanted to buy it and knock out a wall and closet between the kitchen and the living room to open it up. So we did just that.

Now we are struggling with how to layout the kitchen and what finishes and color schemes to go with. I've put 7 different layouts in the first album, those are the ones we've come up with and we are leaning towards #7.

We are also leaning towards light green walls, a white painted shaker style cabinet with a light to medium dark counter top. We're also trying to decide on flooring. So far we are leaning towards a darker brown with a minimal grain. We also have animals so we are looking at laminate or vinyl planks.

To give an idea of what we have in mind I rendered the last kitchen layout with sketchup: http://imgur.com/a/FaiMl

We actually plan to have a 4-person dining table in the kitchen as well which should serve the 2 of us plenty fine.

If you click [this link](http://imgur.com/a/30yPx) you will find pictures of how my bedroom is currently set up. I want to paint, add furniture and possibly rearrange furniture if you think it will work better. Excuse the mess, most of it is my girlfriends

**Colour scheme**
I had trouble finding a picture of the colour scheme I wanted, the closest I could find is [this](http://imgur.com/UEl4p4M).

If you refer back to the images of my bedroom, I would like to change what is currently brown to a colour similar to the grey I provided earlier, possibly darker, in what some places call  a suede texture. 

The rest of the walls I would like to do in a more of a white, perhaps eggshell. The pictures may not do it justice but the walls are currently a crème/latte colour and I would prefer something lighter.

The cornice (currently weird green/grey) as well as the ceiling will also be given a fresh coat of white paint. 
I am unsure how to tackle the little study nook.

**Furniture**

[Malm low bed frame in black/brown](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/S79871279/#/S89871306)

At least 1, possibly 2 bed side tables like this or [this](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/80158124/) from the malm series, or [this](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/00158222/). Having trouble deciding. 

And a low TV cabinet to store my dvd’s and games from the[besta series](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/00247657/#/00218443).

And finally instead of having those crappy brown curtains, I was thinking of put a dark coloured blind thing instead.

*hope the dark black brown of the malm series doesn’t clash with the floor etc, open to suggestions*

**Decorations**
As the main wall colours are an off white eggshell and the feature wall will be suede textured grey of sorts. I was thinking of adding a bit of colour by using cushions, canvases and such in possibly a blue colour with hints of denim. Like a denim cushion or lamp shade. Or a stressed and artificially aged denim canvas on the feature wall. When it comes to this department, im really needing some advice. But would love to use denim in some way.

1368204537.0	1e2sr9	Just purchased my first home. Looking to establish an impressive style to wow visitors	Grizzlechips	3	0	2	"Hey guys.  Just purchased a 1300 sq. ft. place, and I'm really looking forward to decorating, but I have yet to finalize a layout and style for the living room.  I figure if I can get a jumping off point there, the rest of the condo will fall into place.  [I'm including the layout of the place, along with a few isometric shots.](http://imgur.com/a/UqkgW)

There's a study off the side of the living room that I would love to use as a small theater room, but I also need a solid computer area, since I spend a solid amount of my free time on it.  Ideally, I could use it as either a mini-theater, or my actual study, or maybe a hybrid of the two...

I have no furniture  from a previous place, so everything I'll bring in will be brand new, so LINKS TO AWESOME FURNITURE WILL BE APPRECIATED.  I like bold colors (I'm a guy, so take that as you will design-wise), and I'll definitely have to paint the walls soon, since they're all white.  I'm trying to avoid neutral colors and boring setups, but I'll let you have the creative freedom to go with what you think might work.

Themes to be considered:
Texas, Space (in the NASA sense), 1950's-60's American Southwest, Simple designs with bold colors, I *LOVE* the styles in [The Prisoner](http://goo.gl/SykD3) *HINT HINT*, 1960's James Bond"	t5_2ux9b	True
1368169969.0	1e2245	Help me layout my 20x24 'studio apartment'!	DallasDanielle	4	2	1	"Well, it's not actually a studio apartment. I'm converting part of my mother's barn into a apartment for me and my husband to live for a few years. We may add another room of even extend to using up the whole barn, but for now all we have is a 20'x24' room to work with for a bedroom, and living room, possibly a very small(no oven) kitchen. I plan on adding a (IDK)x24' room to the back and turning it into a closet and bathroom.

But I'm clueless on how to turn this into a living space for the next few months until we add an actual bedroom to the mix, then I'll be able to turn the 20'x24' room into a living room/kitchen.

We do have a few things that have to be in there, I have a queen sized bed, nightstand, a chest of drawers, and a media stand that is the same size as the chest. I also have a pullout couch(that pulls out to a queen I think) and a 55' tv. The pullout is going to be used for if my little sisters come stay the night with us over there, so they can have a place to sleep rather than the floor. I also have 2 desktop computers that need some sort of desk to put them on.

Please help me figure all this out! I have to layout doors, and windows too.

1368136520.0	1e11vx	Painting walls idea returns! Now with Pictures!	MissMelons	4	1	4	"Previous Topic: [Horray](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1d37ql/painting_walls_ideas/)

So census has voted no on my bamboo walling part, and the stripes are on the fence now as well. Since I was unable to get pictures previously, I hope they'll be able to help this time. In the album there are 4 before pictures and 4 after pictures of progress so far. @_@ It's not an easy room to work with at all. I hoped that whatever way the top gets painted, that it'll at least make the room feel bigger. 

This room is basically a gaming/chilling/study room for two college students. The desks are black/brown on the top with silver legs. (they're in one of the before pictures) There wont be a couch in this room, maybe a small two seated futon later though. The bottom of the walls are gunmetal grey but actually just looks like a glossy traditional Grey. If someone asked what color it is, i'd simply just say grey, and would get no arguments. It's THAT kind of grey. We had to paint the border white....again and now all that's left is the area that I wanted to have a design for. Oh, that random stripe of light blue is/was one of the colors we're working with. I wanted to try to keep the original blue color, as its not terrible, there was just so much of it. And I wanted to accent it with that light blue. 

BTW, the paint is dry....the owner of the house just left us with this glossy industrial paint to work with and for two broke college students, we didn't turn it away. Note on Industrial paint: It's great to work with, but a pain in the ass to clean and the fumes are awful. TIL.

**Planner 5D:** https://planner5d.com/view/?key=ff4fd2f4ba45c7ef8c8e9a80e4960a83

Okay, accidentally deleted my previous post so I’m making this new one for all the details I was asked to provide in the last one…

**About Me:** Single 20-something full-time engineer. Enjoys heavy metal music, science, DIY projects and bicycling. I like to be active and can be messy at times, but also like to maintain a sense of personal style and am very much into organization. Also, I’m only 5’7” tall, so having tall things in the room doesn’t seem like my style. Style Finder says I’m “Classic Casual, aka Transitional – A mix of contemporary and traditional. Usually updated, graceful, and enduring.” My favorite color is dark blue, ~~and I happen to think that color would blend nicely into the rest of the room.~~ I'm open to other color inputs on what to use, I'm no longer adamant about keeping it.

**About My Room:** Planner 5D link above is fairly accurate to the room; yes, it is crooked in some places by a few inches. Beige carpet, cream-colored walls with white trim/accents. I really don’t want to bother repainting it at this point. My room in the house is from the original structure, so most of the walls will be made of plaster (?) rather than drywall; I was told it’s probably not a good idea to hang heavy things from nails on the walls. 

Ceiling is only 82 inches, but I don’t mind trimming down curtains to fit if needed. Windows all face the street and neighborhood, and I do change in here so I’ll need curtains that are functional so my neighbors don’t get a free show. The room also includes a boarded up fireplace that I’d much rather not emphasize; I don’t like it and I don’t care to try dolling it up.

**Add’l Furniture:** Existing furniture includes a standard queen bed, and a filing cabinet that houses all of my personal documents; other than that, everything is subject to change. I was thinking of at least getting a bedroom bench with storage (Options: [1](http://goo.gl/Vouhm), [2](http://goo.gl/XHlIA), [3](http://goo.gl/g3gxy), [4](http://goo.gl/WWjsT), [5](http://goo.gl/bQEKT)).

**Bed:** I ordered a sheet set because the current one, though I really like it, is King size and too big for the bed. Hopefully this one will be just as good, I welcome your thoughts:  http://goo.gl/hCH2s

**Curtains:** Something like these; could definitely use help in picking color, as well as color/style for curtain bar: http://goo.gl/p17en

**Décor:** Definitely looking for some posters/art to fill the room; I’m particular to things like engineering drawings and retro/“vintage” pieces, such as old maps and blueprints for Modern Marvel-type stuff (see examples in Imgur photo album). The room is well-lit enough by the windows and ceiling light, so I don't think I need any additional fixtures for that.


**EDIT:** formatting
**EDIT 2:** I've gotten a lot of creative input here (thank you) and some persuasive arguments to some of the changes in the room; I'm open to replacing the navy with some other color if anyone would like to make a suggestion!

1367787801.0	1dr1fx	Need help with bathroom remodel	Douglas_Leaf	3	0	5	"I purchased a condo in October and have finally gotten around to wanting to redo the awful bathroom. It's from 1987 and is a no frills bathroom attached to the master bedroom via the closet. The main thing I'd like advice on is color selection and flooring. 

Dimensions are a standard 5x8 bathroom. 

Here are pictures showing the color of the closet leading into the bathroom. I need to know what a potentially good complimentary color would be for the bathroom. There is also a picture of the floor tile I'd like to use.

My concerns:

* would like a good color to compliment the floor tile and espresso vanity I want to install. 
* I'd like to use an espresso colored vanity eventually
* will the wood looking ceramic tiles be out of style in 3 years when I go to sell?

My first phase is flooring, a new toilet, new vanity, and paint before I tackle the shower tile later in the year. 

Any advice is much appreciated.

1366905213.0	1d37ql	Painting Walls Ideas	MissMelons	5	2	4	"I've currently moved into a new place and the people that fixed it up...painted over EVERYTHING in really dark ugly colors. I cant take it anymore. They painted over wood paneling, crown molding, etc. So my boyfriend chose to paint the bedroom, and i chose to paint our computer room. I don't have unlimited cash and they left us all the paints they used in the house. The rooms aren't very large and have cheap light brown/darkbrown carpets.

For room No 1. (The Bedroom) He isnt going for anything creative. The walls are currently...fecal matter brown (Not kidding, wouldnt be surprise if that was the name of the paint) and wishes to paint it red and the bottom part, the wood paneling, gun metal grey. I said that was fine as long as he please paints the crown molding white. That rooms fine.

Room No2. My computer room. It's currently painted a dark teal blue, its not ugly, but not what i'd like. I love blue. I decided to use the rest of his gunmetal grey to paint the wood paneling in this room too and the crown molding will also be white. I'm going to buy a new, brighter shade of blue but i really wanted to do something special with the design space. the plain part of the wall is about 4 feet high so its a nice space. The ceilings in the place are bare and white, not sure what more i can do with those.

My current thoughts on different designs consist of:

    Uneven Vertical stripes: colors: Gunmetal grey, white, the blue that's already there and a light blue.

    I saw one guy on reddit that made an awesome pixel square design, and since the space is smaller it probably wont take me near as long as it did him. It will require a lot of patience though and I could also use the color that is already there for this.

    I wouldn't mind if there was a way to cut frog tape into thin strange and make a bamboo looking wall using the color that's already there and using that as a seperater inbetween each 'bamboo shaft' the lighter shade of blue would be the contrasting color. (I've never seen this done before and have no idea where to really start)

The ultimate plans for this room is to have black framed posters ( generally 11x27 or 11x13) on the walls. The desks that are in there now are black/brown topped with silver legs (thus why i thought gunmetal grey might contrast okay with the legs of the desks) The chairs are black. There's currently white blinds but I was considering finding a light brown set, most likely bamboo or venetian to contrast with the light brown/dark brown carpet. Depending on the color scheme of top part of the painted walls, i'm on the fence about curtains. The lamps that are going in his room are a mixture of 2 cream/white cloth table lamps and 1 matching floor lamp.

Any ideas on improvements will help greatly, specially with painting. This is a room where a lot of time will be spent, since we're both in school. It's really the only comfortable place to do homework or play video games. The rooms are relatively tiny so a paint job that would make them feel bigger is choice. I wanted to use a multitude of colors because everything in this place is painted dark green, dark fecal brown or the dark blue. So Dark! Thanks for any insight given.

I may be able to upload pictures of the room later, grabbing lunch and finishing registration at the moment. "	t5_2ux9b	True

I have a 1920 California bungalow in a vaguely craftsman/mission style, which I am slowly updating.  It has thick molding, painted white at some point, Douglas fir floors, some nice built ins and lots of windows. 

For the kitchen, I am thinking a white shaker style cabinet, silestone counters in toffee, and a farmhouse sink.  The idea is to sort of fit in with the style of the house without going for a full and faithful and expensive recreation.  I plan to keep my plain white/black appliances for now, craftsman pendant lights and ceramic tile floors (I think the wood underneath is in good shape -future project!).  The walls are a nice beigey yellow, may need to adjust.

My toughest choice is cabinet pulls and faucet.  I like the look of oil rubbed bronze, but is that...not right with shaker/craftsman?  I am thinking an old fashioned looking Bellevue bridge faucet, and simple Amerock pulls on top, cups on bottom for the cabinets.  Does that sound right?  Would brushed nickel be better?  

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated!

The living room is not small (6 x 7 meters). It will contain the dining section and the seating area. I'm a big fan of watching movies, so I want a comfortable, yet cool looking living room (with a big-ass television).

I am ready to spend a few thousand euros for the transformation. I am also prepared to shop around on the 2nd hand market, although this makes it more difficult to match things.

The pictures are in this album (http://imgur.com/a/W27QQ#0). As you can see, these are quick pictures without taking any notice of the lightning. The large wall is currently in a bright green colour, while the other walls are in beige/white.

The furniture is not mine, the previous owner hower told me I could buy her couch for 500 €. But I am curious for your ideas. I start from almost scratch, so every basic idea is wecome.

The room is quite large (for a european appartment, that is), although the pictures don't show it. 42 m² matches 452 square feet. I want to preserve the space feel.

I moved into my apartment a couple of weeks ago and now I have to furnish it. I want to come up with a design so that I have a plan (arrangement and color palette) when shopping for furniture. My income is not super tight and don't mind paying for quality, but I'd like to avoid paying extra just for brand name.

Right now I'm focusing mainly on my living room, which isn't very big (the whole apartment is sorta small). It's been a bit overwhelming so first I'm trying to come up with a layout and then look at colors/styling. Because of the window placement I'm having trouble deciding a layout that won't make the room feel small but also not block the window (that's bad right?). I came up with [this layout](http://imgur.com/KmW7f5W), which I admit isn't terribly imaginative. I've included [a picture with the dimensions](http://imgur.com/WfiZvNy) in case that helps.

The area towards the bottom of the room is where I currently have my computer desk. I'd like to have a work area somewhere, but I don't know if that's the best place for it.

As for the bed, I'd *like* to keep it on the ground or at least get one of those short bed platforms so it isn't directly sitting on the carpet, and the desk has got to go, but I don't know what to do with it until I get something else.

I've been living in the apartment for a little over 2 years.  Want a redesign of my room.  I feel like I set it up poorly but I don't know how to intuitively rearrange everything.  Any advice would be welcome!  The nice part about my room is that it's pretty big, so I'd like to make the most out of the open space.

Here's an Autodesk [overhead mock-up of my room](http://i.imgur.com/YNWPy).  I took measurements, so all sizes are close, but not totally exact.  

And now for the photos.  It's a little messy and I promise that's all my girlfriends fault.
Here's a shot of [my bedroom from the doorway](http://i.imgur.com/aFWfO).
Here's a shot from [the foot of my bed towards the door](http://i.imgur.com/BMhxn).  Finally, here's a shot [from near the closet](http://i.imgur.com/DVWrv).

A few side notes.

1- The bed I'm weary of placing under those windows primarily because during my first winter here, a leak sprung from the ceiling after the weather warmed slightly.  This only happened once, but I'd rather be safe than wake up to dirty water dripping on me.

2- There's a heat vent on the interior wall behind/below the armoire.  The armoire is on legs so it doesn't block airflow into the room.

3- I'd kind of like to put a comfortable chair in there somewhere for reading.  But where?

4- I have no ceiling light and feel like that lamp is poorly placed.

5- I finally have decent framed art and such that I'll be putting up, most likely over my bed and replacing the item that's currently up.

Thanks in advance!  My roommates and I are also discussing rearranging our living room and kitchen, so I may return :)"	t5_2ux9b	True

My room now looks like shit and it doesn't really compare to the rest of my house, also my view is absolutely amazing and I don't want that to go to waste. My friends and I use my room quite often now for gaming and what not, they usually bring their laptops and 1 usually ends up playing on the bed which is impossible for doing any gaming on. I also forgot how fun reading is until now and it's been a long time since I had a good reading session so a ""reading station"" would be definitely be a plus.


**So my specification are:**

* A table fit for at least 4 laptops

* A place for 4 people to watch the TV at the same time (meaning like 2 on the bed, and 2 on a sofa or somthang)

* A reading station where I can read comfortably preferably facing the window

* A dresser (a closet where I can hang my clothes isn't required but it would be preferred

* A queen sized bed

I know the space is very little and limited and I apologize if the things I asked for might be little too much for that room, anyways it's **ca. 3m x 4m**, the wall between the window is 75cm and the door is also about 75cm.

We have been in the apartment for at least four years, and it's never been updated and has been starting to bother me lately.  

It's begun to feel cluttered all the time and I was hoping for some ideas on how I can make it feel less cluttered but warm and inviting.

The throw rug on the floor is something that I sadly, can't get rid of.  

It's covering a hole in the rug.  We were babysitting my brothers dog when he went away on his honeymoon and the dog got a thread and just kept pulling.  So it goes the whole way down the middle of the area rug, and since the carpet was literally less than 6 months old at the time, we couldn't replace the carpet.  Unfortunately under the rug is just plywood, otherwise I would have just ripped the carpet out.  

Also, the couch covers are necessary as I have three dogs who feel sitting on the floor is beneath them, lol.  I have never changed them to  because the couch is a wooden frame with just cushions, so those covers are actually duvet covers with the cushions inside the duvet.  When I went looking for new ones, i realized how damn expensive duvet covers are!

1353193644.0	13df8t	Advice on what to do with my dining room?	PolkaDotsy	7	4	7	"I have in mind a design for my dining room. However, I am new at this and have no idea whether this would look as good in real life as it does in my mind. Could you guys please give me some advice? Thanks!  
(I own the house, so anything goes, provided it's not too expensive or labor intensive!)

[Here are some pictures of its current state](http://imgur.com/a/XTkg9#0).

The table and chairs have to stay. They're not my style, but I can't afford to buy a new set when I already have a fully functional one. Unless you can link me to some extremely cheap curtains big enough to cover ~100"", those will be staying as well. Everything else can go if need be.

My main issue is with the walls - textured baby poop. I've looked into ripping it down or smoothing it over, but it seems like an awful lot of money and materials would be required (college student budget). So my current thinking was this: put white wainscoting on the bottom 1/3 of the wall, hiding at least some of that nasty texture. It would be the [plain, cheap stuff from Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/buy/house-of-fara-8-linear-ft-mdf-overlapping-wainscot-paneling-kit-32mdfkit.html). I'd paint the crown molding white to match.

As for paint, I like the idea of some kind of dark blue, maybe with hints of grey? It's a north facing room with no ceiling lights (can't put any in, either), so I worry it might be too dark for the room. The kitchen has been recently painted ""smooth stone"", which is kinda grey-meets-beige. I would like to paint the living room at some point as well, and since there are no doors between any of the three rooms I'd like colors that can kind of flow into one another.

Oh, and since the dining room is also the entryway, I was considering putting a bench and a coat rack on the East wall, where there's currently two paintings and a storage unit. Or would that be inappropriate for a dining room?

The overall style I'm going for here is classic with some modern touches, with the focus on ""comfortable"". I want people to feel welcome when they come into my house.

The setup: the kitchen is open-concept and opens into a large living room. On the other side of the living room are the sliding glass doors to the patio.

The problem: The room needs to function as a dining room, a living room and an office for the two of us. We obviously need to double up some stuff. We're using one of our computers as a TV on an entertainment unit that will double as a desk.  So that solves one problem.  

We need a dining room table that most of the time can be for just the two of us, but could also expand to be used for 6-8 people.  Then I need a desk for my giant iMac that either a) is small enough that it can be tucked against a wall and won't bother anyone or b) can double as a large dining room table when we want to host more people.

For chairs,  we're going to use these (http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/90185320/#/20115038) as both office and dining chairs as they're clear and unobtrusive.

This is a rental, so I can't paint the walls or change the shades. I also don't like the sliding mirror doors to the closet, but those have to stay as well. I like the carpet and would prefer not to change it. I'd also like to keep furniture replacement to a minimum, but if something just doesn't work, so be it. 

I plan to use the room to lounge, read, and watch movies. I have two college chairs that were a gift that I would like to incorporate somehow.  I would also like to incorporate a desk for my computer. My initial thought was to place it to the left of the couch, next to the heater, facing the windows, but I'm afraid that will divide the room to harshly. I also think the bookshelf below the tv is too high and plan to replace it with a lower, wider one and place the speakers on it. 

I have quite a bit of black&amp;white artwork that I plan to frame and hang, so I'm not too worried about the blank walls. 

Given the choice, I prefer to buy off Craigslist or used than buy new. I prefer functional to aesthetic. The style I like the most is mid century modern. 

What are your suggestions for splitting the space between the living and the studio? How can I make the room work well as both? Any other thoughts on color, more-fitting furniture, coffee-table ideas, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Was thinking of doing maybe a pastel blue gradient to white (similar to [this wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/53IZntx.jpg)) or even a pastle blue into a pastel pink with pastel green accents to achieve the sky/building/cacti look. To be honest, this is all very much elementary at the moment and more to have a discussion about what anyone thinks of those colours.

A major problem is that I live in a northern european country (big up london town bruv) which most of the year has very grey lighting. In hot countries these pastel colours POP because of the brightness of the sky, in a grey shitting england do you think they'd just look a bit too cold? Or could I maybe do a warmer shade of blue (for example [this](http://i.imgur.com/mUPyLwf.jpg)?).

Here are a couple other angles of the living room if this helps: [One](http://i.imgur.com/ISyy3ZU.jpg) [Two](http://i.imgur.com/VaP5rmk.jpg)

**Guidelines:** 

* 96"" long. Can be longer; Willing to take them somewhere to get them shortened if absolutely necessary. 

* Would prefer sheers over thick curtains so that the living room will be brighter.

* Preferably a style similar to [these](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?SKU=114830&amp;RN=129&amp;); I don't like anything overly fancy and I prefer curtains with grommets. These would be absolutely perfect if they had them in the right color. :(

* I'm mostly looking for a solid color, as opposed to something with a pattern on it. 

* [This](http://www.cb2.com/pillows/rugs-and-pillows/saudades-magenta-18x12-pillow/f8667) is one of the magenta throw pillows I'll be getting, so I'd like curtains that match that.

* Must be able to be purchased online and shipped to the US (preferably without crazy cross country shipping costs).

**Option Two:** 

I'm also willing to take suggestions on a different color that would go well with the orange. I've tried out a few combinations and I just can't seem to find anything that doesn't clash with the orange. I never thought I'd be painting an accent wall orange, but I've really gotten attached to the idea and would like to find a color that contrasts it well without clashing with it. Yellow is definitely out.

Over the last year I've picked up a couple of posters from visiting NASA centers that I'm finally getting around to framing and hanging up, but apparently none of them are standard frame sizes. They were also all wrapped when I bought them, so while I expected them to be printed like normal posters they're actually printed on paper.

Does anyone have any good ideas of how I could hang these up and still make them look good? Obviously I could have them laminated and just pin them to the wall, but that doesn't look very good.

Relevant information and width X height dimensions(I'd like to think I properly measured): 

* The three posters are going in my office/study room and there's plenty of wall space.
* All 3 are simple, white paper-black line posters that resemble schematics
* Poster 1- Apollo mission diagram: 39.5""x12""
* Poster 2- [Saturn V schematic](http://max.q.pagesperso-orange.fr/apollo/vaisseaux/images/SATURN-V-CONFIGURATION.gif): 24""X40.5""
* Poster 3- Lunar lander diagram: 24""X18.25""

Sorry if pictures of the posters would have been more helpful, I couldn't find any online but I could upload some when I get home if necessary. Thanks!

EDIT: I found a picture of the largest one, the other two have a similar look/feel.

1373922671.0	1id702	Perplexed by a gap between my desk and my wall	TheWineOfTheAndes	2	0	4	"Hey everyone,

First off, I should've scoped Reddit out to find this subreddit before moving into my apartment. It's awesome! Now that I'm here and my mistake has already been made, here's the issue.

I have this desk from Target that fits against one of my bedroom walls pretty well. I like that my monitors are visible from across my bed, so I can lie down and watch something...meaning the desk is on the ideal wall. However, there's a large chunk of wall on my right side that I feel could be used for something more useful, but the desk is a little too wide for something like another desk or flat surface to fit there (which would actually be pretty useful to me). I would like to find something to occupy the corner between my desk and my wall and/or find a surface to fill some of that space on my right.

Though it appears to be an option, I cannot reduce the desk width by moving the PC underneath the desk—I don't want to trap that kind of heat and make the computer work harder to cool itself (I also don't want to kick it).

Any suggestions? Thanks!

http://i.imgur.com/mpUN5l5.jpg

Beige cabinets are going to be painted white. The wall behind the sink is going to be painted either teal or a butter yellow, I think, unless you guys have better suggestions.

I have a small vintage kitchenware collection that I want to display on shelves above the sink. Lots of vivid solid-color Pyrex and Fire King, some Occupied Japan items, enamelware.

Challenges:   
a) due to lack of space, need to continue storing pots and pans on the wall (BUT will be replacing them soon, so I have color options);  

b) that cupboard on the right still needs to open, at least halfway. So I'm afraid of shelving going over that far;

c) coffeemaker/toaster/kettle have nowhere else to go, but I want to replace those as well. 

All that considered, this is the best idea I've had so far:

Currently, the bathroom includes a toilet and a simple shower stall (no sink/vanity).  The shower must have been added later, because it backs up into the Bilco door entrance, which is problematic when bringing in furniture and other large objects.  

Does anyone have suggestions on how to reorient the space? We want to give ourselves a few more inches in the Bilco hallway behind the shower, and to add a sink.  As this is in the basement, moving drainage lines is difficult, but one thought is to use a toilet with a  macerating pump and to move the shower in towards the current toilet (the drain would then be on the edge of the shower floor instead of dead center).

**Color**  
So far for the colors of my room, I am thinking of painting it a warm gray or beige. However, I'm not sure if these colors will match my current baseboards, moulding, covers and flooring. If they don't match, what color can I use? I also can change the baseboards, mouldings and  covers, although that would not be preferred.  


**Style**  
I did the 'choose your style' thing and it appears that the modern style would really suit me. I agree too, and would like my design to sleek and clean (possibly minimal?). With that being said, I am wondering if my current baseboards, mouldings and covers can pull off a modern look.  


**Furniture**  
i would like to have at a minimum a bed and desk in my room. I am not sure about having a night stand or additional lamps, but if it can complete a modern look I will definitely implement it. I also will have to have a chair for my desk. I am wondering what kind of chair I should get with my desk (rolling or 4 legs?). I am also wondering if I should have a rug in my room.  


**Window**  
Currently at my window are blinds that are kind of tattered up. I am wondering if I should replace them with new blinds, or to go with blackout curtains.


**Lighting**  
As you can see, the current lighting fixture in my room would probably not fit into any design. So I am wondering what kind of lighting fixture I can get. Should I get something that will make the room super bright, or something that makes the room dim at night?  


**Wall**  
I would like to hang up some of my awards that I have received over the years. I was wondering how I would go about doing so. I was thinking about using shadow boxes and arranging on the wall behind my future desk. Is this a good idea or should I do something else?

However, I can only get stuff from the store which is 4 hours away, so looking at the website doesn't help. Anyways, the couch in there is my roommates and that will most likely be taken out and put in another room. The dimensions of the room are 25 x 16.
One of my thoughts was [this awesome paint drawing I made](http://i.imgur.com/JtmuVTe.png?1) Obviously not to scale. The TV would be mounted on the wall to the right of the bookcase.

Another thought I had was taking out the top shelves of the bookcase and putting the tv there then getting a sectional/rap-around couch in there, but that would take away from the fire place. Which the TV is currently covering up. Note for the tv, it definitely isnt staying where it is because it's blocking the fireplace, but since it is summer here I don't need it for now.

The builder gave the original homeowner a flex room option, where he/she could either choose a 3rd garage port or a bonus room. Luckily for us they chose the bonus room!  
The bonus room connects directly to the kitchen as such:

(the small ""room"" by the door is a closet. sorry, not very good with the web cad software)  
.  
We want this room to become a *man cave*. I want to have 3 TVs on the wall to watch multiple football games at once (already built a rack server elsewhere in the house with 4x4 hdmi matrix switch over HDBaseT to handle the connections). I want to have a shuffleboard table. I'm thinking of installing a wet bar where the closet currently is, considering the water line for my fridge is in that part of the wall.  
The floor is currently carpet, but I'm open to dark tile or dark laminate.   
Other than that, I have no other ideas for this room.   
.  
I thought it might be fun to see what others would do with the space!  It's a tough room to fill, given its dimensions.  
I will be checking back with you guys when we get started on this room to go over our final plan, and then post some awesome before/after shots!

I'm specifically having trouble with my [living room](https://planner5d.com/view/?key=4a61788084137012856b5bfa02d2f41c). I'm worried about cutting off the pathway from the front door to the hallway (shown as a sliding door in this model, but it's really just a doorway). I don't want the focus of the room to be the tv. I can't paint the walls, but I can put small holes in them to hang stuff. I also wouldn't mind having a small foyer type area for taking off shoes/hanging coats, but it's not essential.

I plan to get something like [this couch](http://www.walmart.com/ip/15162455?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;adid=22222222227000000000&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=&amp;wl3=21486607510&amp;wl4=&amp;wl5=pla&amp;veh=sem) and surround it with bookshelves like [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.hellawella.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/5BookshelvesWrappedAroundCouch.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.hellawella.com/20-genius-home-organization-ideas/15891&amp;h=342&amp;w=383&amp;sz=159&amp;tbnid=ddJ_ZfPvyfkxoM:&amp;tbnh=91&amp;tbnw=102&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__aMw2zAAZzLg4L8vEbTVjBaCSVME=&amp;docid=0U6uQPuJKNOtVM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GN6kUbmYNIHwiwKtg4FQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ9QEwAA&amp;dur=332) (but probably black or espresso finish). I plan to get some sort of area rug and some curtains.

I also have a 3 ft wide by 2.5 ft painting (a blue, green, yellow, and orange landscape scene) in a silver frame that I could put in there or in the study.

1369664327.0	1f4yq4	I'm a student, out of term time I live at home in a boxroom (1.83m x 2.33m with additional obstactles!) How can I fit a small UK double bed?	SarkyTyke	3	1	3	"The main thing is, I only stay in this room whilst I am at home between semesters at uni, so I don't spend all my time in the room. What I would like to fit in is a UK sized small double bed (1.2m x 1.9m), so me and my gf can stay in the same room.

The issues with the room are the bulkhead from the staircase, radiator placement and folding door (does save space though). 

What me and my dad are planning on doing is making a cabin style bed, with a simple box frame for the mattress to rest upon, then a box base at one end (possibly short set of drawers/cupboard) and smaller legs to rest on the bulkhead, so its raised 0.5m from the floor.

Here's a Sketchup model of the room if it helps anyone visualise things:

I'm moving into the upstairs room in my apartment in a few weeks when that roomate moves, and I'll have far more room than I have stuff for right now.

The attached picture is the current layout of what he has in there (very sparse Buddhist guy).  Hardwood floors, and the roof slopes down to the West.  It's a good 5' at the lowest point.

The stairs are on the North wall.  70' out of the West window is the interstate (not too noisy though), hidden behind some trees.  The window to the South leads to a major road and has a small balcony outside, but no actual door to it.

I'm thinking of building a 6'x2' desk out of birch and black iron water pipe, the only place bright enough is where the current desk/bookshelves are.  Maybe a raised daybed sort of thing for a reading nook by the West window.  Bed aligned probably on the South wall.

I can build what I need if I need it, the rest will be used stuff found locally.

I'm really not sure what to do w/ the rest of the space though.  I may buy his exercise equipment if the price is fair, or I may move my treadmill up there, but I still want a more livable space that will help prevent me from just sitting in front of my computer all damn day every day.

I'm moving into a new apt soon.  
I'm looking for ideas to furnish the living and the bed rooms.  
 
This is the apartment floor plan: http://i.imgur.com/Whend1p.jpg  
The bedroom has 2 windows that looks out on to a busy street.  
The floors are all hard wood and the walls white.  
The windows in the living room have a half obstructed (by store underneath) view of the sky.  
Not much of a view.  
The doors are old style and very tall (8 ft).  
The apt itself has been around since 1900.   
I don't want to splurge, but dont want to skimp on it either.  

I like the following:  
1. Japanese style platform beds like these:   
http://www.amazon.com/Fujian-Modern-Paltform-Stands-Espresso/dp/B003RX2D48/ref=sr_1_69?s=furniture&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368913267&amp;sr=1-69  or      
http://www.houzz.com/photos/732453/Hayneedle-asian-bedroom-  
2. IKEA tall square bedside lamps:   
http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30232225/  or    http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30184173/   
3. Wooden furniture (not too expensive).   
4. I like minimalist cabinet design that serve multi purposes.  
5. Like minimalism - not too many, but clean and neat things.  
6. Like the bamboo window shades.  
7. Like plants inside the house.  

I understand these may not all go well with each other. 
I'd like suggestions on placement, brands and creative additions :)
Thank you.

1368492785.0	1ea7fx	Wall Lamp Placement in a small condo with high ceilings	wiirenet	3	1	5	"Hello,  

I have these gaudy/dorky dragon lamps that I want to hang in my new condo. Since they seem like a big commitment - As in, it won't be easy to move them around and patch the hole up - I want to be sure my placement is good.  

Does anyone have an opinion? (Yes I know the lamps are a bit odd but I'm mostly looking for placement opinions not just ""don't put them up they're weird.."" So I appreciate any thoughts! Here are some photos.  

I have 4 lamps. I want to put 2 above the couch with a tapestry between them. Here is how our couch is set up.  

http://i.imgur.com/rHSdgUq.jpg  

The lamps and tapestry would be centered above the couch - not on the wall. Does this seem visually appealing? I feel like the right side of my wall near the door will seem empty and off center.  

The other two I am stuck on bc my idea doesn't seem to want to work:  

Here is a panorama from one side of the room  
http://i.imgur.com/lGAFGQd.jpg  

B is the same lamp above the right side of the couch, you can see in the first photo. C is where I wanted to put another lamp, but now I don't know where to put it bc of the below issue. D is on a small wall between my kitchen entry and the living room area, where I wanted a lamp.  

http://i.imgur.com/mztXkgU.jpg  

Here is a closer photo of the two lamps C &amp; D from the panorama. D seems ok, but here is the issue with C:  

http://i.imgur.com/JSw3id7.jpg  

We have a tight fit bc of our couch to enter our place and living room. And the lamps have a shorter cord than I thought. Excuse my BF in his PJs- I made him get up from a nap. He is 6ft. So as you can see, the lamp is low and in the entry way. We cannot push our couch back to make the entry larger. Do you think that is horrible placement for a low hanging lamp?  

I really wanted all 4 lamps in our living/dining room area, but I can't figure out the best place to put C that I wanted on that wall with the book shelf.  

Here are a couple ideas:  
Hallway: http://i.imgur.com/Wj18dox.jpg (this is the dark hallway in the panorama photo, the dark area to the right of the brown double door closet)  

Flanking the kitchen entry http://i.imgur.com/3Fv1H5N.jpg  But we already have a big chandelier lighting that area. And I don't like the kitchen so it seems weird having lamps flank my crappy kitchen.  

Last, my ideal C position could maybe work if we used an extension cord to raise the lamp but I don't know how to make that look nice and hide the 2 cords, I worry it will look really bad with an extension cord (since it already looks crappy with the regular cord). But it is high ceilings so maybe raising the lamps to above my BF's head (he is 6ft) would be best?  

Please please i would love any opinions! Even if its just to say my place sucks haha. (of course excuse the mess, we are still organizing after moving in)

Also currently the flooring is concrete underneath the carpet, so what would others recommend as far as installing it? Would you recommend using padding ([something like this](http://www.elastilonusa.com/)) and/or having a floating floor? or would you recommend using some sort of adhesive to hold it down?

Closing on a new house shortly and the lady and are I struggling going back and forth on photoshop with colors for the downstairs area. Below i have pasted a link to pictures and floorplans to the house. The main thing we are trying to figure out right now is the foyer, kitchen and living room areas.

I guess a style we are going for is..contemporary i would say. Something along those lines/modern.

We were thinking a neutral, light tan would be the only way to go for the foyer and base color as it also flows into upstairs halls, but are open to any input.

We also really love emerald, so if we could incorporate emerald into the kitchen one way or the other that would be awesome.

It's like, canary yellow. The wall that my bed is against is covered in paper that's covered in poetry and I painted the verse of a poem on the other wall but it really just looks terrible. It's an incredibly tiny room. There's a piano under the window, a closet that takes up one wall, a bookcase, desk, and dresser on the wall opposite my bed, and then the wall that has my bed, which also has this ugly TV that I never use hanging above it. I don't know what to do. It's a disaster and I just hate it and I can't paint it or anything. I don't even know why I'm typing all this out.

Niether my wife nor I have much design sense.  I'm a wood working by hobby and while I can make a nice piece of furniture, I can't match it with stuff like curtains and a bed spread. 

Here's a panorama of the room.  The dresser, headboard, and floating tables were what I built.  Now for the design pieces.

Thoughts:  Painting the walls?  Maybe just an accent wall or 2?  Adding some color?  I love the black furniture, but the black and white is awfully stark.

Love to hear some crazy ideas.

I finally got around to cleaning my room out after years of mess and hoarding, so I've now got close to a blank canvas to work with.

[album!](http://imgur.com/a/ZLFs4)

Ignore the vacuum, the sheets and everything else, as I took these photos just as I finished up cleaning! The small dresser by the door is also not there anymore.

I'm limited in the way that I can't change the carpet, which is a shame. Yet, I'm willing to try and incorporate the colour into some sort of colour scheme.

I've been thinking of either:

-White, Stone &amp; Black/Charcoal

-White, Stone &amp; Navy/Some shades of blue and maybe grey

OR

-White, Stone &amp; Coffee/A shade of brown

I'm willing to either paint the furniture (desk and shelves) another colour or to possibly consider buying different furniture altogether. I was thinking of possibly painting them a stone colour or possibly a beige colour (I'm really open to advice on colours tbh). It's also possible for me to paint the walls, but I thought the white would work well with any design I went with (let me know).

I'm buying new sheets, pillows and everything for the bed tomorrow so I would love some advice on the colours for those as well!

I'm also planning on decorating the walls with some kind of art. I was considering creating a few black and white posters with the rasterbator (found online) or to perhaps purchase some kind of canvas art. Honestly, I have no idea and would love some advice here!

Basically, I wanted to ask everyone's opinions on the colours, what might work and don't be afraid to tear my plan apart!

EDIT: I thought I'd also mention that I did the quiz in the sidebar for my design style and I got contemporary. "	t5_2ux9b	True

[Quick, probably unnecessary video of space in question](http://tinypic.com/r/vdngj/6)  
We went to a furniture store yesterday and ordered a [sectional](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-FAB-00221_1408759K.jpg) (in more of a beige, stone color than what's pictured), [dining set](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/BOR-DRF-00005_1409197K.jpg), [coffee table](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-OTB-00206_1398305.jpg), [end table](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-OTB-00193_1391964.jpg), and a [sofa table](http://images.dufresne.ca/medium/ASH-OTB-00159_1382353.jpg).  
We came home and decided that we didn't really like the pieces as much as we did in the store, so we cancelled everything but the sofa, which we love. We were going in the right 'direction' though, but I think we want more of a rustic/modern minimalistic look...whatever that means. We love the wooden DIY tables seen in [/r/DIY](http://i.imgur.com/G9aqK.jpg?1), as well as [this dining style](http://www.hallofritz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/table02.jpg).  
In terms of layout, we want the 'entertainment area' in one of the window corners of the main room, facing the window..using the sectional to kind of divide between areas. We're planning on installing a floating desk along one of the walls..we're thinking in the 'dining area' on the floor plan, but it's not a solid plan and anything can happen at this point. Anyways I guess we're just looking for suggestions..seeing if anyone has any theme ideas, maybe some end/coffee tables that would match our description, or some help with the layout. Thanks!

There is a (structural?) pole (~10"" on each side) towards the middle of the area (colored squares) with a finished beam? connecting it to the walls (left and down in plan below).  The ceiling drops a foot or so for that beam, but the beam is only as wide as the pole.  Everything else is wide open, and the floors are wood laminate.  There is no TV in the room right now, and it is not a requirement.

Current plan is to add a 6? person table to the nook at the top, but I have no idea how to arrange seating in the living room.  Is a sectional or sofa/love seat/chairs more appropriate?

1355091496.0	14kgt2	DIYing expanding my office.. tips? ideas?	timeFixIt	5	3	1	"The office building we are in is pretty old and neglected. We are the first people to use this space in probably 15 years... 

I have a decent idea of what I want to do (maybe) but there is so much awesome here I thought I might check in here. 

I am wanting a cool and comfy space for about 4 or 5 nerds. There will be a larger open area and two small offices. (see floorplan). 

The building has some cool features. Exposed brick (needs cleaning, no prob) and some old cast-iron fireplaces (just for decoration, I guess) 

*Floorplan: http://imgur.com/1p19V
*Pictures: http://timfixit.imgur.com/ 

The doors to the office area are not there yet. You can see in one of the office photos there are some 2x4s in a plaster wall.. those will come out. I am thinking that wall will have two glass doors with dark aluminum frame (and windows to the rest of the office). Doors kinda like [this]. (http://www.northliteglass.com/media/images_upload/product/commercialresized.jpg?rand=898931614) 
with maybe a tall thin vertical window next to it. 


The office on the right won't have any windows. Since the ceilings are tall (12.5f') I was going to put about 4-5 1x1 windows in the wall between the two offices. This way the ""inside"" office will get some light from the windows in the neighboring office, and from the front part of the office as well. 

Since the non-brick walls are plater, and in roughish shape, I was thinking I could do some kind of texture on the wall but nothing too over the top. Maybe silver and white? 

I was thinking this for the [hard wood floors](http://www.houzz.com/photos/125447/Montaigne-Collection-Charleroi-Wood-Floors-eclectic-wood-flooring-other-metro) . 

For the two radiators -- paint them black. For the window trim and trim around the doors -- maybe white? 

I am going to drywall the ceiling and put in some recessed lights and track lighting. Probably two long strips per area running north to south in the floor plan image (?). 

There is an old archway to other offices (its been walled over on both sides) you can see in one of the photos. There is some old duct work that is not being used that goes through the wall where the archway is.

As this is the oldest part of the building the floor is also about 6 inches lower than the rest of the building when you come through the door. So I will probably build a little wood platform to step down on to (just one step) when you step through the door.

This office space won't be for clients or anything.. it is going to be a super comfy collaboration space with whiteboards and probably bean bag chairs and some desks. 

I have some old steelcase desks that will probably work well in here, but not averse to something else. 

The brick I intend to clean with a wire brush and then sponge it down and seal it with some type of low lustre compound to help keep the dust down. 

I will be happy to post ""after"" photos when I finish. In several months. 

What do you guys think? Houzz.com has been a good source of inspiration but I wish it was easier to find comparable commercial spaces on there :)

We are moving into our new house and the decor is not my taste, as is to be expected. Here is an [album of pics](http://imgur.com/a/84Qz1) from the realtor. FYI, none of the furniture or anything is mine. As you can see, yellow is the dominant color throughout the house. Yellow paint and light for some reason makes me feel really bad, so it's gotta be changed. I am not an earth tone person and I have ZERO fear of intense color and very much prefer it. I was planning on making any neutrals a light gray. 

Eventually, I will be able to make up my mind on how I want most of the rooms painted, except the room with the stone fireplace that I am planning to make a library. The stone pretty much dictates what I can paint the rest of the wall so I'm feeling really restricted. That goes for the foyer where the stone continues on the opposite side of the fireplace. There is a long, tall wall that extends from the library, through the foyer, and up the stairs that I am planning on making light gray.

1. The Couch. I'm thinking about going with a sectional like the previous owners had. Any objections? Color suggestion?

2. Entertainment Stand. The one pictured is from IKEA and I'd like to get something that doesn't scream apartment/dorm room. The speakers are staying though, they're new.

3. In the original owner's pictures you can see a bar in the one corner, I would love to get a bar for that same spot. Any ideas?

4. I loathe the fabric on the bench area. Any suggestions there? There is storage underneath.

5. Other furniture. Should I go for end tables and a coffee table or just one type? It's not pictured very well, but there's an end table in the far corner next to the couch.

6. Artwork. I'm pretty lost here, I don't know what to go with. I love sports, but I don't want a typical 'sporty man cave' -- that's too tacky IMO. That one picture is a press that the newspaper used to print newspapers and was given to me by my great grandfather, so it's special. 

One idea I did have was to get prints like these, they're sports related, but a little more 'mature' looking:

I'm a big fan of music too and the other idea I had was to get concert prints, stuff you find on this site: http://www.gigposters.com. The only reason I'm not too keen on that idea is that I'd like to decorate my office like that instead.

Also I don't know where to place the TV. The jalousie is almost always closed on the windows with the TV in front of it. If the Fireplace weren't there I would have placed the TV to that wall, but then the problem would be that the couch would be in the way of the door to the garden.

* We're renovating a unit in the same line that we live, so these are pics of our apartment, even though the unit is a gut reno (and there are some details different, like the pony walls were removed in ours, but we're keeping them in the new place)

* See floor plan (pic in album below) The room is right off the front door, and from the front door you can see through the foyer to the living/dining room with a large window. The living room is light yellow

* Architectural details: There are (what I've recently learned is called) pony walls and an archway leading into the living/dining room. There is also picture rail high up on the walls.

* Rug: There is a red/white/blue (but not patriotic-like) Persian rug which we're keeping in the space

* Furniture: We will be using (what my mother calls) a schrank, which is a large, wooden linen cabinet (see pic), and a wooden side-by-side.

* Lighting: We will be using an antique brass and painted glass chandelier.

Thinking an azure blue like [this](http://www.houzz.com/photos/29273/Carson-Poetzl--Inc--mediterranean-living-room-phoenix), or a grey-blue like [this](http://www.houzz.com/photos/2345608/Residential-Projects-traditional-living-room-london), or even a red like [this](http://www.houzz.com/photos/71177/Warm-and-Eclectic-Living-Room-eclectic-living-room-boise).

Other things to keep in mind: The living/dining room also has a lot of wood and a very large oriental rug which also has blues, but is mostly red like the one above. The kitchen, which is right off the entrance door is going to be very industrial/modern look with one bright orange wall (which is throwing me off a bit with using a red in the foyer, but hey, I'm no expert.)

I look forward to hearing your suggestions and please let me know if you have any questions! Thanks!"	t5_2ux9b	True

Hey guys! So my parents are thinking of painting me and my sister's rooms and they asked us what color would we like to paint them and I thought about, instead of painting the walls of a different color, I thought about painting them white and then, since I'm a game lover, just buy some posters and official art from different game developers' websites. However, first of all, I don't really know how I would fill the walls, in other words, I wouldn't know where to buy the posters and art; second of all, I don't really know if that would work out, I mean, visually, would it be nice to look at or would it just be some posters on a wall making the room look terrible. Anyways, this is basically me, asking for opinions and help here :) Thanks for any answer that might come forth ;)

I've been living here for a while now and decided it's high time I make this place look like I live here. I'm going to be redesigning the whole place, but starting with my living room. I like a more modern, high tech look.

From the pictures, the bose speakers and desk will be gone for sure. I'm building the big speakers so I would like to stick with those and have another polk audio center channel not pictured. I'm thinking of putting the subwoofer behind the couch, and potentially getting a new couch(es) or at least reupholstering this one as I'm not a fan of the design. I will be getting [this used tv](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2743741) or a new 55"" lcd tv. I'm going to build a custom media center, thinking of a nice black finish, but not sure if it should be long enough for just the tv and speakers on the floor, hold the speakers and tv, or go the whole length of the wall. I'm also an avid diver so I want to put some photos from my dives on the wall next to the door. I have the 3 11x14 frames in the photo or I can get new ones.

I also like comics, and I would like to have a book case somewhere in the room to hold all of my trade paper backs. I also have tons of comic related prints (11x17) that I could hang up.

Finally I like movies and music, so setting up a home theater is also something to think about.

I've recently moved into a house and so far have thrown my stuff into the basement for lack of anywhere else to store it. Now I'm looking to turn the space into a studio for myself to work in.

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/JMVft
Rough blue-print: http://i.imgur.com/0OcWsIth.jpg

The main purpose of this room is for me to sit on a desk and write fiction or code. I also play a bit of music and would like room to setup a synth/guitar/bass stands and a small laptop to serve as a music recording station. Lastly, I obviously have a ton of books I'd like to display in an aesthetically pleasing way.

Nice to haves:

- I'd love to have a small workspace on a wall (white board or white-board paint) somewhere within easy access as I tend to take extensive notes and draw diagrams quite a bit to help my work-flow.
- Some kind of rug layout would be especially nice as the tiles get a bit cold and I like the feeling of fiber under my bare feet
- 3 distinct ""areas"" - one for the desk/computer/work and the ""whiteboard"", one for music and one for books/relaxing. I'll probably want to move a comfy reading chair down here as well and maybe a couple of beanbags for company
- I'd love to get rid of the wall sconces and come up with a more attractive and less stark lighting pattern
- I'd love to paint the walls or maybe even just do one accent wall, but not sure what colors to go with
- Can't do much about the pillars or the doors or the tiles, but almost anything else I'd be willing to at least try to mod

I'm moving to a new place and have zero furniture.  I'm excited to design the space and would LOVE some help :)  

**Quirks of the space**:
The closet doors open outwards, and are floor to ceiling making it a difficult wall (perhaps a roman shade or no door closet with great organization can fix this?)

The window in the living/bedroom is all encompassing on a diagonal wall.


**Use of the space**: Sleeping, working from home via the computer, having small groups of friends over - very occasionally. 


**Concerns**: I'm not sure if having a bed in the space makes sense in order to get a nice workspace/lounge area out of it.  Is a full loft-bed more feasible? If so - what wall do I put it on? 


**Aesthetic**: I like clean and white with pops of colour.  I like the more industrial look that has come into style.  I like stripes, 'natural' looking things, and clean lines. I love statement wallpaper or statement art pieces on a wall.

**Here is some general information**

* I would be using this room to sleep, study and goof off on my free time. I would also have my boyfriend staying over on the weekends.
* Room dimensions are 13’3” x 11’1”.
* Here are some weird/skewed panoramic photos [photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/pAmrdaD.jpg) and [photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/Q8GdXbx.jpg)
* My room has weird [maroon floor tiles](http://i.imgur.com/7FmiGHl.jpg)
* I’m keeping the dressers and the night stand but I’m getting getting a Queen bed soon.
* Overall I would like to achieve a soft romantic look for this bedroom :)

**And these are the things I would love suggestions on:**

1. What wall color walls could possibly match my maroon floor tiles? Here are a few color samples I picked up. I want a lighter color. Feel free to suggest colors that are not here! [sample 1](http://i.imgur.com/1QC9HQp.jpg), [sample 2](http://i.imgur.com/KMrLUXe.jpg), [sample 3](http://i.imgur.com/Mujuh89.jpg), [sample 4](http://i.imgur.com/YFV34UR.jpg), [sample 5](http://i.imgur.com/g4d3qhW.jpg)

2. For my new bed, I’m thinking a frame and a headboard the same color as the 6-drawer dresser. If everything stays the same it should look like this with the queen bed in: [Floorplan with new bed in](http://i.imgur.com/qgyZme4.png). 
Any suggestions for bedding? 

3. I want a big rug to add coziness but I can't think of a rug color that would match my floor tile color. Suggestions?

4. I like my dresser in general but it has this weird cork board panel that I really don’t like. [See?](http://i.imgur.com/sFchZSi.jpg) How can I make it look better? I was thinking of getting a picture the size of the panel and sticking it there. 

5. I really need to bring in some sort of desk to study on. I don’t need a lot of space just a surface to put my laptop on and preferably with some space to store books in. I have no idea where I would place a desk though. I was thinking maybe if it’s high enough I could put it against the air conditioning thing on the window wall since I never really use the AC and probably never will.

6. I really want to get an Audrey Hepburn picture enlarged and framed to hang on one of my walls. Still unsure of what picture to use, what kind of frame to get and what wall to hang it on. I love [this picture though](http://classnfab.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/audrey_hepburn_poster012.jpg)

7. Any other decorating ideas that you think would follow a romantic theme would be greatly appreciated!

I'm looking for a more of a minimal, yet professional room. I've already chosen which [desk](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/S19852113/#/S69806816) I'll be buying. The things I'm struggling with are the color of my room, paintings/photos to hang up on my wall, my blinds and my bed linen. I'm open to all suggestions, thanks guys!

White walls, hardwood floors. I want a place that reflects who I am, and was really trying to purchase an Industrial place because I love that brick/concrete look, especially when it is mixed with some wood. Unfortunately, all the lofts I could find were either out of the way or too expensive, so my new place was a good compromise. 

I train Capoeira, I do gymnastics, and I love to read. I don't like to watch TV and don't plan on having one in my house. So I want to go beyond white walls, especially since I do a lot of hand stands and other stuff against the wall and they'll be getting dirty, lol.

**In addition to the living room area I also need to have:**

* a workout area with a punching bag and rings

* some open floor space to move around (for dance/capoeira)

* my home office (I work from home and want a pretty decent sized desk)

* a dining table that can be converted to a poker table

Here's a link to photos of my place:

and here's a link to an album of rooms with designs I like:
http://imgur.com/a/CNZPF

I'm not sure how I want to arrange everything but right now I'm thinking of trying to keep the workout stuff in my bedroom. This would including painting a wall with chalkboard paint to keep workout data on there and other notes. I'm considering where to put the office: in the living room area or in the alcove next to the kitchen? Or should I put the poker table in the alcove?

I would love to do something cool in the hallway. Wood would be awesome, but probably not practical. Maybe wallpaper? Or should I just paint it to match the living room?

My plan is to come up with a two-tone paint palette for the living room (currently thinking something green and gray) and a separate two-tone for the bedroom (maybe something blue and gray).

I think the kitchen looks good as long as the kitchen cabinets are an actual timber veneer and not melamine made to look like it. If so the easiest change to make to the kitchen down the track is to the cupboard fronts rather than the benchtop. They will all be standard size so an easy thing to swap out. There are loads of modular kitchen companies around who do parts of a kitchen and not the whole thing and they can provide good advice on colour/finish etc. For the lounge and bedroom I suggest you look at some on pinterest (you dont need to be registered to use it) and collect all your favourites together - that will give you a good idea of what aesthetic direction you want to head in - eg: colour, materials, lighting and you can then you can start building a specific picture of what you want. I suggest neutrals with some colour brought in using a rug or artwork and some good air cleansing potplants. If you do have Ikea nearby then you could always just go and pick a look you like and build it out of their catalogue. Good luck! I look forward to seeing the results :)"	t5_2ux9b	True
1371168809.0	1gb0fd	Help me decide on a layout for my new living room	calidoc	1	1	0	"Hello all,

Moving into my first apartment the second week of July. (Stoked) And need some help laying out the living room. What I current already have is the [entertainment center with 2 tower speakers](http://i.imgur.com/OK2GT9v.jpg). I plan on getting a couch, chair, coffee table and an end table for this room. Here is the [floor plan](http://i.imgur.com/FuwtxWK.gif) (It will be flipped in mine with the living room on the right side as you enter). And here is the [Planner5D](https://planner5d.com/view/?key=a7a2e807bbfea459c726cf83b8c45fec) with the layout I currently have in mind as well as using actual diminsions (I erred on the side of caution with my measurements and made the walls an inch or two shorter) between doors etc. This plan is using diminsions from the furniture I have my eye on, and which follow a basic size. &lt;edit to add&gt; The chair is oddly faced, but the fact that behind it opens to a hallway and dining room really opens up possibility to turn it and not be an issue.

How does this look?

Side note: I have [these items](http://imgur.com/a/XxvCq) professional framed. I was thinking of using the Vinyl record as decorations here and putting the others in the dining room or bedroom to sort of hide them but still display them. They didn't seem very living room-y and /r/interiordesign kind of agreed. But the vinyl I think looks awesome. All items are autographed."	t5_2ux9b	True

Hey guys, so right after finals, for some reason I started getting into this whole home makeover thing for my room. I feel like I've done all I can think of and now im looking for outside help from people who know more about this stuff.
* http://imgur.com/a/WNgVU#s1FO02d
* The first 4 are from before; the rest is current.
* Dropped about $250 total so far.
Some background info you might need to take into consideration:
* I'm 21(m) and in college.
* I live in Hawaii, where moving out is not an option until 25-30 so I am living with my parents.
* Any insight on what college girls might like that will set me apart from other guys.
* I have already invested into my bed (memory foam, 400+ thread count etc).
* try to keep everything below ~$500 lol

Here's a few questions I have: 

1: So I guess I'm allowed to hang things on my wall for now (the wall is stucco) so any opinions? obviously I cannot afford really expensive art.  I was thinking about grabbing this http://25.media.tumblr.com/971a4faae6a28dbe1384c0b3eafc7509/tumblr_miw449hRcy1qbs6i5o1_1280.jpg or if that is too much than maybe http://wallpoper.com/images/00/23/85/54/abstract-deviantart_00238554.jpg ? since a huge picture frame would be extremely expensive, i was thinking about buying 3 smaller ones and cutting the photo up into each one and putting them side by side so i'd look like this http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/10600329/2/stock-illustration-10600329-background-with-multiple-tv-sets-and-radar.jpg''

2: I removed the beer and shot glasses off the drawers, should I just leave it mostly empty or should I put something on top?

3: what should I do about my desk? keep it completely clean like it is? put stuff on the top? plants?"	t5_2ux9b	True

Moving the desk into a separate room would be nice, but there is no room at the moment. Also the closet is very heavy and can't be moved, due to it being solid wood and filled with stuff...

I'm hopeless at room design, and having a fireplace and radiator in a bad position make it even worse. I would like a more open plan space, but getting rid of any furniture apart from the bookcase would be a big no-no.
