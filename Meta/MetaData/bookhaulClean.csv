I recently went to my local used book store and picked up a few volumes. Lately I've been in the mood to read books I haven't read before (I keep reading the same ones I love over and over again...), so I picked some books in genres that I like at random to see where that would lead me. In one of the books I picked up I found [this note](http://i.imgur.com/PnJoRRI.jpg). 

That's one of the things I love about used books. The stories that are in the books. You know, not just the ones that are *written* in them. But their previous lives that you can sometimes glean out of them.

Oh! And here is my whole [mini haul](http://i.imgur.com/7YxOHpn.jpg)!"	t5_2sfnu	True

A solid and very rare early 17th century edition of Homer's Iliad published in Geneva by Paul Estienne, the son of the famous classicist publisher Henri Estienne. Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were perhaps the most cultually influentual works in the Western canon from ancient times through the 19th century. This is one of the earliest complete texts of the 24 volumes of the Iliad, in both Greek and Latin. This book unfortunately lacks the title page, but it does have a dedication by Paulus Stephanus, dated 1604. That is the Latin version of the name Paul Estienne, a noted printer in Geneva at the time, whose publishing house specialized in ancient classical works, often in new and better translations and editions. This small and very thick book has a parallel text in Greek and Latin. This book is otherwise complete and the text is in nice condition; without torn or missing pages or writing or markings in the text. The book has an old or original leather and marbled-paper binding, with marbled-page edges. Published more than 400 years ago, this book is now exceedingly rare, as there are no other copies of this book listed for sale on the internet, worldwide, at any price. Therefore it is now virtually inobtainable. Worldcat lists only two other copies of this book, both in the Bibliotheque National de France. "	t5_2sfnu	True

I work for a school district and in the basement of our admin building the district library office has shelves of discarded (overused or under-read) library books from all the schools. 
These books are free for anyone to take, and I usually grab a few a month for myself and my bookworm daughter. I've found some decent copies of books I'd forgotten (The B.F.G., The Egypt Game, Ozma of Oz) and even discovered some cool new ones, like a poetry book titled ""A Snail's a Failure Socially"".
If anyone is looking for juvenile or young adult books, or even some classics from the high schools, check to see what your local school district does with their discarded library books."	t5_2sfnu	True

I thought that maybe r/bookhaul would like to gain from this, but I am not sure if that would be apropos here. Basically what I would be looking to do is not sell them individually but as lots of, say, 10 paperbacks or 5 hardbacks for 2 dollars + shipping. All of the books are used, and I would include pics so people could see the books being offered.

I have been searching reddit for a book selling sub but with no success. I figured that my fellow redditors here like buying lots of books for cheap, so it couldn't hurt to offer, and I could REALLY use the money, even if it is not much.

So Haul-it, let me know if I have committed a huge blunder here.

**EDIT**

OK, here is how I am planing on handling the book lots. I will assemble them into groups of 10 for MMPB and groups of 5 for HC and TPB. I will take pics and then package and prepay the media mail postage rate so that I can add that to the 2 dollar price. Then I will make a separate post in r/bookhaul for each lot of books with the pics and any additional information. It will be a first come first served type thing and I will not ship until payment is confirmed. (I need to find a way to do it where the transaction doesn't have a fee, if possible). I will update the post once the sale is confirmed so people don't try to keep requesting it. 

Please do not ask me for specific requests. I am not a book retailer, just a guy trying to not become a hoarder. I am selling these lots as is.

[1] http://imgur.com/hASlz 

    The Fountain of Age by Betty Friedan $6.27 US
    The Second Stage by Betty Friedan $6.16 US
    The Golden Cage; The engima of Anorexia Nervosa. $6.16 US (Free Shipping)

Got the above within a week and a half of ordering from 'Kennys' ([2] www.kennys.ie) in Ireland. *The store has free shipping on all deliveries. All three books were second hand, but in exceptional condition, also coming with a free bookmark.

Then I got this;

[3] http://imgur.com/4BaPM 

    Germaine Greer's 'Daddy We hardly Knew You' $1.00 US with $4.30 postage.

This one comes from Munnbooks in England and was ordered about a week and a half ago. Not in horrible condition for only a dollar, the only faults to be found were yellowing pages (it's an old book, so is to be expected) and the spine was faded almost completely over the books title, authors name was clearly visible.

Lastly, a delivery from Amazon; The Synaptic Self by Jospeh LeDeux, for $15.00 US. As Always with Amazon, Prompt service and arrived within 2 weeks (being in Australia and using standard international shipping, I was very pleased :)

Keeping in mind that everyone's experiences with abebooks will be different given the variety of sellers, I have had a great experience using them. And always keep an eye out for 5 star sellers.

[An Ideal Thoreau](http://imgur.com/0oiPX), A collection of works by Henry David Thoreau - Although the pages are frayed, this book is in rather fair condition and I purchased it for $8.75. There is no publication date, but judging from the [inscription](http://imgur.com/huFLN) on the inside cover, it is from 1916 or before. Here is another image of the [title page]( http://imgur.com/QVYXV).

[Whittier’s Poems]( http://imgur.com/bCJZY), A collection of works by John Greenleaf Whittier – This book was published in 1887. There are several illustrations throughout the book, so if anyone wants me to post some of them, I can do so. Otherwise, I’ll leave as is. Bought this for $14.50.

[From Sea to Sea (Vol I &amp; II)]( http://imgur.com/pg6RD) by Rudyard Kipling – Both of these come from Bridgewater College’s old library, and I suppose they got rid of them a long while ago because I found them covered in dust in an old antiques bookshop for $7.50 each. Both volumes were published in 1899. Kipling's [initials]( http://imgur.com/iQfMV) are imprinted on the front of the books.

[Poems]( http://imgur.com/q19WN) by Oscar Wilde – I found this little treasure for $30, the most expensive of the bunch, but a must have for me. Published in 1909.

If anyone is interested in knowing more about any of these books such as contents, illustrations, publishers, etc. I am happy to provide! Just let me know; It’s fun to share things that are meaningful to me with the readers of reddit! (:"	t5_2sfnu	True

1330833375.0	qgr6i	Tips to get the best book haul?	italiciguana	11	3	8	"Every year my local small town library has a fantastic used book sale. I usually get an entire year’s worth of books during my annual book haul holiday, so I take this weekend seriously.

That is why I am seeking your advice on how to boost my potential haul in any way possible. I know you all have a technique or two to ensure a good day, so I am hoping you can share! Here are the stats:

**Location:** Creswell, Oregon [10 miles outside of Eugene, Oregon]

**Time Frame:** Friday – Sunday [March 9 - 11]

* Friday - Preview sale. Admission 5 bucks. I believe you can buy at this sale, but because it is 5 bucks so I have never been, and have no idea what it is like, but it must have the same or better selection than full price day.
* Saturday - Full price day.
* Sunday - Half price day. Tends to be really picked over. Paperbacks end up being 5 for $1

**Selection:** 12,000 books, magazines, CDs, DVDs, tapes, posters, and other common library items.

**Usual Prices:** Hardcover and softcovers books $1, Paperbacks 50c, magazines 25c. Sunday is half off.

**Layout:** A community center with one large room where most of the books are featured. Romances are in a 
narrow hallway, and CDs, DVDs, and VHS tapes are in a smaller front room. The books are set on tables waist height, stacked side by side with their spines facing the sky.

**Important Note:** They usually have too many books to put out at one time. Now, they usually put the best books out first, of course, but I have seem them taking books that seem to come from nowhere when a lot of table space appears, so I usually have to go back to see what they have put out again.

**Past Hauls:** Been going for the last three years. Usually get around 20-40 books, and a few wicked posters, for $20-$30. I tend to favor historical stuff, which has good pickings, but shy away from thrillers, which drown the selections.

My current strategy is this one: have $40. Go to the sale first thing Saturday, and spend about $30. Come back Sunday and buy anything else that catches my fancy with $10. My book haul estimate in this case is: 40 books Saturday, and on Sunday get another 20-30 books. But I wonder if I should be taking at least $10 bucks to the preview sale, because I always worry that I miss out on the best books, and if I need to know any general browsing tactics.

In addition, I would also request of other book haulers to post a strategy meetup thread for bigger sales in cities, or just buddy bookhaul outings, that way we can meet and shop together to get the best haul. Might be fun!"	t5_2sfnu	True

[From Top to Bottom]:

- The Oxford Book of English Verse 1250 - 1918 (India Paper Edition), by Arthur Quiller-Couch
- On Love, by Marie-Henri Beyle Stendhal
- Books and Habits, by Lafradio Hearn, edited by John Erskine
- Poems of Robert Herrick
- Angels and Earthly Creatures, selected poems by Elinor Wylie
- The Poems of Oliver Wendell Holmes
- The Complete Poems of James Russell Lowell
- The Poems of John Godfrey Saxe
- The Complete Poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
- The Goliard Poets, translated into English verse by George F. Whicher

Total: $25.50

I shelf-read the entire bargain section of about 3,000 books in order to find these. All kinds of interesting books were hiding in nooks and places where I wasn't expecting them. Very pleasantly surprised to find all of them, and for so cheap, particularly the Oxford Book of English Verse and the Goliard Poets, which are looking to be pretty amazing collections of poetry. 

For the two non-poetry books: I grabbed On Love on the strength of Stendhal's reputation, the books' publisher (Boni &amp; Liveright) and that it looked like a beautiful treatise on love. I bought Books and Habits because John Erskine was the teacher of Mortimer J. Adler, and because the book appeared to present English literature in a very insightful way, as it was addressed to students in Japan.

Since this is my first post here, this is how I approach book-buying at used book stores or library sales: as a general rule, I don't buy paperback books, or books with dust-jackets, or books with vertical titles on the spine (this is the best indication I have found that a book has abandoned tradition, for better or worse). Physical attributes that are a good sign for what's printed on the pages: case bindings, sewn signatures, gilt edges, rough-textured cotton rag paper, unusually heavy for its size, unusually strong hinges and hinge reinforcement underneath the end-papers, thin but strong and opaque paper (India paper), a traditional colophon, comprehensive index and bibliography, symmetrical typography on the spine and title page, books that consist entirely of primary sources or translations of primary sources. I have to ignore hundreds of books to find one book that matches these criteria, but it has worked very well both in stores and online.

Some very reliable book publishers (to which I apply the criteria above): Boston Houghton-Mifflin (Riverside Press), Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Boni and Liveright, Dodd Mead &amp; Company, Alfred A. Knopf (earliest Borzoi imprint), early Yale University Press, Harcourt Brace &amp; World, early Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston."	t5_2sfnu	True
