(On a side note, this will be my last giveaway until June as I have exams coming up!)

EDIT: Questions which I feel may come up or have already came up:

Why 15th of May? - I get paid on the 14th, so need that to be able to afford the LoL Codes

P&amp;P paid for? - Yepp.


EDIT2: Added another way to get entries.

EDIT3: Someone asked about donating. Because this is such an expensive giveaway, donations will be greatly appreciated! Paypal is TheEliteGamers@hotmail.co.uk - If you add a note with your Steam name we will send you a copy of Dota2!

You can donate by going to ""Send Money"" in your Paypal Dashboard and entering our email address. - Make sure to select ""I'm sending money to family or friends"" so you are not taxed!

I posted a thread on /r/leagueoflegends earlier. It got taken down, most of the people were really nice. I understand it was against the rules, but some people straight away told me to go fuck myself and my family.

I hope getting more support here ! 

So here's my previous post !


_________________________________________________

_________________________________________________




Hello and merry christmas to everybody !

As you might know, it possible to trade a skin with someone if you get **1000 upvotes on a thread in the official forums**


I am LeyyLoo, and started playing the game around garen release.

My first champion bought was Shaco, he is also one of the champions that I played the most ( over 500 games easily ) and my alll time favourite champion. )

The first time that I saw the nutcracko skin, I was too young to afford RP by my own. But now that I can, I can't get my hands on that beautiful skin ! ):

I only have 5 days left, I need you now !

**I need every single one of you !**

Thanks in advance, and merry christmas !

**Moreover, I will give away some RP (35 euros, 6500 rp ) randomly to someone that posted in the comments if I get 1000 upvotes by December 31st 2012, i'll need your upvote !**

★ **PLEASE ! Upvote the thread in the official forums, it's what matters, I need 1000 upvotes there** ★




***★Upvote this reddit thread as well★ so the /r/lol community notices it and hopefully my dream of Nutcracko will become true ! Moreover, that's more people that might get a new present by entering the RP giveaway ! If I manage to hit the frontpage, that would be beautiful !***

**To enter the RP giveaway, post a comment in the OFFICIAL FORUMS thread !**

http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=978861

Thanks in advance for helping me ! And once again, merry christmas !

**ALSO ! If I get 1000 upvotes ( And it will be because of you guys, I'll straight up rename to REDDIT NUTCRACKO in game ! )**

EDIT 1 : Yeah ! YEAH ! 100 upvotes ! That's 1/10 through and it means  A LOT ! Thank you again everybody, I hope you guys know how much it means to me ! THANKS REDDIT &lt;3 YOU FOR LIFE 26/12/12 NEVER FORGET

EDIT 2 : Holy moly ! 200 upvotes ! That's very good ! Hopefully if we maintain this rate i'll make it towards my beautiful nutcracko ! Thanks to everybody !

EDIT 3 : 300 upvotes ! That's a good thing I guess, the bad thing is that we're only getting 100 upvotes per day average and there's only like 4 days left ! Got to go fast!

**Reminder : For the RP to be given away I need to get 1K upvotes on my EUW thread and to enter the RP giveaway you need to post a comment there and not here !**

I'm back... sort of. Well not at all really, I just want to ask a quick question and give out some of my 15,000 RP that's sitting in my now in-active account. 

Firstly I'd just like to thank everyone who wished me luck on getting my required grades for University in my last giveaway. Good news! I got in! I am now a student of Computer Games Technology at one of the best game design Universities in Europe!

---

Anyway, back to the thing you are really here for.

**How to enter:**

Simple rules this time, no ""follow"", ""subscribe"" etc. 

I do want a question answered though^(**Leave your comment below**):

* What kind of gaming YouTube content do you want to watch?
* Also just for me being curious as to what everyone wants, say what champion/skin you want me to buy for you!

Be it rage videos, chatroulette, comedy sketches, horror play-through, live-streams, Gaming News. 

*If you want, you can also go subscribe to my channel: http://www.youtube.com/TEG, starting September new videos will be posted and a regular timetable will be established*

My obvious thought is you guys want some League videos, but I will be moving in with a few of my friends when I go to University and they're going to be working with me to get my YouTube channel back up and running fully as a gaming channel; and I'm the only one out of all of us that plays League :P

Oh and a up-vote wouldn't hurt, I don't get Karma for it so shouldn't be a problem..

---

Giveaway ends Sunday noon (GMT) I will PM the winner for their Summoner name, if they are EUW I will add them and give them the skin/champion in a week or 2 (i forget how long you have to wait) **If they are not EUW I will buy them however much RP is required.** 

And before everyone puts it, **NO ULTIMATE SKINS**, that's just greedy =/

1351532836.0	12aayo	[Announcement] First come first serve giveaways	lnsentience	51	4	17	"It seems that the community is upset about people posting codes instead of creating some sort of contest. I've been hearing a lot of accusations of bots taking the code the minute it's posted (there's no proof of this actually happening). Therefore I'm adding a new rule:

**First come first serve giveaways are still allowed, but you can't post them directly. You need to 'disguise' the code and inform people.** Here's an example:

---------------

**Title:** [GIVEAWAY][NA] Riot Teemo

Body: Here's the code for Riot Teemo:

DS//SDF/JKLD//SA/F

**Remove all the backslashes before entering the code**

------------------

This way, if bots really were grabbing the code instantly, they would fail since they would not know how to retrieve the code.

---------

Another thing I'd like to mention:

People keep reporting giveaways because the person giving away the code is asking for little things like Facebook/Youtube likes and Twitch/Twitter follows. Just to be clear, this is not a form of trading. You do no lose anything by simply clicking follow/like. They are allowed to do this. On the other hand, if the user is making monetary donations a requirement for entering a giveaway, that is not allowed because you are giving money for the code (which in fact is trading). You may ask for donations, but it must not be a requirement for entering a giveaway.

**tl;dr**

* First come first serve giveaways are still allowed, but you need to 'disguise' the code. See above example.

* Users making facebook likes/twitch followers/etc a requirement before entering the giveaway is **perfectly fine**. Monetary donations are not."	t5_2uvf7	True

1347379796.0	zpppl	[Announcement] Giving away accounts, spammers, excessive reporting, etc	lnsentience	48	7	16	"This subreddit is growing very quickly and more giveaways are happening. This is awesome, but there are a few things I need to make clear.

----------------

1- Giving away League of Legends accounts is not allowed. There are just too many complications/problems that can occur with giving accounts to people.

2- You probably have noticed that I've removed the downvote button from threads and comments. This is to prevent users from downvoting other comments in the hopes that it increases their chances of winning a giveaway, and prevents the downvoting of giveaway threads to keep them off the front page. However, a lot of users are reporting comments and threads that do not break the rules in any way. Sorting through hundreds of false reports is not fun, and it prevents me from actually removing the stuff that should be removed.

3- **For the love of all that is good on this earth, please stop messaging me asking for codes.** Whenever I have extra codes, I'll make a giveaway in this subreddit. I will not, I repeat, I will not respond to anybody who sends me messages asking/begging for codes.

4- I'm sure you've all seen those spammers who post their emails begging for codes (I'd like to call them 'Email beggars'). Report those guys right away. I'm instabanning anybody who does this from now on.

-------------

**tl;dr**

1- Giving away League of Legends accounts is not allowed.

2- Only report comments/threads that break the rules.

3- Stop messaging me asking for codes. I won't respond.

4- ""Email begging"" will get you an instaban.

I have done loads of giveaways here and made so many people happy; which makes me happy :). But I am sad to say, this will be my last. At least, that's what I believe. On the 6th of this month I will be getting my grades back, meaning I either go to University or I don't. Either way, I think i'm going to be broke after a while :P - Although if I manage to find a job right away, don't think it'd be a problem to do a giveaway maybe once per month.

**EDIT:** Just noticed I accidentally bought 11 cards... **HERE'S A FREEBIE!** **MP FN WM JG ER H7** Just remove the spaces! 














---


I'm teaming up with a friend of mine to bring you this one last HOORAH! So be sure to go say thank you to him.

For this giveaway I'll be giving away 10 $10 RP Cards! That's $100 worth of RP!

For each card, there is a different way to enter.

Before we begin, please **Upvote** this post. This is costing me and my friend a bunch of money... $100 to be exact, so would be awesome if we could get this seen. 


**NOTE: YOU CAN ENTER ALL OF THEM, Sorry if that wasn't clear!**

CARD 8, 9 AND 10

**Exclusive to STEAM members**

Lately I have became somewhat of a card collector on Steam, so to feed my addiction I'm willing to give out $10 of RP to 3 people ($30 in total). To be in for a chance of winning these cards all you have to do is send me 5 cards via Steam. It can be any 5 cards for any game(or even summer cards). Giving me 5 cards will get you 1 ""ticket"" for your name to be pulled out of a hat to win the RP. For every 5 cards you give me after the initial 5, you get an additional ticket.

For example: 5 cards = 1 Ticket, 15 cards = 3 tickets. Simples.

If you are interested in this feel free to add me: [Steam ID](http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/thedjbuntin)

I might also accept other steam things such as TF2/DOTA2 Keys/Ref or Guest passes etc. Just ask me.

Someone just asked me if accept Steam Wallet. I do, but don't give me much, I am meant to be giving to you :P - For ever £0.50 Steam Wallet you get 2 tickets (£0.25 for 1)!

Optionally you can also join our Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheEliteGamersHD You won't be entered into anything for joining, just a good gesture if you decide to :)


It's not very active atm, but it might me later on.

---

Winners will be chosen from each thing. So potentially you can win $100 of RP if you are mega lucky.

Giveaway ends **MONDAY 5TH OF AUGUST**. Don't know what time, but most likely some time in the afternoon (GMT) I will message the winners, if they do not reply within 24hours, I will pick a new winner.

Good luck! and Thanks for everything :)"	t5_2uvf7	True

As always with our giveaways. There will be a winner from each social media to make sure everyone has a chance, that means **3 Winners!**

**ALL REGIONS**, If you are not on EUW we will give you enough RP to get the skin, if you on EUW, if there is enough time before it goes to full price we will gift it to you, if not, we will give you the RP!

Some people say that simply adding excessive punctuation can take care of this, however, it's very easy to tell the bot to do this on their own. My simple suggestion is to post the code as an image.

1372558527.0	1hcdjx	State of Leagueofgiving and possible ideas to improve it	Vondill	21	2	3	"I just wanted to talk about some of the problems/concerns with this subreddit and ways we could fix it. Keep in mind I am not a mod, and these are just my opinions and I welcome your thoughts/opinions on the subject. Sorry about the long post. But it's something I've been thinking about for a while.  

**Common complaints/problems**  

● Streamers using giveaways to advertise their stream  

● Streamers or websites intentionally setting minimums to how many likes/views/follows they receive before they go through with a giveaway (results in backing out of giveaways)  

● Subreddit being flooded by stream plugs  

● Not enough ""true"" giveaways (codes directly in post, generators/raffles)

First I want to address the lack of ""true"" giveaways, streamer plugs, and general activity in the subreddit. A lot of people are under the assumption that because there are so many stream giveaways, there are less true giveaways. I do not think this is true. While there is a lot more promotional giveaways nowadays than there are true giveaways, that does not necessarily mean there are less true giveaways. The overall activity in this subreddit has increased, even if most of them are stream giveaways, it does not take away from the other giveaways. I'll use myself as an example, I buy a lot of RP that I use to giveaway over my stream. If I did not stream, I would not be buying RP on a weekly basis to give away. This is the case with a lot of other people and their giveaways. But the important thing to take from it is, that myself, and others like me, do not take away from the true giveaways, we only add more activity to the subreddit. Let's say you banned streams and anyone else from promoting their content, do you think suddenly there would be more people posting codes? The truth is there wouldn't, the frequency of those posts would remain the same. I mean I guess you could argue that the other posts flood the subreddit making those other giveaways harder to see, but honestly this subreddit isn't active enough to make that a strong point. You could also argue that they just don't belong here and you don't want your X posts in the same place as your Y posts, but that just comes down to opinion. Overall I don't think it hurts anyone and isn't the real issue.

I think the bigger issue at hand isn't really the stream posts themselves, but how they are posted and the requirements some of them have. The problem comes from posts saying ""Giveaway at X followers, or giveaway at X viewers."" Then there are some that say ""Giveaway but only followers are qualified"" or ""Giveaway to those that like our facebook etc etc."" The problem comes from setting these standards so high that people can essentially ""back out"" of a giveaway if they dont hit the X number of views/likes/follows they are after. And what is a ""giveaway"" post without the giveaway? 

The lack of specifics in some of these posts is troubling as well. ""Giveaway at this stream today!"" What are you giving away? Skins? RP Codes? How many?

Another problem comes from people making posts on another person's behalf. This makes it so the person they are posting about is essentially not responsible for the giveaway at all, since they are not the ones posting it or announcing the giveaway. What if that person isn't really doing a giveaway? People can be tricked under the assumption there is a giveaway only to have wasted their time.

Now I have been guilty of requiring people to follow my stream in order to qualify for a giveaway (though I would usually remind them they do not need to stay followed.) I never ask for a certain number of followers/viewers. I realized in the end it doesn't matter if you follow or not, as long as you take the time to check out the stream. I personally no longer require anything for my giveaways, all you need to do is be there at the time I give out the password to enter the raffle. You can argue that I'm still asking for too much, that people shouldn't have to watch my stream for a chance at a giveaway, and that's fine. But let's be honest here, you don't have to watch the stream, or any stream for giveaways, it's just extra incentive to check out a new stream. A lot of new streamers have a lot of trouble gaining momentum or viewers at all, but that's another subject for another time. 

Anyways let's say it's a standard one of my giveaways, I giveaway 3 cards regardless of the amount of viewers/follows whatever. I don't list the exact time of the giveaway because if I did it would just attract more bots/multiple accounts. 

There was a time when people posted codes in this subreddit only to have them almost instantly taken by bots. And every now in then you get a nice flood of riot codes from live events that would otherwise expire if they are not at least given out.

**Now the way I see it there are two options:**

**1.) Completely ban promotional posts in nature, making everything only ""true giveaways.""**  

● This would clean up this subreddit a lot, and every giveaway would be a simple post of a code (see the sidebar for more information on disguising codes from bots) or some other creative way to give something out that would not require views/likes/follows or anything other than maybe a post in the giveaway thread itself (such as guessing a number.) However, the activity on this subreddit would drop significantly, new posts would be few and far between.

**2). Add new rules and requirements to all ""promotional giveaways""**    

● This would keep the way the subreddit is now, but with more regulation and no way to back out of giveaways or delay them.

**These are the rules I would recommend:**  
● The person doing the giveaway must be the same person making the giveaway post.  

● Can no longer require X amount of follows/likes/views etc in order to do giveaway. People can no longer back out of doing the giveaway if they do not reach their goals.  

● Giveaway must be specifically detailed in the post. Giving out a skin? What kind? How many? Giving out RP? What is the value of the RP Card(s) you are giving out?  
**Example:** ""Hi im streaming and giving out one $10 rp card today."" or ""Check out my stream I will be giving out two Riot Graves skin codes during the stream!""  

● Giveaways must be required to be given out before the streamer goes offline.  

● No more like my page/websites. They cannot be tracked well enough and there's no way of knowing if they actually follow through with their promises. Leave those to spamming public chat rooms in the client. It's too easy to lie and say you'll give something out and just not end up doing it. At least streamers can be reported.

**TLDR:** Subreddit has problems with possible solutions. Read the post. Sorry it's so long.

I prefer option 2 so we still have frequent activity. But I think something needs to be done regardless. We can't leave this place the way it is now. So we need to reach a decision on either add some new rules or remove promotional giveaways all together. Once again these are just my opinions. I hope we can have a nice discussion on the subject and possibly reach a decision on how we're going to improve leagueofgiving. Thank you for reading!

I made a Thread in the EUW-lol forums to try to get enough upvotes to trade a skin for redcard katarina with a friendly guy that already offered me his skin.

http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=9631571#post9631571
(that's my thread in the german forums, same rules, giveaway counts for both treaths so double chances if you vote+post in both, created there as well cause you only need +500 votes there)

The problem is that you need +1000/+500 votes there so please upvote my Thread, I'll choose around 3-5 guys (maybe more, but at least 3-5) random summoner from each thread and they can choose which X-mas skin they want. I will gift them with the new gifting system.

So please, Upvote my threads and good luck for that giveaway.
Inspired to create a reddit thread by Fancy Panda, good luck for your skin.

Edit: I just got the information (thanks Tensaika) that you need to have the summoner in your friendlist BEFORE the Snowdown Showdown starts to be able to gift them skins, so feel free to add me ingame and say me that you added me for the giveaway. I'll choose the winners from my friendlist then.

GLHF all with your joke telling!

Edit: Okay, 24 hours are up now. I'm gonna close the thread and read through all of the jokes. The winners will be contacted by me through reddit. Thank you all for participating, I really enjoyed your jokes and I hope you guys had as much fun telling jokes as I did reading them. Peace y'all

1354365940.0	143nk7	[GIVEAWAY] Brokenshard giving back!	Drianus	19	5	72	"Hey guys. Many of you may know me but for those who don't I'll give a proper introduction.
My name is Ram Djemal, better known on the EUW server as Brokenshard. I've played Jungler for many teams such as Luna Gaming, ESC Gaming, AL.Omega, and IWC. My peak at season 2 was 2368 elo and in pre-season 3 its 2192 (damnit ._.). A few weeks ago, I had a serious lung condition that required me to take a treatment that would cost around 1000 USD. My insurance company for whatever reason refused to pay the cost. So pretty much, I was in a dump. I didn't want to ask my mom to fork over even more money, since after my father passed away money was incredibly tight.

So, I came to reddit for support. And through all the shit I got or people claming it was fake, I managed to raise excactly 1236 Euros. Thats 350 euros more than I ever needed to pay for my treatment. I also promised on the post that I would give back to the community if I could. Now I can. And I will.
I thought about many things I could do with the money, and the most obvious (and simplest) would be to just give them to people as a prize in equivalent RP, which made sense, this is league of legends anyhow! So this is a thank you, to the unspoken heroes of r/lol, the heroes that together saved me. This is me saying thank you.. Now on to the prizes!

What I have for you: 350 euros worth of RP, by the end of the day I will have chosen 7 people to receive 50 euros each. I want to make it as fair as possible, and what is more unbiased than chance itself?
Throughout the day, you can view my stream: twitch.tv/brokenshardeuw with an adblock on, since I wont be spamming ads. And after a pre-determined interval, I'll ask people to write a certain piece of information down, and the first to write it down will win the prize. For example, I might ask to write a number down between 1 and 100,000, and the first to write it will win. Thats just an example. It will be either done in my twitch chat, league of legends client, but I figured that not everyone would have a twitch account, or an EUW account. So the first prize will be given out now, if you don't have a twitch account its really simple to make one.
7 50 EURO RP PRIZES LEFT:

COMPETITION 1 IS CHANGED - I randomly chose a number between 1 and 100.000. Closest one to guess the *number wins.
(NOTE: EVERY PRIZE AFTER THIS ONE WILL BE DONE ON TWITCH CHAT, SO PLEASE MAKE AN ACCOUNT.)

BIG EDIT: The 1st prize giveaway will be a 1 hour long tournament, so get as many answers in (1 per person)

* The competition is changed becuase we had to re-post and some people got here faster then the original posters.

Stream - twitch.tv/brokenshardeuw

I am giving away a $10 RP Code Giveaway. All you have to do is fill out this survey (It's just for some fun statistics. It costs nothing, and it is League of Legends related. If this survey is not allowed, moderators please let me know, I make NO money from this survey at all however. I just get some fun statistics that I hope to later post on reddit and the League forums.)

I will pick a random summoner on Thursday, April 25th. Not sure what time of day.

Here is the survey link: http://www.surveypie.com/survey102152

Good luck summoners! 

edit: I posted this on the NA League forums, for those interested, here is the link: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36834337

edit 2: The statistics will be posted the same day as the winner, or maybe the day after. Your best bet is to keep an eye on this link for my post: http://www.reddit.com/user/Waizujin/submitted/

edit 3: I have setup a website for the giveaways! Well, more a blog, but it's here anyway: http://www.leaguegiveaways.com/ This will be your best bet for finding information on future giveaways, finding out who won, checking the survey statistics and more. If the website does not load, please check back later, I just bought the domain and everything so it might take a while for your DNS to propagate. "	t5_2uvf7	True

1363317515.0	1abv4e	I am disappointed...	fwho	19	5	10	"The only reason I subscribed to this subreddit is because I had planned on giving away LoL codes from time to time. I never had any plans on attaching ""Like Me"" strings, but a quick scroll through some of the posts has a lot of bitching and complaining. So what if someone asks for you to follow them, its not like you cannot unfollow or unlike... Its not permanent. Beyond that, if you actually want more than just the very, very random person who somehow gets a card they dont want &gt; doesnt give it away to friends &gt; on another board / website &gt; manages to somehow find this tiny subreddit &gt; then be kind enough to gift it, to actually give away codes, you might want to reconsider your stance. People will giveaway more, if they get something they want in return, despite how insignificant it is. And I hate to tell you, a Like, Follow, or Subscribe is not significant... With that being said, I wont be giving anything away here simply because of the whining and ungrateful attitudes."	t5_2uvf7	True

At the office many of us can't stop talking about League of Legends, so we're trying to start up a little community to share original content, YouTube videos, and more. So why not get the ball rolling with a contest!

How can you participate? It’s simple, quick, and free! First, create an account on Ology and follow the [League of Legends ology](http://www.ology.com/ology/78751/league-of-legends). Then just create a post and tell us your idea for a new champion skin. We judge submissions based on three things:

* How well the skin works with the champion. Making Teemo a bowling ball wouldn't work to well, but Rammus could be interesting!

* How well the skin works with the champions moves. Try to think up something that works with everything! If you have a great idea but it only works with a couple moves, definitely submit it (for instance Bowling Ball Rammus's Q plays a strike sound and little pins fly around when he hits an enemy, but don't know what the rest of the moves would be). However if your idea is neck-and-neck for first place, the most fleshed-out skin will win the grand prize!

* Artwork! Not everyone's an artist, we get that. However we'd love to see some original renditions of your new skin! Everything from a doodle to a mural will boost your chances of winning, but a good drawing wont necessarily bring you the grand prize by itself. Make sure your idea follows #1 and #2 as well! Note: If your submission uses existing artwork, it will not count. We want new ideas, not just descriptions of existing ones!

* Make sure you tell us your summoner name! If you make an account on Ology with Facebook, Twitter, or email we may be able to contact you, but the only way to ensure you get your prize is by posting your summoner name along with your submission.

**This contest officially runs from today (April 2nd) to April 19th, so post sooner than later!**

Prizes:

1 Grand Prize winner will get his choice from ANY skin available in the store

2 Runner Ups will get their choice of any skin in the store below legendary (975rp)

3 Honorable Mentions will get any skin in the store 520rp and below

...and one contestant with the best entry without artwork will win a Riot Graves card, so use your literary prowess to impress us!

We hope you like this, and if it goes well we'll be sure to do this again!

(Note: Once the contest ends, all prizes must be claimed within 30 days or they are forfeited. We will contact winners when they are chosen and again if they have not claimed a prize 20 days after the contest ends.)"	t5_2uvf7	True

1366901818.0	1d33cj	[Meta] I propose a change; After a winner has been chosen and before the prize is gifted the winner must post to the giveaway thread. After that the giveaway is marked as NSFW signifying the contest is over.	zedbra	18	7	2	" I know I am complaining about free stuff. I think we all agree that this subreddit has turned into ""Give me views/likes/shares/subscribes and I will give RP/Skins!"" I am not trying to call out anyone in specific , but it is easy to walk about with 50-100 new hits and to not give anything away.

This would also increase the giveaways to active users of this subreddit since the winner must check his inbox and post to the thread.

I really enjoyed being involved in the community. Because of this I am looking to start another weekly fun thing. Every friday I would like to start an interactive stream where I go live get some viewers and talk and play with them. I will get rp cards and host aram games to give them away.
If i get some responses this will start tomorrow with a 24 hour stream marathon along with a good amount of codes.

at DHW12 I managed to get a riot Graves code, used it on EUW, gave it to my friend to activate it on EUNE. After that I tore it apart and threw away. Luckily I remembered in time that it can be activated on NA as well :) I'm not sure, but perhaps it can be activated on other servers like BR, TK, KR.

Soooo, what's your favorite movie and why. Comment I find most interesting will win (even if I saw that movie). Don't forget to specify your region, as I said, maybe the code will work.



Best regards,

1354636656.0	149l2y	[GIVEAWAY] Giving away stuffs for every server after.... (see inside)	Valenash	13	3	445	"Hi everyone, I'm Valenash and i am pretty known on /r/Lolcodetrade since i am one of the most trusted traders there, with over 20 confirmed trades (probably even more, but i forgot to report some of them).
After thinking about doing a giveaway for a lot of time, i finally decided to ask you a little pleasure, and then to give back with a giveaway.

**When will i do the giveaway?**
This is pretty easy. I'm actually playing a game for iPad (and iPhone/other devices you can use app on) called Guardian Cross. I need some referrals to get nice prizes in the game, the only thing you have to do to make a referral for me is to download the app, register and insert in the right place my invitation code that is FW95976.
After getting 10 referrals on that game, i will choose the winners.

**What am i going to give away?**
I want to give to you guys a stuff for every server, i have some codes and i will randomly decide which one i will give you if you win.
The code could be a riot graves, a nightmare cho gath, a samurai yi, a riot nasus or some xp boosts.

**How could you win?**
I will think a number between 1 and 1000. Write in the comments a number and your server, the guys who will guess the number or will guess the closest number to the one i tought will win the prize for their server. **REMEMBER** to write also the server you play on.

Good luck to everyone and thank you :)

EDIT: i decided to change a little bit conditions. I think it is fair to give a little bit higher chance to win to people who will make a referral for me.. so, for the ones who will do, message me in game (my Guardian Cross nickname is Valenash) with your reddit nick and after checking you did it you will be allowed to post TWO guesses for the number ;)

EDIT 2: Seyrou has been the first one to make a referral, i need 9 more before doing the giveaway.. :)
A big thanks to you, and good luck twice :D

EDIT 3: I have three referrals at the moment. Remember to send me a pm in game to have the second chance to win the code, otherwise i can't know who you are :)
Just need seven more of you to download the app with my refer to give codes to the guys who will guess the number :)

EDIT 4: I'm gonna be out for most of the we, but i still need 6 referrals to be done.. c'mon guys, it just takes 2 mins :)
And you know, no referrals no party, so.. i hope that when i will be b home i'll find thousands of them!! :D
so i'll be happy to give away what i promised ;)

EDIT 5: **since i am still at just 6 referrals, and time is passing, i decided to do the giveaway in any case for christmas (if i will be able to recover data from my broken pc :(:(...
I will be away the next whole week, but i hope in the while someone kind enough will make for me ATLEAST another referral :(**


**THE LUCKY NUMBER WAS 667!! I WILL PM THE WINNERS WITH THEIR PRIZES IN THE NEXT DAYS :)**"	t5_2uvf7	True

I hope you'll take the time to take a look at a unique stream I am trying to create for the community.

My name is Mylixia and I stream strategy and decision-based games like League of Legends, Starcraft and many other RTS/MMO games. I'm currently a Gold V player in League.

At www.twitch.tv/mylixia our small community emphasizes positive development through gaming and viewer interaction. We do viewer normal games almost every day, as well as ranked games with commentary and discussion. Every question or comment you make will be responded to in some way, and we have fantastic players of all levels of skill in the chat who also offer their invaluable advice on the game - the wide majority of whom are vastly better players than myself.

Please check us out and chat, I work really hard to make it a unique, viewer-centric experience.

I got a **Riot K-9 Nasus,Riot Graves** or **Full Metal Rammus** to giveaway. 

The reason being that I just want to give back to the community. Simple as that. 

To make it fair, I don't want to do it in a first come, first serve basis.

* Bring out your **OP** MSPaint skills
* Draw that Champ
* Post your beautiful works of art in the comments, along with what skin you want.

I'll choose 3 of the drawings tomorrow at 22:00 GMT and send the codes through PM's.

"	Mordraken	16	5	382	"EDIT: *Ok, so it seems as though the codes I got at MLG Dallas can only be used* **once**. *Not once per region. I'm really sorry guys, but I'll be going to another Event this coming weekend and will try to nab a few more to give away.*

*I believe at least one of the codes that I sent (via PM) should've been redeemed.*

*The 3 numbers were 11, 21, and 4.*


---------------------

Not just going to post the codes here.

I'm thinking of 3 numbers between 0-100, the first three people to guess them get the codes.

Include your region in your guess, please.

Sorry It took me so long. I was out of town attending the Event, and had to drive back this morning. I'm sending out the codes to the winners now.

1368886865.0	1eks5h	[GIVEAWAY] Vondill Drunk Stream Giveaway #2 Later Today!	OneManArmy77	13	5	16	"Hey guys, Vondill is going to do another Drunk Stream Giveaway, probably around 6pm PST (he hasn't announced when)! http://www.twitch.tv/vondill_

In case you might not know, Vondill is a Diamond IV Top laner. He loves to play a wide array of champs, but he often will play zac top lane as of recent. He is a funny streamer, who loves to interact with his viewers. He will often play ARAM games with as many of the viewers as he can. He is also a featured streamer on this subreddit, as indicated by his presence on the list. 

Today, he will be giving away an undisclosed amount of codes, but a rough estimate would be around **$100 in RP codes**. last time he did it, he gave away 200, so it might be even more. 

To erase even more doubt, the giveaways are **NO STRINGS ATTACHED**. that means that there is no 600 followers requirement, no 300 viewers requirement, no sharing on facebook. All you have to do to win is come into chat, follow his stream (necessary for the drawing), and wait until he puts the pw to enter the drawing in chat. From there, he will use the twitch giveaway program to randomly select a viewer, and if you are following, he will pm you the code over twitch. Once again, the giveaways are completely random and everyone has a completely equal chance to win (mods do not receive bonus chances and no favoritism)

Please come out and support him! if you enjoyed the stream, please feel free to donate, as the money goes directly towards buying more codes to give out. If you see me in chat, please feel free to talk to me, i dont bite :P

EDIT1: Stream should start in another 2 hours! Once again, no strings attached and everyone has equal chance to win!

EDIT2: Going live very soon! Stay tuned"	t5_2uvf7	True

The only updates from now on will be completing the table, no more of these updates. Well done to all those who win, and still good luck to anyone who wins because someone doesn't reply! Thanks for taking part!**

LATEST LATEST LATEST EDIT: Updated table. Facebook has still no winner. Check yer damn inboxes. 2 steam winners have been messaged(both offline messages) so will update when they reply. The last card (card 10) is delayed until tomorrow morning (GMT, 8th of August) due to demand. But WILL NOT be delayed any more after that.

LATEST LATEST EDIT: Alright, updating the table in couple minutes. Had a very busy day with only 2 hours of sleep the night before, so I am off after this again. *Sorry to say but because of that the Steam giveaway is postponed another day*, really sorry, but I am far too tired right now, sore head etc and now most of my Uni stuff is out of the way I just want to go to sleep. Just another update to this after going through those messages. Either they are damn afraid of the spam or they just want to remain private just because. I'm thinking is the former, considering last time I announced a winner publicly(Facebook) they got messaged and abuse for being a ""fake account"" to enter the giveaway and the rest of the people were begging her for the code..., even though I added her myself and checked her history to confirm. Shouldn't have to say this, but don't message winners begging for their codes. It's really quite sad that I can't link some guys and say they won and you guys either just say congrats or ignore it.


LATEST EDIT: Woke up. Got results. 1 grade below what I needed for a subject, but over-achieved in 2 other subjects. Got rejection email. Phoned University, got accepted. FUCK YEA! Not that many of you will really care :P. Anyway, I under-estimated how much work I need to do this morning, fees, acceptance, completing tracking, signing stuff to say I am leaving my old school etc etc etc. So I won't update this thread until at least 5pm GMT, but don't expect it to be done until later tonight. Just depends how busy I am. Good luck to you and hope you guys have won!





Reminder for this post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfGiving/comments/1jkyng/huge_giveaway_10_10_rp_cards/ please go there to get the rules and how to enter.

**Update to the giveaway:** All winners will be messaged around **22:00 GMT TODAY** apart from the STEAM winners. The 3 cards for the Steam giveaway will be given away tomorrow due to several requests to prolong the giveaway until tomorrow.

And because of the amazing response to it I decided i want to splash out this Easter and make someone else's day!

---

**So here's the deal:**

If [**this livestream**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70CilRBFvA) gets 100 viewers at once **or** 200 likes before it ends I will run down to a shop in my town which sells RP cards &amp; Skin codes and get a requested code.

---

**What you have to do to enter:**

1. Go to [**the stream**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70CilRBFvA)

2. ""Like"" the stream

3. Comment on the [latest status posted on our FB](http://www.facebook.com/TheEliteGamers) (the status which links to the stream) with what you want to win **AND** your YouTube name!(Selection below)

4. Simply watch the stream **and comment** on the gameplay/discuss stuff in comments, do whatever; however, spamming and asking^begging for codes will make you disqualified.

**Each comment is an entry!** So if you stay for full stream commenting all the way through you have much larger chance than 1 comment!

When the stream ends: I will www.random.org a number, and scroll down comments counting each one until I reach that number. I will then run to shop, get that code and then message the winner and wait until he/she has used the code and then I will announce the winner in comments below + in comments on stream! (And post the code in comments for a first come first serve for the other servers)


---

Selection:

* £10 RP Card (if you pick this I will pick two winners)
* £25 RP Card
* Arcade Sona
* Riot Graves
* Champion Starter Pack
* Full Metal Rammus
* Riot Singed (maybe, not 100% sure if it still has them)
* PAX Sivir

---

**EDIT:** Changed number **3** to that you need to post what you want on our Facebook - Reason is people living in Germany are blocked from the channel! Sorry for inconvenience!

**EDIT2:** Stream bugged out, we were using the new *beta* 1080p stream and found a bug. Updated link with new stream.

**EDIT3:** Because I messed up the first stream *(ooops)* and lost us 26 likes, i removed the time limit on this, I will just buy the code tomorrow if the store is closed.

Pouncival here!  Some of you may know me, but most of you probably do not.  For those of you unfamiliar, I used to stream very regularly every 6 months, but suddenly had to stop.  I'm back, and really excited to be able to stream League for you all again.  It's been tough building my audience back again, but a summoner named MindTriX stumbled upon my channel and told me to come here since I do pretty regular giveaways.  He has actually been a great help in promoting my channel and has shared his giveaway method with me, which is much more efficient.


**My Stream:** http://www.twitch.tv/pouncivalgaming


**What You Get:** If you're looking for a very laid back, fun, entertaining (and maybe even educational) League of Legends stream, you have come to the right place! Enjoy the chill music and League of Legends with me!  Gaming is my passion and I do this because I love to play and I love League.  It's truly a privilege to be able to share my passion with my viewers out there, and giveaways are my way of saying thank you for sharing this experience with me.


**The Giveaways:** Following my good friend MindTriX's model, I will me giving away RP every 200 followers.  If you want to enter the drawings, all you need to do is be sure to follow my channel and be in the chat watching when I do the drawings.  That's it!  Once we hit the follower mark, it's RP time!  In the future I think I will just be gifting skins/champs/RP to people, but I have a few RP cards saved up so I'm going through them first.


**More Pouncival:** If you're enjoying the stream, great!  You might enjoy my Youtube channel where I upload some of the best and worst bits of the stream in a series called Chronicles of the Bronze League.  There are also some Let's Plays on there if that's more your thing!  Feel free to like me on Facebook, too.  I don't use it much now, but if it takes off, I probably will.

Hello Friends,

I am ThatsNotMyLane and I want you to come watch me play League of Legends.

&gt;""But TNML, why the hell would I want to watch you play LoL when I could just play myself, I'm probably better than you anyway.""

Thanks for asking hypothetical skeptical internet person! There are a few reasons why tuning into my stream is always a good idea. First of all, Its super entertaining, I promise you that, you can expect myself and my gang of miscreants (The LoL Stars) to partake in all manner of shenanigans in our LoL games. Also, I'm gold 5 so that means theres a 90% chance I AM better than you.

&gt;""Ok, I still still skeptical, what else you got for me""

I'll give you free stuff.

&gt;""Siiiiiick I love free stuff!""

Damn straight you do! Just watch me every week and your simple preseance will give you a chance to win free, thats right FREE, Riot Points!

So go to this link and check it out:

So after failing to sell it locally I've decided I will give it away to people who follow my ""company"".

Hi! I am Joe, aka Monstro. Liam is my sarcastic English pal who makes me feel small whenever I ""disappoint"" him by making a totally boneheaded play like I do... every game? To apologize to poor Liam I've created Twitter hashtag #sorryliam to chronicle all of my horrible league mistakes so that through my public shame I might learn from my mistakes and be forgiven by my Monocle-wearing, tea-sipping cohort. Help me apologize by airing your own LoL follies! Everyone has a friend like Liam: shaming them into improving their skills, which is what my blog - allMIA - is all about!! To get the word out about my humble little blog I thought I'd invite the community to participate in a simple, fun contest which should result in some good laughs for everyone involved. 

The contest is simple as described in the image post - I will monitor #sorryliam on Twitter for the next 48(ish) hours and on Wednesday the 13th I will choose 3 great tweets and award the winners 650 RP each. Originally the plan was to use the gift system until I recalled Riot's friends list restriction, so in the interest of expediting your award I will instead purchase RP cards and DM the codes to the winners on Twitter.

 For simplicity: since this is my first try at this the contest is only open to summoners with accounts on the NA server. If the contest goes well, next time I will work out a way to extend it to other regions. All entries agree to possibly have their #sorryliam tweets featured in a future article on http://www.allmia.wordpress.com

1348016155.0	1040da	"My ""Welcome to the mod team"" 24 hour Challenge + Arcade Sona Giveaway. "	Triggs390	13	6	42	"Hello everyone!

Before I became a mod on r/leagueoflegends when arcade Sona was rumored to be just a PAX skin, I posted that I am going to PAX Prime and would try to get some extra skins for you folks. Well, OP delivers now.

I have two unused sona codes. I know they are available on NA but I've heard rumors of players having trouble getting them on EU without a picture of the actual code. I will provide a picture of the code but just as a general warning I can not guarantee that RIOT staff will approve the code on your account. I got bored of just the ""pick a random comment"" threads, so the mod team and I thought of a cool little challenge.

The Challenge:

You are to create a 1v5 bot game on summoners rift using blind pick. The person who can win the game the fastest and post a screenshot will win.

**The rules are:

    You have to be the only real player in the game.
    The team comp of the other team must be: Wukong, Shen, Annie, Graves, Taric.
    To make it fair for everyone, you can only pick from THIS weeks free champions.
    The map must be summoners rift.

EDIT: 5. Apparently team comp doesn't show up in postgame screen shots, so you must include a screenshot of the tab screen right before you win the game (meaning you're attacking the nexus). So your submission should have two screenshots (postgame and tab.)

You are allowed as many attempts as you want as long as you follow these rules.** Please submit your screenshot (just one) by 930AM PST tomorrow 9/19/2012 and include your region with the time in brackets to make it easier for me to scan through. If you submit your screenshot and then get a faster time, feel free to change your submission. I will give the top two times in each region a code. (Again, remembering the disclaimer on EU codes.)

Please re submit your screenshots. 

Good luck.

**Submissions posted after 9:30AM PST will not be accepted, it will take me a little while to go over the results and give codes to the winners so please be patient.** 

**Winners announced:**

**For NA we have Sliced-_- with 9:47 and LeComeAtme with 9:54**
**For EUW we have Mirjang 9:36 and Ahrier with 9:44**
**And for EUNE (Which only had three submissions) we have raducojaocaru at 10:32 and Reaver at 14:05**

**I will be sending codes shortly! Thanks everyone for trying and thanks for the laughs with the fail stories.**


**Codes sent!**"	t5_2uvf7	True
1347950487.0	102h4b	Buddha's stream give away- 5 $10 RP Cards@150 viewers- Tomorrow @4:30pm PST	dcLookAtThis	11	6	14	"Hey everyone I just wanted to get this on Reddit for my give away that I am doing tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:30pm PST on my stream @ www.twitch.tv/insane521


So the big ploy with me going out and doing this give away is I wanna try and reach as many people as possible since I have been focusing on my streaming a lot more as of late, an focusing on my commentary to help people learn and also enjoy watching my stream.


A Bit about what you can expect can be 1800~ Mid/Support/Jungle Solo queue games from my stream, where I explain my thought process and just overall game sense on what is going in game to help people get a better understanding of the game. And usually at the end of the day I hop in ARAM's with my viewers to have a good time with people who watch my stream. If you're wondering what an average day in my stream looks like here is a clip from a few days ago. http://www.twitch.tv/insane521/b/332336233

So this brings me to my final point, tomorrow(September 18) at 4:30pm PST I will start streaming with the hopes of reaching 150 viewers, once I reach this goal I'll hop in some ARAMS with the viewers and start doing giveaway's and whatnot. I hope you guys all are able to stop by and check out the stream and hopefully you guys enjoy what content I put out there for you, if not come by for a chance to try and win some RP.

Thanks for reading and here is proof of the cards for those bound to ask http://i.imgur.com/XBlsW.jpg

*University of Washington*

*And others*

**We will be broadcasting through TwitchTV starting 12PM PST: http://twitch.tv/CollegiateLoL**

**They're also all redeemed on NA**, I scratched some out to differentiate the used from the non-used, but I completely forgot about how these codes aren't region locked (so if i made a typo, just ask again. If somehow it doesn't work... I apologize).

I will chose the winners in about **4-5 HOURS** I need to give them out early because of their expiration, and 4 hours is good time for me. sorry ._.

you will have ownership of the code when i give them out, I'm not gonna give the same code out to someone else in a diff region because of the troubles that may occur. You decide if you want to give it out in the comments or something

EDIT: they have been used on NA

EDIT: Closing within 30 mins~

EDIT: so many alternate accounts and accounts made just for giveaways... so far half are from random.org...im hand picking the other half"	t5_2uvf7	True

CURRENTLY LIVE

Hi Guys and Gals, 

Saturday, April 20, 2013 [3pm and 4pm Mountain time](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20130420T15&amp;p1=1243&amp;ah=1) I will be giving away one of my $10 RP cards on stream. All you have to do, is come watch. Is this basically me trying to buy you into watching my stream? Yes. Do you really care that much? You shouldn't its free RP! Holy Batman, that's awesome!!!

Hell, maybe you could even try listening/watching and maybe you'll like what you hear/see. I try to always be informative in order to make things interesting. Or, you could just get some free RP, all good.

Also I'm gold 5, in case you are wondering about that.

Additionally for clarification, the giveaway will be done randomly through the use of the twitch giveaway plugin.

As it turns out it was a raging success. I had a great time talking and playing with the people that showed up. in just the 24 hours we managed get get over 1k views.

I'm looking to do it again this week. However this week will not be 24 hours. Playing the game for that long really killed me and i dont know if i could do it again. This week will also feature less cards. instead of the 5 from last week I will probably do more like 3. 

I'm looking forward to doing it again this week and im really hoping to be able to get 50 viewers this week. "	t5_2uvf7	True

I had made a post yesterday about doing a weekly stream with ARAM giveaways and just general interactivity. I said that if it was received well i would kick it off this week with a 24 hour stream with giveaways. Well it did well so here i am. 

I will make it live in about 10 minutes with music and the usual stream stuff. I have 5 10$ cards to give away. I will try my best to spread the giveaways out over the 24 hours to accomidate any latecomers. The giveaways will be in an ARAM format where the community(viewers) decide who is the most deserving. The first 3 the password will be given in twitch chat. For the final 2 however the password will be posted to my twitter page @7he_Doctor.  

Out side of the 5 giveaway ARAMs i will be generally duoqing with a friend of mine and if people want, we will probably play some normals with people. As the night goes on i will probably do more games with the viewers

If anyone wants to use mumble for ARAMs that is an option as we use it quite regularly.

Hi, I am not a LOL player but I got these two free codes at GDC last week and I thought someone could benefit from them. It says they expire 5 days after the event so it is soon if they aren't all ready. If they don't work I am sorry; I forgot about them until a few minutes ago. First person to message me gets first pick second gets what is left over. I was told to post it here so if this isn't the correct way to do this I am sorry.

1360004364.0	17vpj4	[GIVEAWAY][EUW] I am giving away some skin codes on my stream for the best LoL jokes.	DameHixxi	7	3	11	"Hey guys,

So I have three skin codes to give away, yay.

The skins are as follows:

1 x Riot K-9 Nasus
2 x PAX Sivir

Do you want a free skin? I am metaphorically dangling these above your head as we speak. But how does one obtain such a gift? Well community, being female and all, I require attention from anonymous online strangers. I can literally suck the essence from across the oceans of time and space as long as you tune into my stream.

[B][I]BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.[/I][/B]

Sadly for you I am about as physically attractive as Ryze after a night out with Gragas and Teemo at one of Tryndamere's famous Freljord tea parties. As I hear this is a key point in getting viewers and maintaining my supply of internet folk to subtly drain down I must turn to other methods. Smearing make up on my face doesn't seem to help, dammit.

So with this in mind I am inviting you, community, to take your best shot at me. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right?

Submit your best League jokes to win skins in chat. Things you should know:

1. These skins are only redeemable on EUW.

2. If I am playing League (badly, might get drunk) I probably won't be reading chat so best save any good ones for when I am paying attention.

Hello Friends,

I am ThatsNotMyLane and I want you to come watch me play League of Legends.

&gt;""But TNML, why the hell would I want to watch you play LoL when I could just play myself, I'm probably better than you anyway.""

Thanks for asking hypothetical skeptical internet person! There are a few reasons why tuning into my stream is always a good idea. First of all, Its super entertaining, I promise you that, you can expect myself and my gang of miscreants (The LoL Stars) to partake in all manner of shenanigans in our LoL games. Also, I'm gold 5 so that means theres a 90% chance I AM better than you.

&gt;""Ok, I still still skeptical, what else you got for me""

I'll give you free stuff.

&gt;""Siiiiiick I love free stuff!""

Damn straight you do! Just watch me every week and your simple preseance will give you a chance to win free, thats right FREE, Riot Points!

quick note, it hasnt started, but is almost certainly going to. check in around 6 or 7 for east coast, 3 or 4 for west coast. he may start later though

Im doing this to partially annoy him as i am a frequent stream follower, but i suggest that if you like rp cards, a fun twitch chat or a watching a cool dude feed his way to (hopefully) Plat V, then i suggest you stop on by. He normally gives away $30 in $10 cards randomly throughout his stream session. If you want to do some math on your chances of winning, the stream has never broken 100 viewers, so it's 1/90 chance *3 for the amount of cards, coming out to about 4% of you winning. That 90 people is a conservative guess as the normal amount of people that enter are around 60ish, so the 4% is lowballing it. Anyway, please drop on by, and tell vondill OneManArmy77 sent you :P

1359441614.0	17hfot	[Giveaway][NA or ALL] Giving away up to $100 of RP on my stream. Details inside!	Mullly	7	5	2	"So first of all let me say that I have done giveaways before and many people enjoyed the stream and stuck around and avidly watched even after the giveaways were over. I had a nice viewer base, but then quit for 6 months and lost many of them except for a few true fans. I want to get back into streaming and providing entertainment for people so I am doing this giveaway to boost my viewer base up a bit!

If RP cards purchased in the US will work for any region, then this giveaway is for everyone. If not then it will just be for NA.

I will giveaway a $50 RP card when i reach 100 viewers on my stream. After I have reached 100 viewers, I will then begin a new giveaway that is a bit more complicated. Basically what i will do is ask people to promote my stream if they wish to do so and if someone comes to my stream and enjoys, they send me a message saying who brought them to the stream. If I get to 300 concurrent viewers and become a twitch.tv partner, I will give the person with the most people brought to my stream $50 RP or maybe even $100! Haven't decided yet, but it is a HUGE deal to me so it will probably be $100. I will basically keep a chart of names to keep tabs on how many people they have referred. Waiting until I have 300 concurrent viewers and a partnership will eliminate the possibility of someone creating many accounts to get themselves the prize.

The stream is www.twitch.tv/mullly  -- I usually stream on Mondays from 5:00pm - 4:00 am, Tuesdays 7:30pm - 4:00 am, Wednesdays (same time as mondays) and Thurs - Sunday depends on my work schedule but always from midnight - 5:00am. All time are EST.

I am ~1500 top lane main, but I play everything at about the same level. I also do guides for my youtube channel @ www.youtube.com/MullyLoL so if you want to check that out to see if you would enjoy the stream you can do that. I have been paid for many of these guides videos so I am already experienced and accepted as an educator of League of Legends so hopefully that gives some incentive to come watch and possibly learn some things.

Hello Friends,

I am ThatsNotMyLane and I want you to come watch me play League of Legends.

&gt;""But TNML, why the hell would I want to watch you play LoL when I could just play myself, I'm probably better than you anyway.""

Thanks for asking hypothetical skeptical internet person! There are a few reasons why tuning into my stream is always a good idea. First of all, Its super entertaining, I promise you that, you can expect myself and my gang of miscreants (The LoL Stars) to partake in all manner of shenanigans in our LoL games. Also, I'm gold 4 so that means theres a 90% chance I AM better than you. 

&gt;""Ok, I still still skeptical, what else you got for me""

I'll give you free stuff.

&gt;""Siiiiiick I love free stuff!""

Damn straight you do! Just watch me every week and your simple preseance will give you a chance to win free, thats right FREE, Riot Points!

Hello Friends,

I am ThatsNotMyLane and I want you to come watch me play League of Legends.

&gt;""But TNML, why the hell would I want to watch you play LoL when I could just play myself, I'm probably better than you anyway.""

Thanks for asking hypothetical skeptical internet person! There are a few reasons why tuning into my stream is always a good idea. First of all, Its super entertaining, I promise you that, you can expect myself and my gang of miscreants (The LoL Stars) to partake in all manner of shenanigans in our LoL games. Also, I'm gold 4 so that means theres a 90% chance I AM better than you. 

&gt;""Ok, I still still skeptical, what else you got for me""

I'll give you free stuff.

&gt;""Siiiiiick I love free stuff!""

Damn straight you do! Just watch me every week and your simple preseance will give you a chance to win free, thats right FREE, Riot Points!

He's currently at 225 followers. 

Check him out and follow if you'd like to be entered; last time we posted on here he gained a lot of followers so make sure you follow so hits 300 followers and does both giveaways!

If you'd like to help make the giveaway come faster then please upvote this post for visibility so others can see it and follow too.

**EDIT:** I may make another post later because this one was made so early. This giveaway is still at 10 PM EST though. 

**EDIT 2:** He decided that he's going to do both giveaways even if he doesn't hit 300 (he hit 250), because LeagueOfGiving isn't very popular when LCS is on so not as many people are in there. Thanks for the follows and keep it up, he'd still appreciate 300.

**EDIT 3:** IT'S HAPPENING NOW GET IN HERE LETS GOOOOOOOOOO

**EDIT 4:** Congrats to the two winners: Savior789 and sky_rnp3! Next giveaway is at 350 so if you missed this one then feel free to follow, he already got to 290 followers today."	t5_2uvf7	True

From my understanding, they do giveaways every 50 followers (I understand that because they did a giveaway at 1650 and said they will do a giveaway in about 30 followers[Meaning 1.7k followers]).



Edit: They will do a giveaway again at 1750.

Depending on how many people we can get on the stream at the time = the amount of lessons given.

Last week we hit 50 followers and 30+ Viewers and i gave out 4 lessons.

I can assure you everyone who i teach (yes even diamond players) will learn something valuable.

I'm Plat 2 at the moment myself (climbed from silver 4 in the past 2 months)after an extended break from the game.


So if you're interested in the lessons here's how to get a chance:

Follow this link - www.twitch.tv/rnglol

Hit favourite

Be around @ 23:00 CET

Type in the Keyword (that i will announce @ 23:00)

Don't be AFK when the raffle is done and provide me with your IGN (In game name)

Everyone is welcome, no matter what stage of the games learning curve you are at.


If you fail to win, don't be too sad as there will be more giveaways and for those interested in supporting my stream you can donate and i'll provide you with the equivalent value of time for the donation at your leasure.


Lessons themselves will be around 1 hour long for those winning the raffle and streamed unless you have a real problem with it. So people who don't win can still tune in to the lesson.


Cheers guys, and spread the word!"	t5_2uvf7	True

Hello Friends,

I am ThatsNotMyLane and I want you to come watch me play League of Legends.

&gt;""But TNML, why the hell would I want to watch you play LoL when I could just play myself, I'm probably better than you anyway.""

Thanks for asking hypothetical skeptical internet person! There are a few reasons why tuning into my stream is always a good idea. First of all, Its super entertaining, I promise you that, you can expect myself and my gang of miscreants (The LoL Stars) to partake in all manner of shenanigans in our LoL games. Also, I'm gold 5 so that means theres a 90% chance I AM better than you.

&gt;""Ok, I still still skeptical, what else you got for me""

I'll give you free stuff.

&gt;""Siiiiiick I love free stuff!""

Damn straight you do! Just watch me every week and your simple preseance will give you a chance to win free, thats right FREE, Riot Points!

1375278752.0	1jf5fz	[GIVEAWAY][EUW] Skin of your choice! (INFO INSIDE)	MavenLoL	3	2	0	"EDIT: STREAM IS NOW LIVE! http://www.twitch.tv/mavenlol

Hello and welcome to my first giveaway!

I am Maven and I am a new streamer. I have decided to give back to the people who take the time to watch me and reward a randomly chosen player with a skin of your choice! :)

Of course there are some rules with the giveaway, so we keep it fair for everyone.

**Rules**

1. You must follow my channel to be eligible for the giveaway

2. To follow me log in (or Create account) on Twitch TV and press the follow button on my stream: http://www.twitch.tv/mavenlol - This way you will recieve an e-mail whenever I'm streaming

3. There will be aditional information on how to actually win the skin on the stream (on the day of the stream - Don't worry, the stream will last the entire day)

4. The task to win a skin will be simple (for example, you will only need to type !skin in the chat of the stream)


**Time and date**
The giveaway event will take place on Friday, 2nd of August 2013, the WHOLE day! It's an all day stream.

I hope I will see you all there.
&gt; Note: The value of skin will decide on the amount of viewers (for example: 100 viewers for 520 RP skin and then 200 for 975 skin, etc. This is all changeable so don't worry.)

Cya on the stream ;)

1359626685.0	17mf6h	LoL Picture Website + Riot Point Contest	Ajesto	3	2	0	"I have created my website a long time ago, and it has recently started to pick up its pace. It was built for fun and to help people get rid of their boredom if they decided to take a break in between games.

Website is called: www.leaguememe.com

I know, it has the word meme in it (supposedly it was just for memes), but i decided later on it should also contain fan art, youtube videos, meme, hilarious pictures/convo, etc.

This website was intended to help summoners get rid of their boredom but it can also boost up your youtube account with subscribers and viewers. It can get your art around the community. Artist will get their own portfolio in the future and will be rewarded for original post with Riot points. 

I need your support to help and spread the news ONLY if you think this website is worth sharing. You can leave a nice feed back, criticism is welcome as well as this will allow me to improve my site for you guys.

There is also a lot of known bugs as my coder is in school and won't be able to fix it anytime soon.. but this will be done asap. I am not the richest kid around and I spend every spare change on this website..

Please contribute to my website as well by adding anything that is related to League of Legends it will keep my motivated to grow this website bigger.


The RP Contest:


Currently my fan page has 3,000 likes, every 200 like is a $10 RP card. After 1,000 likes I will be randomly selecting people that are registered on my website to win the RP cards, there will be 5 winners. I will be upgrading the prize in the future as my website slowly grows. (There is more detail on the page). 

1. Like my page www.facebook.com/leaguememes
2. Share / Like the Contest Photo
3. Register on my website and confirm your email http://www.leaguememe.com/page/login 


Some known issues people do not appreciate:

Watermark on art images ( will remove this ) 
Need to upgrade a credit button which will show my respect to all artist out there.

Again, I would love to receive some feedbacks, either you enjoy the website or some harsh criticism with respect. I spend a lot of time on this website and would like to know what you guys think.

Hello Friends,

I am ThatsNotMyLane and I want you to come watch me play League of Legends.

&gt;""But TNML, why the hell would I want to watch you play LoL when I could just play myself, I'm probably better than you anyway.""

Thanks for asking hypothetical skeptical internet person! There are a few reasons why tuning into my stream is always a good idea. First of all, Its super entertaining, I promise you that, you can expect myself and my gang of miscreants (The LoL Stars) to partake in all manner of shenanigans in our LoL games. Also, I'm gold 5 so that means theres a 90% chance I AM better than you.

&gt;""Ok, I still still skeptical, what else you got for me""

I'll give you free stuff.

&gt;""Siiiiiick I love free stuff!""

Damn straight you do! Just watch me every week and your simple preseance will give you a chance to win free, thats right FREE, Riot Points!

I just wanted to highlight that giving away w/ any random number generator is not always the best choice because:
1.) If you random based on the post #, than it's pretty much the same as you would just post it out (does not apply to ""post a random number"" method)
2.) everyone tries his luck, even if he has the skin in order to trade / sell it."	t5_2uvf7	True
