1360189393.0	180y2z	Instead of a traditional film or tv series, why not depict the Silmarillion as a 'historical' high budget documentary series?		200	29	59	Because there are a lot question marks regarding uncertain aspects of the tales maybe a documentary series (with scenes from the books played out by actors, CGI etc) would be the most appropriate means of presenting the stories. This would avoid the problems with depicting the narrative as a whole and would do justice to the scope of the story-lines by allowing them to be cleanly compartmentalized, yet also discussed in their broader contexts. Also it would allow input from Tolkien experts etc to weigh in, discuss (and maybe even depict) those uncertainties. This (if the documentary series encompassed all of Tolkien's works) could discuss such mysteries as the origin of Orcs, Tom Bombadil (spelling probably - sorry) and other questions left by JRR Tolkien. I think this would make more sense then an ambitious (and for casual audiences alienating) movie that attempts to knit together 20,000 odd years of fictional history into a traditional movie/t.v. plot.	t5_2r6jm	True

 "	SpaceCampDropOut	166	30	15	"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6mc3Fv7vDM
My mother and father were always meant to be together.  They sacrificed everything to be together.  My father was a lawyer from north India (Hindu country) my mother a nurse from south India (christian).  They fell in love quickly and ran away to America to be together since customs wouldn't allow them to marry in India. Their love was beyond deep.  They had 3 kids (1 being me) and they were inseparable.  One day, after my mom dropped me off at school and headed off to work, she was killed in a car accident right after.  It destroyed my father.  That was almost 20 years ago.  Since then, my father has refused to get remarried, she was the love of his life.  He mourns every day and I see it in his eyes and it kills me.  When I see this scene from Twin Towers, I reverse the role sand I see my father wandering the forest alone. It kills me, but reminds me that love exists.  I just wanted to share this scene and my father's story to show how much he loved and how much of an impact this scene has on others who have dealt or will deal with loss."	t5_2r6jm	True

- ""Tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the words, but evidently Merry was aroused.""

- ""'I hope not, indeed,' siad Butterbur. 'But spooks or no spooks, they won't get in The Pony so easy. Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs.'""

- ""At that moment, there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away. 'Hullo, Sam!' said Frodo. 'It's warm!' said Sam, 'Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through the long nights...""

- ""'I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his little room,' said Merry. 'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. I hope we get a chance of telling him about it!' There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast.""

- ""'If you want to know, I felt as if I hadn't got nothing on, and I didn't like it...' 'that's funny,' said Merry. 'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, only well, I don't think I'll say any more,' he ended lamely.""

- ""Aragorn and Legolas went now with Eomer in the van.""

- ""...here we find you feasting and idling - and smoking! Smoking! Where did you come by the weed, you villains?""

- ""[Pippin] was with Gandalf. The horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew in a deep breath. 'I did not know you rode bare-back, Gandalf,' he said."""	t5_2r6jm	True

Or the people who are confused by scenes like the White Council. They need to wait to see the next films before thinking it was a waste of time. It's very important to introduce Radagast and establish the Necromancer in this film, and to knock this film for doing so is ludicrous. I even saw someone complain about this film having ""multiple endings"", which is not something I understand at all.

I think it is bullshit. Pure bullshit. People on here might complain about the interpretation or the changes, and that I can at least understand, but the blind ""Should be one film, instant dislike"" people, that's pure insanity.

I loved the film. And not because I like LOTR or Peter Jackson or Sherlock, because it is a great film. It made me laugh a ton, the action scenes were great (even the ridiculous ones I actually enjoyed instead of crying like during a Pirates film.), and I loved the development of Bilbo. Bilbo himself was a joy to watch the entire time."	t5_2r6jm	True

1363410709.0	1ae9s0	A brief response to the thread about Christopher Tolkien's opinion of Peter Jackson's films.	flagamuffin	148	30	116	"[The comment I was replying specifically to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/19v3ac/could_pj_have_done_anything_with_the_movies_that/c8rlv2g) My comment can be taken as a response to the entire school of thought, however. What follows is a brief defense of Peter Jackson's handling of the movies. I realize that this is an unpopular opinion in this sub, which is understandable, but hear me out if you will.

____

I think yours is the most commonly heard criticism of the movies (on this subreddit, and in general). It encapsulates the general feeling of the die-hard fan. However, this is where I always lose these complaints:

&gt;and hate any and every stupid, needless change from the books.

I don't think that the trilogy, as it exists, makes a particularly watchable set of movies. Not when rendered with utter faith. I think Jackson, being an expert filmmaker, agreed with that assessment and included elements that aren't true to the books for that reason. Nothing ""needless,"" no Hollywood ego. I really don't think that entered into it; Peter and a few of the others (note esp. Christopher Lee and a few of the producers/script adapters) care too much for that to be the case. I wish more people understood this. It's not ""understandable hate,"" it's silly simple-mindedness.

Examples I think include Gimli's character -- large portions of The Two Towers have to be held together with merely the strength of Orlando, Viggo, and John's acting, and some sort of relief in the form of witty lines is necessary -- Faramir, some of the more over-the-top action sequences from Legolas, etc. There are a few places that just miss the mark, like you said (Denethor was my prime focus of discontent with Return of the King), but they are few, far between, and almost 100 percent due to a lack of time, I think. The bottom line, to me, is that the books as they are just aren't movies non-megafans people would watch. Without Faramir's extra interference to create a minor plot conflict, Frodo's journey from the Emyn Muil to Cirith Ungol seems interminable to the average watcher, but you can't skip it without changing the pace and order of events elsewhere. It has the additional effect of spelling out the difference between Faramir and Boromir to the non-megafan, and emphasizing the effects of the ring as foreshadowing for the climactic scene within Orodruin. These things can be foreshadowed in a dozen little ways in a novel set as long as Lord of the Rings, but it's much more difficult in film.

My last point is that, pure and simple, the Jackson films hugely expanded the Lord of the Rings fandom, which can only be a good thing. For every ten who see the movies and think of Eragon, one or two may pick up Unfinished Tales. And that's utterly worth it. I dislike Christopher Tolkien immensely for failing to understand this.

Just felt like airing my thoughts. (EDIT: and by now I've probably written 5000 words in this thread. I'm endlessly glad we're all so passionate about Lord of the Rings.)

EDIT2: Thanks everyone who bothered to specifically underscore their positions with long arguments. I appreciated it. A little disappointed by the downvotes of reasonable and polite discussion (on both sides), but the excellent comments make up for it. I definitely understand the point-of-view of those of you who dislike the films heavily more clearly now. "	t5_2r6jm	True

1355157639.0	14lz5p	What would Sauron have done with Smaug and Durin's Bane?	nilhaus	97	12	59	"Imagining that somehow the events of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit played out mostly the same, but assuming that Smaug and Durin's Bane escaped rather than be destroyed, what would have happened?

First off, was Sauron even aware of them?

Sauron must have been aware of Smaug for hundreds of years, but it seems never contacted him or attempted to influence him in any way that is clear. Men, dwarves, elves, and orcs were all well aware of Smaug's existence and exact location. Durin's Bane seems to be a similar story. Sauron even purposely sent orcs to inhabit the area Moria, and surely tales of the Balrog there must have reached his ears. So it seems that Sauron was aware of both entities for a long time but did nothing. Best case scenario seems to be that Sauron knew of them, but was satisfied with their position and what they were doing. I simply don't think that to be the case. Such powerful creatures shouldn't be used defensively or lazily. 

Could Sauron have controlled Smaug or Durin's Bane?

Sauron was certainly powerful as a lord and as a Maiar and influential among all races given his long record of deception and trickery. While Sauron may not have been able to bend these powerful creature to his will absolutely, he surely could have influenced them well enough to put them to good use.  

A Balrog, while not as mighty or cunning as Sauron, was of an equal order to him and would have likely been able to resist his whip without the ring. Balrog's seem to have little personality or desire outside being directed to war and destruction, so to what end would it resist his orders? The Balrog obviously has a desire to survive and live, as is evidence by it's hiding in Moria; yet, it makes no move to set itself up as a king among orcs or strike out beyond the gates. Compare to the Nazgul who conquered and ruled when not under the direct control of Sauron. However, when Gandalf is in his presence it relishes in the opportunity to kill him, even at the very real risk of dying himself. Durin's Bane seems ripe for directing in battle if pushed by a more powerful creature like Sauron. I'd say yes, Sauron could have controlled the Balrog in that it would willingly participate in the destruction of elves, Maiar, and men; as it had ages ago. 

What of Smaug?

Dragons are notoriously independent creatures. Even the mighty Melkor, creator of the dragons could not control them absolutely. Glaurung issued forth from Angband before Melkor had wished to reveal him to the world. Could Sauron, servant of Melkor and of a lesser order do any better? I don't see anything that would direct me towards yes. However, Sauron is cunning and would likely know this, and also know how to influence Smaug to his own wishes. Smaug would be easily provoked into revenge and by greed. Sauron could offer any number of cities for plundering and at the most extreme even one of the lesser rings of power. We know he had many of them in his possession, somewhere around twelve if I remember correctly. Again, the answer seems to be yes. Sauron could bend Smaug to his will in one way or another, though not as absolutely or willingly as the Balrog. 

How are these two creatures best used?

It is hard to place any absolute strength on creatures in Tolkien's writings, but this isn't really a problem. Both creatures in question are beyond the power of most almost any man, elf, or dwarf, barring special circumstances. 

A flying, fire-breathing dragon like Smaug could cause great devastation. Burning forests, striking from the sky, immune to arrows (mostly...) and likely able to dispatch eagles without much trouble. What better use than the destruction of Lothlorien? We know it was under a attack during the final battle, and the presence of Smaug could have tipped the balance in Sauron's favor. Smaug ~~was already in the area anyway and~~ clearly liked burning down trees as evidence by the desolation of Smaug. Galadriel or Celeborn may have been able to drive him off or even kill Smaug, but the destruction he would have brought could destroy their city and force them to flee. Just as good. 

What of Durin's Bane? Well, the Balrog would likely relish the chance to try to kill Gandalf a second time, so let him have it. Instead of the Witch King being the first creature to enter the gates of Minas Tirith, imagine the Balrog striding (not flying) through to duel with Gandalf. Given their relative parity he may succeed this time, and at a minimum he is keeping Gandalf from rallying troops and saving the city. Again, just as good. The Balrog might have followed them there anyway, not requiring much direction.

I feel like I should have a conclusion, but I don't. I guess it was just a bit of a thought experiment, and it seems that Sauron could have still won the war without the Ring with just one of these beasts at his disposal. Even if he only had one or the other I don't see his plan or my speculated use changing much. Smaug might have been compelled to attack Minas Tirith should it be given to him as a treasure; though, I imagine Sauron would have preferred to set up one of his Nazgul as king there.

Recently Fran, Phil and I did just this when we watched for the first time an early cut of the first movie - and a large chunk of the second. We were really pleased with the way the story was coming together, in particular, the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life.  All of which gave rise to a simple question: do we take this chance to tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers, and as fans, was an unreserved ‘yes.'  
 
We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the Wizard Gandalf, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance.  The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth.
 
So, without further ado and on behalf of New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Wingnut Films, and the entire cast and crew of “The Hobbit” films, I’d like to announce that two films will become three.  
 
It has been an unexpected journey indeed, and in the words of Professor Tolkien himself, ""a tale that grew in the telling.""
 
Cheers,

Personally, I'm inclined to think yes, though my reasons for imagining so are mostly limited to a probable desire to keep one's romantic or sexual experiences fresh through experimentation. Another alternative is that over such a long life, the significance of and therefore interest in sex fades.

But men, particularly early on, regarded them with suspicion, and Hobbits seem to have no knowledge of them. 

It's been a while since I read through the Silmarillion. Does anyone actually worship the gods or Illuvatar, or are they just an accepted part of existence in Arda?

1356254277.0	15bkms	Let's talk about Gollum, guys. (Some discussion prompts)	Bendubendubendu	80	6	37	"I've been seeing a lot of posts about ""Who are the Blue Wizards"" and other basic factual questions regarding the texts. So why don't we just have a discussion about some hopefully deeper and more thematic things in the works? And what better place to start a discussion than from my favorite character and (in my estimation) the most significant thing Tolkien ever wrote: Gollum!

So, Gollum is a complicated character, especially for Tolkien fans. He is the pop culture face of the entire franchise in a lot of ways. That might make him a little bit frustrating to a lot of fans--making Gollum sort of the emblem of ignorant fans (I saw The Hobbit with someone who had no knowledge of Tolkien except for knowing that Gollum was a thing). However, I think a lot of fans can agree that when it comes to the actual canonical text of the Rings saga, Gollum is far and away the most deep and complex character we get. Not just because of his motivations and personality in the book but because of the implications in regards to Tolkien's otherwise strictly ordered sense of morality. What follows is a set of discussion questions I would really like to see Tolkien fans discuss, and which I have some opinions on myself:

First of all, was Smeagol actually a hugely successful Ringbearer? At least as far as the ""Good"" side of things was concerned? In Rings, of course, the Hobbits seem to be extremely good at resisting the temptation of the power of the ring. Of course, Smeagol was something like a hobbit, and was also the primary Ringbearer outside of Sauron. This question gets into some of my later questions, but surely Gollum had the least potential for evil within him of all the Ringbearers? Of the hobbits we see that Frodo eventually imagines himself the ruler of the world and that Sam sees himself as a mighty warrior, but Gollum had the ring for centuries and his greatest ambition seemed to be to merely possess the ring and sustain himself. He did horrible things to obtain and attempt to take back the ring, but what of Gollum's POTENTIAL for evil actions?

Secondly, in my mind, Gollum represents the exact middle of Tolkien's metric of good and evil. Gollum is capable of evil actions in service to his obsession/addiction, but throughout the text it is suggested that Gollum is interested in redemption. It just so happens that his redemption (or chance at redemption) is facilitated by a supportive peer: Frodo (and hampered by a disapproving peer: Sam). Of course, Gollum and Frodo ultimately fail in their struggle with their addiction (keep Tolkien off the AA reading list, please) but why? In my estimation of things: Frodo is in the heart of evil at that point the book, and Gollum has only had one individual care for him in centuries. Gollum was so reviled for his personal weakness and his addiction that his entire identity became it. He was named Gollum not really by himself or by the power of the ring but by his community who hated him. Might there be an interpretation in Tolkien that evil is not really absolute? That support from those who understand you and believe you can do better can make you better? Could this have been true for Sauron? Or Melkor/Morgoth?

Lastly, I'll just point out that Gollum is genuinely my favorite character. From the time I was in middle school and first read Lord of the Rings he resonated with me most. There's a reason he's the most popular character in the series, and I believe it is because of his complexity. My last question is, is there anyone who is actually disappointed with the portrayal of Gollum by Serkis in the films? In my estimation, there is too much of a divide between a clearly ""evil"" side (Gollum) and a clearly ""good"" side (Smeagol) which I feel like was never intended. As a matter of fact, given my history with the actual books, it has always been the only thing I really took offense to in the films. In my mind, Gollum in the books was always Gollum, he never had multiple personalities, and the goodness of his original self shining through was merely his own self-realization shining through regarding his own addiction. However, the movie portrays it in such a way that it makes it look the ring turns you into some sort of schizophrenic. Am I remembering things wrong or is that not at all supported by the text?"	t5_2r6jm	True

The part of the passage I'm referring to takes place during the Meeting of the White Council when they talk about Dol Guldur. The part of the passage is:

""Gandalf did not laugh again; and he did not answer, but looking keenly at Saruman he drew his pipe and sent out a great ring of smoke with many smaller rings that followed it. Then he put up his hand, as if to grasp them, and they vanished.""

After this section it is stated that Gandalf doesn't yet know of Saruman's betrayal, but the smoke rings to me seem to have meant to resemble the One Ring and the other rings of power. What are your thoughts of the significants of the smoke rings? My assumption is he was hinting at Saruman telling him that is he tried to retrieve the rings he would fail doing so."	t5_2r6jm	True
1370145500.0	1fi3g8	Why didn't Glorfindel join the Fellowship?	Whampa	83	15	63	"As many of you know, after sacrificing himself in the defense of Tour and Idril during the battle of Eagle's Cleft, Glorfindel was reincarnated and sent back to Middle-earth to aid in the struggle against Sauron.  The two most likely dates Tolkien gave for this reappearance were with the Istari, in 1000 TA, or around SA 1600, just before the war against Sauron.  But both of these possibilities seem somewhat incongruent.  Glorfindel was one of the most powerful Elves in Middle-earth at the time: his assistance would have been irreplaceable; but for some reason he stayed in Rivendell. 

 If Glorfindel had come across with the five wizards, would he not be a companion of Gandalf who would want to help destroy the Ring?  After all, his very purpose in being carnate was to fight Sauron.  Perhaps he should even be on the White Council.  

If he had crossed over in 1600 SA he must have fought in the Last Alliance.  If this was the case, then joining the Fellowship would have been the perfect way to finish what he started, so to speak.  After all, getting 'that close' would make the task of destroying the Ring that much more paramount.    
    
I am aware that this subject was the target of some of Tolkiens very last writings, and by the time he decided Glorfindel was a single character it was too late to change LOTR, but I'm wondering if there are any legendariumly accurate explanations."	t5_2r6jm	True

1328451112.0	pbts8	Gandalf and his role. Thought it be fun to get a discussion going.		72	8	45	"Maybe it's just me but I've noticed some discussions going on about Gandalf and his role in the books. So I though it'd be fun to put it into one post where we can chat about it. 

So in the spirit of starting the discussion: 

The Unfinished Tales tells us that Gandalf was sent to Middle-Earth, along with four other wizards collectively named Istari, as: “messengers sent to contest the power of Sauron” but that they were ""forbidden to match his power, or to seek to dominate Elves or men by force or fear.” (The Unfinished Tales 506) 

Gandalf shows this behavior several times during the course of the books. He never displays his power unless there is great need for it, take the Balrog fight, his rescue of Faramir or confrontation with the Witch-King for example. 

Then there is also the subject of his role as a messenger. Tolkien mentions in his letters that: “His [Gandalf’s] function as a ‘wizard’ is an angelos or messenger from the Valar or Rulers.” (Letters 237) Note Tolkien's use of the word ""angelos"", a greek work meaning messenger. More specifically though heavenly messenger, an angel.
However Tom Shippey points out that Gandalf certainly didn't appear as the iconographic kind of angel. He was too short tempered, capable of human emotions such as fear, anxiety, doubt and hunger. That to provide Gandalf with anything other than a human form and emotions “would instantly diminish the stature of their characters, devalue their decisions and their courage.” (The Road to Middle-Earth 171) That is to say Tolkien deliberately made him relatable.

Shippey’s point is interesting because if Tolkien had made Gandalf and the Istari glorious compared to the Valar, the second in the divine hierarchy, then he and the Istari would be more inclined to command rather than deliver a message. The iconographic image of an angel represents authority rather than harmony; that humans follow the edict of God because they are told to do so, or driven by divine inspiration, as opposed to a spark of courage or imagination driven by human inspiration, separate from the divine.   

So with all this in mind what is your take on Gandalf? Do you agree with me or not, and if so why? Also consider how different Gandalf is in Peter Jackson's trilogy as opposed to the books.

I'm looking forward to your thoughts!

1369272959.0	1evjfa	Lore Contest II: The Lord of the Rings	ebneter	72	9	18	"First prize: A boxed set of the original Ballantine paperback edition of *The Lord of the Rings* with the Barbara Remington covers. In decent but not collectible condition.

Second prize: A set of the original Ballantine paperback edition of *The Lord of the Rings* with the Barbara Remington covers. In decent but not collectible condition, no box.

Rules: Send me (/u/ebneter) a PM with your answers, *do not post them here!* The winner is whoever answers all the questions most correctly according to my judgement. There is a tie-breaker question. In the event of a tie on the tie-breaker question, I'll ask another tie-breaker question. Time: 24 hours from when the post goes up. *You may use any resources you have available, including the Internet and books.*

1. Tolkien once commented that all the lore mentioned in *The Lord of the Rings* pre-existed in his mythology, except for one thing. What was that? He later came up with a story to go with that item as well. What was the story?

2. Gandalf recites a rhyme to himself while riding Shadowfax to Gondor, which ends, ""Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree."" Identify the seven stars, the seven stones, and the white tree. What was the history of the white tree?

3. What is the earliest mention of the herb *athelas* in *The Lord of the Rings*? Discuss the significance of its appearance at this point in the story.

4. Who are the dead in the Dead Marshes? What occurred there?

5. What are all of Gandalf's names in Middle-earth? What name was he known by in Valinor? What Vala did he serve there?

Tie-breaker: Sam recites his poem about a troll when the hobbits and Strider encounter the stone trolls from Bilbo's adventure. Like several other poems associated with *The Lord of the Rings*, the poem was written by Tolkien and published long before the novel. What was the name of the original version and where did it appear? To what tune was it meant to be sung?

Scoring will be like the previous contest, so have at it.

EDIT @3:00PM PDT: Only four entries so far? Wow. I thought this one was pretty easy, except for the tie-breaker.

EDIT @5:15PM PDT: Still only five entries. I am going to extend this 24 hours and cross-post to /r/lotr.

EDIT: Time's up! I will grade and post the winners tomorrow.

And we have a winner! Two winners, actually, of course, since there are two prizes. First place goes to /u/Cheimon, and second goes to /u/ladyofgaladhris. There was a tie for third between /u/uncornrage and /u/lomethoron.

Some interesting things: Only a couple of people got (1) correct; the answer is the cats of Queen Beruthiel. Tolkien later came up with a story linking her to one of the Kings of Gondor, but at the time he wrote the book, he had no idea who she was. The tie-breaker was pretty hard; most people who answered it forgot that *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* was published *after* *The Lord of the Rings*. Only one person got this right: The poem, originally titled ""Pēro and Pōdex"" and then ""The Root of the Boot,"" was first published in the extremely rare pamphlet called *Songs for the Philologists*, edited by Tolkien's friend and collaborator E.V. Gordon. Question (2) was mostly answered correctly, although the common answer that the seven stars are the Valacirca is actually not supported by Tolkien anywhere that I am aware of, despite it seeming incredibly obvious. (If someone can find a reference for Tolkien stating the connection, I would be grateful.) I gave full credit for both the Valacirca or the alternative, that the seven stars were on the flags of the ships carrying the palantiri.

I thought that these questions were much easier than the first contest, but that apparently was not the case! If you participated and want to see your score, PM me and I'll send it to you."	t5_2r6jm	True

In the event of a tie on the tie-breaker question, I'll ask another tie-breaker question. Time: 24 hours from when the post goes up.

1. In *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Bilbo writes and recites a poem about Eärendil. Aragorn tells him that if he ""had the cheek to make verses about Eärendil in the house of Elrond, it was [Bilbo's] affair."" What did Aragorn mean by that?

2. Aragorn insisted that Bilbo include a reference to a green stone. Why? What stone was it?

3. Who were Eärendil's parents? What was their fate?

4. How is Eärendil connected to Frodo?

Tie-breaker: Tolkien's Eärendil had an inspiration outside of Tolkien's *legendarium*. What was it?

What struck me last night was how Isildur becomes even more of a tragic figure after reading this book.

In the film he's portrayed as a weak man.

In Unfinished Tales, his journey after claiming the ring shows a man who realized his mistake and gets caught trying to fix it.

While there are different accounts of Gollum, he could be seen as even more sympathetic (and strong). Some versions indicate he purposely mislead Sauron while being tortured about the location of the Hobbits.

Her ears get blocked while flying, and she was having trouble hearing, so she goes to turn on the subtitles ... and all that is available is Hebrew. A little odd, but my wife speaks Hebrew, so it was good enough for going on with.

They get to the sequence with the goblins, and at one point the subtitles have to express the fact that the Dwarves are all yelling. There are generally two ways to go about this: either say something like &lt;*screaming*&gt; or get onomatopoeic with is and do something like &lt;*AAAAHHHH!*&gt;. The subtitles chose the latter.

Second place, and (by their choice) the collection of essays, *The Silmarillion: Thirty Years Later*, goes to /u/picobit, who was the only other entrant to get the tie-breaker correct. And who has the good taste to live in a country whose queen is a Tolkien fan (and a fine illustrator).

Third place, and the book-club edition *Silmarillion*, went to /u/whampa.

DoorGuote	48	2	30	"It seems to me, in a world that, as far as fantasy goes, seems relatively grounded in realism, curses and prophecies are regarded very highly by those in Middle-Earth. They seem to come true or bear heavy weights on decisions, as well. A few I am thinking of include:

* The Witch King of Angmar's prophecy that no man shall kill him.^1,2

* The dream of Faramir, prophesying the Halfling, Imladris, and the Ring.^3

* The curse on the forsaken men of Dunharrow by Isildur at the Stone of Erech, fating them to remain undead until their oath is fulfilled.^4

What power exists for mortals (and immortal Elves, for that matter) to put events into motion by mere words? Does the Stone of Erech have a magical power, with which things like curses can be placed by the rightful user?

1369718489.0	1f6mck	Lore Contest II: Answers	ebneter	58	8	13	"Several people have requested the answers to the questions, so with no further ado...

&gt; 1. Tolkien once commented that all the lore mentioned in *The Lord of the Rings* pre-existed in his mythology, except for one thing. What was that? He later came up with a story to go with that item as well. What was the story?

Tolkien wrote, in a letter to Lord Halsbury, ""I do not think that anything is reffered to in *The L. of the R.* which does not actually exist in Legends written before it was begun, or at least belonging to an earlier period — except on the 'cats of Queen Berúthiel.'"" (*Letters*, p. 228) In *Unfinished Tales*, however, we find, in a note to the essay ""The Istari"", that Berúthiel was later explained to be the wife of Tarannon, twelfth king of Gondor, who lived in Osgiliath and hated ""the sounds and the smells of the sea... She had nine black cats and one white, her slaves, with whom she conversed, or read their memories, setting them to discover all the dark secrets of Gondor..."" (*Unfinished Tales*, pp. 401-402). Tolkien also gave a similar story in an interview in 1966, as cited in Hammond and Scull's *The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion* (p.284).

&gt; 2. Gandalf recites a rhyme to himself while riding Shadowfax to Gondor, which ends, ""Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree."" Identify the seven stars, the seven stones, and the white tree. What was the history of the white tree?

The seven stones, of course, are the *palantíri*, but the seven stars are surprisingly more difficult to explain. Tolkien's explanation, at least in the Index of the Second Edition, is that the seven stars ""originally represented the single stars on the banners of each of seven ships (of 9) that bore a *palantír*."" Tolkien himself seems to have missed the obvious connection to the Valacirca, the Sickle of the Valar, placed in the northern sky as a warning to Melkor before the awakening of the Elves.  (I gave credit for both answers; although the second isn't supported by the text, Tolkien's actual explanation has a rather strained quality to it.)

The White Tree, of course, was the tree grown from the fruit of Nimloth taken by Isildur from the King's Court in Númenor, and planted in Minas Ithil. Nimloth was a seedling of Celeborn, a seedling of Galathilion, the White Tree of the Eldar, made by Yavanna as a model of Telperion (or maybe a seedling of Telperion — both tales are extant). Nimloth was given to Elros by the Eldar of Tol Eressëa, and eventually burned on an altar by Sauron during the reign of A-Pharazôn. The original White Tree of Gondor was destroyed when Sauron captured Minas Ithil in the Second Age, but Isildur took a seedling from this tree and planted it in the Citadel of Minas Anor (later, of course, Minas Tirith) after the overthrow of Sauron. That tree died during the Great Plague in TA 1636, but another seedling was planted to replace it; *that* tree died in 2852 and was left standing as the Withered Tree as no replacement was found until Aragorn came along and found a sapling in TA 3019

&gt; 3. What is the earliest mention of the herb *athelas* in *The Lord of the Rings*? Discuss the significance of its appearance at this point in the story.

*Athelas* is first mentioned in the chapter ""Flight to the Ford,"" the last chapter of Book One of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, when Aragorn finds some withered leaves of the plant to try to heal Frodo's morgul-knife wound. It foreshadows the later appearance in *The Return of the King*, when Aragorn uses it to heal Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, and his identity as the King is revealed — ""'The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.'"" It is the second hint (after Bilbo's poem in Gandalf's letter) — although one will not know this on first reading — that Strider is much more than he seems.

&gt; 4. Who are the dead in the Dead Marshes? What occurred there?

The dead are the Men and Elves killed in the Battle of Dagorlad, along with many Wainriders who were driven into the Dead Marshes in the Battle of the Camp in the Third Age. The area was originally not marshy; the marshes overwhelmed the battlefield and the burial grounds during the early part of the Third Age.

&gt; 5. What are all of Gandalf's names in Middle-earth? What name was he known by in Valinor? What Vala did he serve there?

""*Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves; Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgottenm in South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.*"" He is called various other things, some less than polite, but those are his names. *Olórin*, of course, was his name in Valinor. There he was associated with Lórien/Irmo and Manwë, and learned mercy and pity from Nienna. As is usual with Tolkien, however, the details of his associations in Valinor differ in different texts.

&gt; Tie-breaker: Sam recites his poem about a troll when the hobbits and Strider encounter the stone trolls from Bilbo's adventure. Like several other poems associated with *The Lord of the Rings*, the poem was written by Tolkien and published long before the novel. What was the name of the original version and where did it appear? To what tune was it meant to be sung?

The poem, originally titled ""Pēro and Pōdex"" and then ""The Root of the Boot,"" was first published in the extremely rare booklet called *Songs for the Philologists*, edited by Tolkien's friend and collaborator E.V. Gordon and printed at Oxford. (It is believed that only 14 copies survive.) It was meant to be sung to the tune of the traditional song ""The Fox Went Out,"" and there is a recording of Tolkien singing it available. It was reprinted in *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* after its appearance in *The Lord of the Rings.* The main changes between the original version and the later version involve removing references to Christian beliefs like the fate of the soul and changing ""churchyard"" to ""graveyard."" The original version was reprinted in *The Annotated Hobbit* and a slightly different version in *The Return of the Shadow.*

As for me I proposed to my girlfriend of 3 years in a forest overlooking a natural whirlpool and reciting a passage from 'The Silmarillion'.

'He forgot then utterly all his folk and all the purposes of his mind, and following the birds under the shadows of the trees he passed deep into Nan Elmoth and was lost. But he came at last upon a glade under the stars, and there Melian stood; and out of the darkness he beheld her with hands outstretched, and the light of Aman was in her face.
No word she spoke but being filled with love Elwe came to her and took her hand; and straightaway a spell was laid on him, so that they stood thus, hand in hand, while long years were measured by the wheeling stars above them; and the trees of Nan Elmoth grew tall and dark ere they spoke any word to one another.'

She looked surprised, but when I said ""Frodo wont get very far without Sam"", she knew it was happening and the tears commenced for the both of us. Additionally her engagement ring is a legitimate replica of Galadriels Ring of Power. 

TL;DR I proposed with a Ring of Power reciting the Silmarillion in a forest.

Since I first read LOTR many years ago, my mental picture of Orcs has been heavily influenced by modern conceptions of what an Orc looks like. I always pictured them as vaguely humanoid but porcine creatures, very bestial, with fangs and so on.

I've noticed that Tolkein doesn't much describe Orcs in the LOTR though. And what descriptions he does offer certainly don't match the image above. He describes them as 'squint-eyed', 'bow-legged', and 'dark-skinned', but these are all descriptors that could even describe certain humans. 

And I'm sure he alludes to the fact that Orcs and Humans sometimes interbreed... the 'squint-eyed Southerner' in Bree is described as being human, but having some Orcish ancestry.

I guess what I'm asking is whether Tolkein really intended his Orcs to be as bestial as they've come to be portrayed in later years. Is there any chance he intended them to be something akin to a very violent/backward/dirty species of human?

My knowledge of Tolkiens greatly surpasses her's.  So I tried to explain what I thought Frodo was all about.

I like to use a drug addiction like Heroin as a metaphor for Frodo and the ring.  Frodo has to destroy this thing that has a great hold on him.  Every step he takes it gets worse.  It may kill him if he does not take it.  But taking it will certainly lead to death.  

I told her about how at the Council of Elrond, the most unlikely creature offered to take the ring to Mordor.  Obviously this guy was something special.  

I then told her about how Tolkien grew up in Rural England.  When the industrial revolution destroyed everything green that he loved it disgusted him.  Then he was trust into the first world war as an infinity man against the war machine that was Germany.  The first would war basically destroyed a generation of the UK.  Tolkien was a small guy who had no business being where he was and frankly didnt want to be there anyway.  But he knows that he has a job to do and he hates it.  Just like Frodo and the ring.

So I told her all of that and she still is confused by Frodo.  Well, am I full of shit?

A fellow Tolkien aficionado and I got to talking, and I want to open up a discussion here considering the idea that Olorin (Gandalf) was ""destined"" to become the Ainu in control of the realm of fire in Ea. A while back I heard a podcast by The Tolkien Professor, who made an interesting point that there are Ainu casted for the realms of earth, water, and air. However, a fire spirit is never specified (Professor Olsen stipulates that it could have been the unfulfilled job opening for Melkor). 

This leads to our discussion- Gandalf is associated with fire in the Hobbit and LOTR- fireworks, Narya (fire ring), Secret Fire (hope in hearts?), and the flame of Anor (no idea). To quote Unfinished Tales, ""he was the Enemy of Sauron, opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles"".

1375035182.0	1j85cz	Tolkien's lesser known books: Sir Orfeo	el_micha	51	9	22	"Dear fellow Tolkien-fans!

The top posts in this subreddit all concern Tolkien's more popular works: The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and Quenta Silmarillion. While most of you are aware that there is more to read about Tolkien's Universe than these three, I am not sure how many of you know what other books Tolkien wrote, which are *not* set in Middle-Earth. 

Recently, The Fall of Arthur was published, which got some attention here. Now and then in comments and posts, people mention The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún, or Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, or older texts about Tom Bombadil. But the talk about these (and similar) books is surprisingly sparse. Since this is /r/tolkienfans and not ""just"" /r/lotr, I hope and think we have the potential to not exclusively deal with Tolkien's most popular literature, but also discuss some of his lesser known works. This is not meant as a critique, but as a suggestion.

I will start by introducing **Sir Orfeo**, and hope to inspire some of you to present your favourite JRRT-treasures. 

*Sir Orfeo* is Professor Tolkien's translation of a short Middle English [narrative poem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Orfeo) from an anonymous author who lived around the early 14th century. As is typical for Tolkien, he tried to stay as close to the original verse form as possible. The result is a very smooth and easily readable pair-rhyme poem. 

The story is about Sir Orfeo, an English king, and his beautiful queen Lady Heurodis, who is being kidnapped by a Fairy King. Orfeo, a terrific harper, sets out to find his lost queen and win her back with his lovely music.    
Sounds familiar? Well, Orfeo's name in the original ancient greek version is Orpheus, and Heurodis is of course Eurydice. Somehow, this tale from [Ovid's Metamorphoses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus#Death_of_Eurydice) has found it's way to medieval England, where it was written down and at last made available for all of us to read by Professor Tolkien. 

*Sir Orfeo* is not only very beautiful to read and interesting because of it's age and long tradition, but also a must-read for every serious Tolkien-fan, because it had a literary influence on one book you have all read: The Hobbit.    
When the Dwarves and Bilbo travel through Mirkwood, there is a chapter that [remotely rings](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/tolkien_studies/summary/v007/7.honegger.html) of a passage in *Sir Orfeo*: 

*There often by him would he see,*    
*when noon was hot on leaf and tree,*    
*the king of Faërie with his rout*    
*came hunting in the woods about*    
*with blowing far and crying dim,*    
*and barking hounds that were with him;*    
*yet never a beast they took nor slew,*    
*and where they went he never knew.*     
*At other times he would descry*     
*a mighty host, it seemed, go by,*     
*ten hundred knights all fair arrayed*     
*with many a banner proud displayed...*    

While the chapter *Flies and Spiders* in the Hobbit is not quite so explicit about the Fairy King, it is generally agreed that the Wood Elves' apperance and character are influenced by this passage (see above link). 

For comparison, here is the corresponding original Middle-English text:

*He might se him bisides,*    
*Oft in hot undertides,*    
*The king o fairy with his rout*    
*Com to hunt him al about*    
*With dim cri and bloweing,*    
*And houndes also with him berking;*    
*Ac no best thai no nome,*    
*No never he nist whider they bicome*    
*And other while he might him se*    
*As a gret ost bi him te,*    
*Wele atourned, ten hundred knightes,*    
*Ich y-armed to his rightes,*    
*Of cuntenaunce stout and fers,*    
*With mani desplaid baners...*    

Isn't this amazing? How well Tolkien preserved the tone, rhythm, verses, even the vocabulary is astoundingly similar! And once you have read the translation, the original is not even too hard to understand. 

So, [here is a link to Tolkien's Sir Orfeo](http://allpoetry.com/poem/8499981-Sir_Orfeo-by-J_R_R_Tolkien), and here a [link to the original poem](http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/orfeo.htm).

1375166439.0	1jc1ct	Lore Contest III: Unanswerable Questions	ebneter	42	3	17	"Yes, it's that time again: A new lore contest.

Prizes: (1) A first edition, first printing of *The Silmarillion* UK edition, published by George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1977, complete with dust jacket and fold-out map. (2) A BCA edition of *The Silmarillion*, unknown date, with dust jacket. Maps are included but the map in the back is not the nice fold-out variety. (3) *The Silmarillion: Thirty Years On*, ed. Allan Turner — a collection of essays on *The Silmarillion*.

I will award the prizes as follows: First place chooses, second place chooses from the remaining two, and third place gets the final book.

And now, I suppose you wonder: *Unanswerable* questions? Yes, these questions *do not* have canonical answers (well, one does, but no one likes it). So how should you answer them? I am looking for discussion of the possibilities and what JRRT himself had to say on the subject; that is, hie thee to thy copies of *Letters*, *HoMe*, and so on, for this is a challenging contest. And because of that I am running it for a week: It will end Monday, August 5th, at 2200 (8:00 PM) PDT, or 0300 GMT. The usual applies: Send me your missives by personal message, and I will grade them (which may take longer than usual). Yes, it's all a bit arbitrary. But, my prizes, my rules. ;-)

The Questions:

1. Who is Tom Bombadil?
2. Where did Orcs come from?
3. Was Galadriel still under exile during the Third Age?
4. Why didn't the Eagles just fly the Fellowship to Mordor?

Tie-breaker: Which of these has a canonical answer, and what is it?

Have fun, and yes, I'm serious. :-)

IMPORTANT EDIT:

I should probably have stated what is considered 'canon' for these purposes: Any writing about Middle-earth *published during J.R.R. Tolkien's lifetime*. That is:  *The Hobbit*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil*, and *The Road Goes Ever On*. In other words, *The Silmarillion* is *not* canonical, as we don't know that JRRT would have approved every jot and tittle. Material from JRRT's *Letters*, if stated definitively enough, may also be considered canonical, especially if strongly supported by other canonical material. (For example, in one letter, JRRT describes Sauron's physical form; that would be considered canonical.) If you've already submitted your answers, feel free to modify accordingly.

EDIT: ***Time's up!*** Thanks to everyone who is participating. I have *19* entrants, so it will be a few days before I can announce a winner — I've read all the entries through at least once but now must go back and grade them to choose a winner and runners up. I will post the winners and the answers in new posts."	t5_2r6jm	True

Baldor, the second King of Rohan, vowed that he would walk the Paths of the Dead under the Haunted Mountain near Dunharrow. In the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn and his posse find a skeleton in mail that appears to have been trying to claw his way -into- a room, even to the point where he wore his fingers away and clawed at the door with his wearing finger bones. No one knows why he was drawn madly to the door and didn't flee back the way he came.

How flippin' cool is that scene? It gives me chills just to think about it. I don't even know for sure if the skeleton is the remains of Baldor or what.

Anyway- my question is this: is there any discussion of that door in the appendices or supporting writings of Tolkien? After Isildur's oath was fulfilled, that path should have been safer to walk.

1365623970.0	1c32bz	The One Rings falls under the Doom of The Valar (Theory)	kamehamehigh	51	14	38	"The Elves of Eregion made the rings of power and worked under Celebrimbor who formed the Gwaith-i-Mírdain (lit, ""People of the Jewel Smiths""). He was also the son of Curufin, the fifth son of Feanor: the most talented smith ever and the one responsible for the Doom of Mandos. Now the majority of elves in Eregion were of the Noldor, there by falling under the Doom still set in place on the High Elves of Middle Earth. I believe that the Gwaith-i-Mírdain were seeking a means to circumlocute the Doom of The Valar, since the three Great Elven rings had the power to make their realms used therein seem timeless.

 ""Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just is. A remarkable place altogether."" - Bilbo to Frodo on his stay in Rivendel


Also in Lothlorien none of the fellowship could figure out how much time had passed when they were in Calas Galadhon.


A quote from Elrond: ""But maybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will fade and be forgotten."" - Said to Gloin at Council of Elrond.


Both realms, Rivendel and Lothlorien were not only ruled by an elf with a Great ring, but one of the Noldor. (Elrond's elvish half was Noldor) So I believe the Doom of the Valar was a very real and troubling thing for their leaders. BUT and this is a very big but. SO WOULD THEIR RINGS. Being made by Noldoli and the grandson of Feanor no less. So here is the thing The Great Ring, The One, was forged by Sauron alone. He's not an elf, certainly not of the Noldor so his Ring wouldn't fall under the Doom right? WRONG.


Under Celebrimbor's rule (after Galadriel and Celeborn left for Lothlorien) a certain ""Lord of Gifts"", Annatar, came to them professing a want to help the Noldor make middle-earth as beautiful as the undying lands. And for a while it was the truth. He helped them and they helped him fueling each others ""arts"" of creation, they made Eregion a beautiful city and without Annatar the Noldor could never have reached the peak of their Ring-craft and the Apex of the Three Elven Rings (which I believe as stated earlier could some how hold off the doom of mandos) but here's the catch. Annatar was Sauron in disguise and he crafted the One so it would be the master of all the lesser rings. But here is something you might not know, the noldor taught Sauron as much as he taught them. His Ring was forged through noldor lore and could have only been wrought with the knowledge that they provided. Otherwise what had been the point of Annatar befriending the noldor in the first place? So I maintain that the One was in fact a work of the Noldor and would have fallen under the doom of Mandos

""On the House of Fëanor the wrath of the Valar lieth from the West unto the uttermost East""


and


""To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well; and by treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they ever be for ever.""


Two parts of the doom of the Valar

Then I saw it in my library about four days ago and I have already read up to Turin, and just finished children of hurin.

Needless to say, I was surprised that the whole biblical thing was just that there was a creation story and it **wasn't written in an incomprehensible fashion**... I loved it

I know there are likely many parallels to bibles that you could bring up but I think the point is that the Silmarillion is not unintelligible, it is rather coherent and so much better than I conceived.

Also, someone asked me by PM exactly how I chose the winner, so in the interests of transparency... Basically, I scored it like a short essay exam:

Q1: 2 points. Full credit awarded if you mentioned that Eärendil was Elrond's father. Most people got this.

Q2: 5 points. This was the one with the widest spread, as some folks didn't know that this referred to the Elessar, the stone that Galdriel gives to Aragorn when the Company leaves Lothlórien. The difference between four and five points was elaborating on the history of the stone, and noting the ambiguity in Tolkien's writings about whether the stone given to Aragorn was the original from Gondolin or not. Four people got the full five points.

Q3: 5 points. This proved to be the real tie-breaker: Most people lost a point by not knowing that there are alternative stories of what became of Tuor and Idril. Only one person got the full five points (/u/kzsummers, the eventual winner), although there were a lot of 4-point scores.

Q4: 3 points. The obvious answer (at least to me...), and the one that most people gave, is the light of Eärendil's star captured in the Phial of Galadriel. Partial credit was awarded for other sensible answers.

Tie-Breaker: 5 points. Eärendil originated in Cynewulf's poem *Crist* (usually called *Christ II*), in the lines, 

&gt; Eala  Earendel engla beorthast

&gt; Ofer middangeard monnum sended

(""Hail, Earendel, brightest of angels, over Middle-earth sent unto men."") Lots of people got this right, so it didn't work all that well as a tie-breaker.

Thorin basically says that he's not going to negotiate under the threat of force, which seems fair. Bard then demands at least 1/12th of the treasure or he'll starve the dwarves out.

As for Bard's claims, I think the only one that really holds water is that the wealth of Dale was also mixed into the treasure, but that's something that needs to be discussed and negotiated, not simply demanded under the threat of an invading army.

KindlyKickRocks	44	7	31	"So it's been a while since I've formally read the LOTR, Silmarillion, but I went on a Tolkiengateway binge yesterday and I remembered this issue that I had, which is why does it seem like the elves (and men for that matter) in the First Age are way stronger than those of the end of the Third Age?

For example, we're all familiar with Fingolfin vs Morgoth. Morgoth was the greatest of the Valar, many times stronger than Sauron, yet he was wounded 7 times. We have Ecthelion, who slew many Balrogs including Gothmog, the lord of all Balrogs, while Gandalf died fighting just one after days of fighting. There are many more examples, but I don't want to go listing every badass.

My main theory is that the Noldor, or the Eldar for that matter, are more powerful than their Avari kin. They've seen the Two Trees and studied under the Valar and Maia. Off the top of my head, all the powerful elf lords mentioned in LOTR seem to be of the Noldor (Elrond, Cirdan, Galadriel). I can't recall mention of great power from Thranduil or Celeborn, and those are the Sindar elf lords.

So here we go; in the movie for RoTK, Bilbo asks Frodo if he can see the ring again. What I'm wondering is if in the books Bilbo was aware of what had happened with Frodo or not? I just watched the movie and it hit me that everyone across the lands would have known what Frodo did and that the ring was finally destroyed and Sauron was gone for good. I haven't read the books in a year or so since I left home but I've watched the film several times which has probably skewed my memories.

I figured I might as well give it another try now that I'm in college; see if I would be able to enjoy it.

Long story short, I'm thoroughly enjoying it. But I discovered something absolutely insane.

So, I was trying to figure out a way to immerse myself in Tolkien's world as much as possible while reading what is essentially a book of mythology. I hit upon an idea.

I'm not sure if many of you have played **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** before, but I enjoy it quite a lot. One thing in particular that has always stood out for me in this game was the soundtrack; it quite honestly contains some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.

My idea was to put on some headphones and use Skyrim's music as a soundtrack to my reading experience. I couldn't possibly have imagined at this point the sheer beauty and wonder that this music would add to the book. I'll give you a few examples that blew me away.

When Morgoth sent out his armies to destroy the goodly Elves in the chapter ""Of the Ruin of Beleriand"", this song began to play: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5gGKAg7jqY

It was so incredibly saddening that I was literally almost moved to tears.

This track played at the first meeting of Beren and Lúthien: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo3VAltxlr8&amp;feature=relmfu

Again, strikingly beautiful. I could almost picture Lúthien in all her beauty dancing in the woods of Doriath.

This is where it gets eerie. When Beren cuts the Silmaril from Morgoth's crown, this song played when he touched it and was stricken with awe by its mystery: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cfzj80iNLc

Simply terrifying. But it gets better. When the great wolf Carcharoth bites off Beren's hand and swallows the Silmaril, he descends into a great murderous madness. This song played immediately: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eAQK64CuLY

I was very freaked out at this point, but it gets **even more awesome.** At the 49-second mark of this song, there's this sweet violin part. The violin part began *immediately* when Thorondor and the Eagles descended to bear Beren and Lúthien away from Angband.

That's as far as I am in the book at the moment, but I am completely blown away by how much more immersed in the story I became as a result of this small idea.

So this is a drinking game I put together for a bunch of friends on a study abroad program when we discovered that we were all giant LotR nerds.  Some of these rules are from the internet, but a lot of em are mine.  Basically each person is assigned a role as one member of the fellowship and drinks whenever your character does a certain things. Additionally there are everyone rules during which everyone drinks when something happens.  Please note that this game should be played with beer or something of similarly strong APV, as playing it with anything stronger can result in extreme drunkenness.  Basically everyone (especially Gandalf) will be trashed beyond measure and everyone blacked out around Amon Hen when we last did it.  It is a ton of fun with a bunch of tolkein geeks, so drink up and enjoy!

When the fellowship is trapped in the guard room. In the book, something tries to get into the barred door. Boromir tries to hack at it but fails. Frodo yells 'for the shire' and stabs its foot with Sting and it retreats - Aragorn says 'The hobbit's bite is deep!' and something else.

Taarguss	33	0	23	"I just got back from watching Return of the King in the theater again (amazing amazing amazing) and something stuck out for me. I've been trying to get through The Silmarillion for a while and to tell you guys the truth... Sauron seems kind of... small.. compared to his Master. 

The whole War of the Ring seems almost petty compared to what Morgoth did in the First Age. Not that Sauron wasn't a horrible tyrant who would have utterly ruined Middle-Earth forever had he won the war, but when you realize that Arda has seen a far greater evil... it just doesn't have the same impact.

It's almost post-apocalyptic. In a way. Like.. The Middle-Earth we see from the Second Age onward is like the remnants of the apocalyptic world-changing events that ended the First Age. And it just seems like Sauron is trying to take over this broken world.

I know this isn't a great question to ask, but should Morgoth's actions even have been written about? I don't want to have this knowledge that there was way worse stuff than Sauron. It takes a lot away from Lord of the Rings. 

Or maybe Morgoth should have just stayed in Valinor. Because his reign of terror happened in the mortal realm... I don't know.. If it had been completely other-worldly, than it could have been more like mythology. Instead it's like history. To me, Morgoth is like Hitler and Sauron is like Kim Jong Il. Both are shitty people, but one is WAY worse.

Or maybe Morgoth should have been the antagonist in LOTR. That would have been way scarier than his lieutenant. SOMEONE TALK ME OUT OF THIS. I need a reason to be very afraid of Sauron."	t5_2r6jm	True

Tayend	37	7	7	"I was lucky enough to visit the exterior set for Hobbiton at Matamata, New Zealand, earlier this year. We were one of the last tours before the site was closed down for filming and what an amazing place it was! The guides had some amazing stories about the set, here are some I thought you may like:

* Sean Astin used to go to the farm every year for Christmas with the landowners,

* The flora on site had to be specially imported from England (obviously to properly represent the Shire): there 
were strict rules set in place by the New Zealand government to stop any unwanted ""side effects"" taking place,

* All the fruit trees on the farm were figs - the figs were digitally altered in post-processing to resemble pears!

* The old tree above Bag End was actually dead wood constructed offsite and pinned together when it reached the film set,

* the grove of trees you first meet Frodo in (reading a book in FotR) is actually about 10 miles away from the rest of Hobbiton,

* a party of people all dressed up as Arwen once descended on the guides and demanded to be allowed to dance around the Party Tree, for hours...

* Much like the pear/fig trees - the Party Tree is a New Zealand native, and had to have its leaves digitally changed to resemble oak leaves,

* They once had a 7ft man dressed up as Bilbo go around the set, deadly serious. 

* I spotted (upon a new part of Hobbiton made especially for ""The Hobbit"") a Hobbit hole with what looked like boat oars sitting outside - the guide admitted not knowing why a Hobbit hole in Hobbiton would have these but also let slip that other parts of the Shire would be filmed using these Hobbit holes.

1355421289.0	14smj0	Can we discuss The Hobbit here? I mean with spoilers and all. YES THIS HAS SPOILERS	Llamacalypse	36	3	72	"Just got home from the theather. What a great-great movie, I wasn't disappointed at all. I was laughing, excited, emotional, everything. The meeting of the White Council represented pretty well what Gandalf tells in the books. Orcs are great, Dwarfs are not the main comedic relief, and Bilbo is pretty much the whiny bitch it's suppossed to be in the first half of the story. Also stone giants were fucking A.

As another thread said, I think it does a pretty fine job telling the story of the book without being the book, pretty much in the sense that stories change according to the person telling them.

Also, I get that the inclusions of certain parts, like Bilbo saving Thorin's life at the end, are necessary as devices for film storytelling. However, I don't understand why Jackson insists on distorting small parts of the history of Middle-Earth to include those devices. Why is Azog still alive? He perfectly could've used a big orc that wasn't supossed to be dead for a century. I imagine Thorin or Dain will kill him in the Battle of the Five Armies. 

Also, why is Dol Guldur only recently been reoccupied? Making it like Tolkien said wouldn't have changed anything, but this way they cannot explain that Gandalf visited Thráin in those dungeons and thus got the key and map.

The sequence about Erebor is simply fantastic, one of the best thing I've seen, the movie was just starting and I was already wowed. The same about the battle of Azanulbizar, specially with Azog holding Thror's head.

I think the movie really captures the spirit of the book, as it being more childish and funny, with things like all the singing and Radagast's sleigh (I was actually worried about the treatmen of this character but it seemed pretty spot on). Weird stuff was added anyway, but not disrupting anything, like Thranduil riding a fucking Megaloceros.

Only one doubt remains: the orc tongue that's spoken on the film, where does it come from?

However I'm really happy, I expected more stupid stuff like the sequence of Legolas and the Mumakil on ROTK, but I think they managed the book-Hollywood dichotomy pretty well.

1325055263.0	ntbwy	"thanks to discussions with other redditors, i think i know what ""extra"" scenes will be in the movie (and why galadrial is there)"	davidsmeaton	34	1	38	"in ""the hobbit"" trailer, there's a lot of hostility by thorin that isn't explained in the book. there's also gandalf wandering around alone and talking to galadrial. 

after talking to other tolkienfans, i've done some more reading and found ""the quest for erebor"" in the unfinished tales. the story describes 'the hobbit' from gandalf's point of view.

mostly, gandalf talks about two problems: the necromancer (sauron's) growing power, and smaug. gandalf figures that sauron and smaug would work together ... so gandalf (after accidentally bumping into thorin on the road) devises a plan to try and take smaug out of the picture. 

gandalf's main worry is that sauron is already powerful enough to launch an attack on rivendell and lorien; a war which he believes sauron would win. gandalf sees himself as the one who has to make the attack on dol guldur happen. he believes that saruman isn't interested and is actually focused on finding the ring (which some people - sauron and saruman - suspect may have been found). 

that's probably where galadrial comes in - because of her concerns/fears that lorien will be attacked. as a result, gandalf convinces the white council to attack dol guldur, which they do, and force sauron to flee to mordor - resulting in sauron focusing his attack on gondor instead. 

back to thorin, gandalf hadn't seen bilbo in 20 years and didn't know how ""soft"" bilbo had become. when the dwarves visited bilbo's house, the hobbit panicked and acted a fool. after bilbo went to sleep gandalf and thorin argued about the hobbit. thorin hated the idea and gandalf basically threatened that if thorin didn't take bilbo, the quest would fail. thorin eventually relented and everything worked out.

so, i think the movie is going to have a few intertwining pieces. there will be some history (galdalf's visit to dol guldur 9 years earlier when he received the key and map from thrain) ... there'll be some stuff about the fight with sauron and the threat to lorien and rivendell. there'll be the argument with thorin and decision to take bilbo.

i'm still re-reading the hobbit right now and it's going to be really amazing. i'm looking forward to seeing how they put it all together!

1363653311.0	1ak7q9	"the ""concerning hobbits"" pages in the prologue of lotr.. i had to suggest to a friend skipping it, since it was putting him off the series. what are people's thoughts on it?"	xOohShinyThing	38	10	32	"after reading lotr, hobbit, and sill, i find the ""concerning hobbits"" bit out of place; it seems like something you'd find in the appendix. the reason it came to my mind was when i realised just how off-putting it was at the beginning of the book to a first-time reader. it reads like a textbook, going into great depth regarding lineage and historical events that have little relevance to the next part of the story.

my friend wanted to read the series, and i lent him my book. he came to return it the next day, saying that he couldn't get into it, despite loving the movies. i asked him where he got to, and he said ""it was just talking about hobbit history and such, it seems so bland."". after telling him to skip the prologue to the party chapter, he got carried away reading straight away. i felt bad, telling him to skip part of the book to get into it..

What exactly does the One Ring do for Sauron?  I thought the original purpose was to be able to control the other Rings of Power.  But it didn't work on Elves or Dwarves, and the Men have already become Nazgul.  So what would have happened if he got his hands on the Ring?

What exactly does the Ring do for another bearer?  I just don't understand what powers or abilities the Ring gives to an individual.  If Galadriel had taken the Ring, what would have happened?  Or Gandalf.  Or even Boromir.

Why does the Ring make someone invisible, but not Sauron?  Is it because Sauron has full control over the Ring's powers?

Finally, what exactly is Valinor?  I figure it's some sort of heaven on earth.  But do the Elves that go there die?  What about Frodo?  Does he basically die on the ship on the way over and live in the afterlife?  What about those Elves that died in Middle-Earth.  Are they admitted to Valinor?"	t5_2r6jm	True
1355257037.0	14ok96	Watched a pre-screening of the Hobbit last night... spoiler free review.	RC212	35	4	27	"Peter Jackson and company did what they do, made a beautiful wonderful movie that is ""based on the book"" but not a movie ""of the book"". I think that as long as you can go into the film knowing that it is not going to be perfectly accurate, there is not much room for disappointment. 

There are some wonderful cameos of both characters and locations from the previous LOTR films. The pacing was spot on, there was never a moment that I felt the need to check my watch to see how long a scene was taking. 

The more I reflect on the character trait misses that frustrated me last night, the more I can see that this may have been the only way to convey the inner struggle that said characters had voiced in the book. 

When it was all said an done however, the first thing I said was ""Let's watch it again!"" and I think that is a real testament to the quality of this film. 

Oh, and the 3d was the most intense and dazzling that I have yet to experience.

1372652414.0	1henyg	Just wanted to share this awesome piece from The Children of Hurin	AnorOmnis	36	7	7	"""*Then Turin knelt and drank from that water, and suddenly he cast himself down, and his tears were unloosed at last, and he was healed of his madness.*""

This passage made me just stop and put down the book for a minute. It isn't much without context, so I'll provide it. Turin is shown as an unmistakably strong and stoic character in this book, a stern warrior. While we are told of the pity he has in his heart, we do not yet see it as a major competitor with his steely resolve.

At this stage in the book, Turin has mistakenly slain Beleg Cuthalion, the Elf that has one of his best friends since he met him years ago in Doriath. Immediately after the killing, he just slumps down and stops speaking. A darkness climbs over him, and he does not cry, and does not mourn, but remains completely still and silent.

And then, they come to the Eithel Irvin, a lake guarded by Ulmo the Vala, where endless laughter is said to run. Turin's companion bids him to drink from it and be healed, and then the passage comes in. 

To me, this is the first sure proof of the existence of Turin's compassionate side. He finally weeps for his fallen friend and is cured ""of his madness"". It's such an important step in the building of his character, and IMO, one of the best pieces of writing in the entire book. Not even the death of Beleg hurt me as much as Turin's tears. The closest parallel I can think of is this one from the TV show LOST (SPOILERS UP AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU INTEND TO WATCH LOST/HAVE NOT FINISHED LOST)

For me it is my favourite incarnation of Lord of the Rings and I return to it yearly. I'd say the voice acting is close to perfect (the only exception that springs to mind is Arwen). The script captures the language/feel of the book/characters but cuts out some of the over written or weaker passages.

The Grey Havens are right there, to the west of the Shire.  And Cirdan was legit, being a former ring-bearer himself.  Gandalf's instruction to Frodo to go to Rivendell seems odd, considering it is over twice the distance.  Then, from the Grey Havens, they could take ships all the way to Dol Amroth.  Or, even after the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the far safer route would've been back west to the Grey Havens and then just on the ocean.  
  
So, was such an option ever discussed in the books or in Tolkien's notes?  Does it seem like it could've worked, or are there dangers to such a route that would've derailed it?

I remember that I attempted to-- Keep in mind I was 7.  I thought they were too hard to understand.  And I never went back.

Honestly, I just never gave this series much more thought, in the back of my mind I always thought it was difficult to read, long descriptive passages that went nowhere.  I don't know how much of that was shaped by my attempt at 7 years old and how much was from other people around me who tried it.

Well, last week, I was combing the thrift store for books and there was a beautiful set of the three Lord of the Rings books.  Somehow, my interest was peaked and I bought them.  I don't think I was even sure I would read them, but they were so nice looking. But, when I got them home, I thought that I really ought to give them a shot, if nothing else, just to say that I attempted to read them.  

Well, I'm blown away.  I don't remember the last time I have loved a book as much as this one.  I am just finishing up the Fellowship of the Ring, they are leaving Lorien.  There are long descriptive passages, but I just love them and feel completely transported to this world.  

The wonderful thing is that I've only seen the first two movies, somehow we missed the Return of the King.  So, I have no idea how this epic tale ends and I will get to experience that through the book.  

Now I wish I would have started with the Hobbit, but, alas, I did not.  I will go back and read that after this series.

Anyway, I just thought I'd share my excitement over these books with someone who would appreciate it, I tell my husband and he looks at me, ""well, honey, they sound like good books.""

1324609769.0	nngs6	Is there more to Bilbo's luck than mere good fortune?	kyzf42	28	3	11	"I was listening to the Tolkien Professor's [hobbit lecture series](http://www.tolkienprofessor.com/lectures/hobbit_series/hobbit_home.html) today -- which, by the way, is fantastic and you should check it out if you haven't already -- and he was talking about the repeated references throughout *The Hobbit* to Bilbo's inordinate amount of lucky coincidences, from the beginning of his adventures to the very end.  The way he stumbled upon the Ring and bested Gollum's riddles, for one.  
  
The extremely improbably discovery of the moon letters on Thrain's map is another example, and Bilbo just *happening* to be in the right place at the right time to hear the thrush (who was of an ""ancient and magical race"") knock.  Such things seemed preordained, or somehow orchestrated, as if a greater plan is in place.  In a typical story you could point to ""destiny"" as your answer, but Tolkien's universe has a whole pantheon of higher beings who could be silently watching and meddling in events, like moving pieces on a chessboard.  
  
Was Bilbo groomed from the start to play this part in a scripted series of events designed to culminate in Sauron's downfall?  Is that why Gandalf insisted the dwarves bring him along in the first place?"	t5_2r6jm	True
1324572820.0	nmrq6	A question about an interesting passage in the Two Towers concerning unmentionable creatures.	imjusgunmakethisquik	32	4	24	"I noticed an interesting passage in the White Rider chapter in the Two Towers. Gandalf is giving his account of his battle with the Balrog when he says this:
"" Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels. They were not made by Durin's Folk, Gimli son of Gloin. Far, far below the deepest delvings of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless things. Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he.""

The last sentence of this passage is very strange. As one of the Ainur, Sauron came to being as an offspring of the thought of Eru Illuvatar, before even the creation of Middle Earth. This creates many questions about these ""nameless things"" that are apparently older than the Ainur. Were these things too created by Eru, or did they come to be in another way? How did they come to live in Middle Earth if they have existed for so much longer? Also, how would Gandalf ever find knowlege of them beyond observing their tunnels? He appears to know a bit of their history which even Sauron, the most powerful the Maia, does not know. I doubt anyone has firm answers to this but it makes for some interesting thought."	t5_2r6jm	True

1375940368.0	1jxtgc	Lore Contest III: Question 3	ebneter	27	2	20	"Was Galadriel still under exile during the Third Age?

Was Galadriel *ever* under exile? Galadriel, somewhat like Faramir, was a character that turned up in *The Lord of the Rings* without ever existing anywhere else; despite the occasional mention of her in the published *Silmarillion*, she did not, in fact, exist in Tolkien's pre-*Lord of the Rings* mythology. At some point during the writing, however, he decided that she was a Noldorin Elf, a decision that created some complications: Why was one of the High Noldor still in Middle-earth?

This is another question that many think has a canonical answer, because, after her temptation by the Ring, Galadriel says, ""I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel,"" implying that there is no ban on her return. Yet later, when bidding Frodo and the Company farewell, she sings, ""But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me? What ship would ever bear me back across so wide a Sea?"" suggesting that she is at the very minimum uncertain of her status.

If Galadriel was uncertain, so was Tolkien. In ""Notes and Translations,"" his essay in *The Road Goes Ever On* about ""Namarië"" and ""A Elbereth, Gilthoniel!"", he writes:

&gt; The question *Sí man i yulma nin enquantuva?* and the question at the end of her song (Vol. I, p. 389), *What ship would ever bear me back across so wide a Sea?*, refer to the special position of Galadriel. She was the last survivor of the princes and queens who had led the revolting *Noldor* to exile in Middle-earth. After the overthrow of *Morgoth* at the end of the First Age a ban was set upon her return, and she had replied proudly that she had no wish to do so.

Yet, later, Tolkien began to question this idea, and in other writings he speculated that while Galadriel had been a willing participant in the departure from Valinor, she had not participated in the events that would have led to such a perpetual ban, notably the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and so she was in Middle-earth of her own free will. But that, of course, would have contradicted published work stating the contrary. In his last writings, Tolkien seems to have gone to an extreme to free Galadriel of even the slightest taint of the Exiles, suggesting that she (and possibly Celeborn) had come to Middle-earth separately from Fëanor's group!

The question is thus completely unresolved, unless one wishes to take *The Road Goes Ever On* as canonical.

From what I understand Gandalf is kind of a demi god?  If Galadriel is ""just"" an elf, why does Gandalf seem to consider himself on equal, or lower standing to her, especially in that scene in The Hobbit involving Elrond and Saruman?

From wikipedia I understand she is around 3000 years old, royalty and was the mother of other Elves that had a massive impact on the world. However apart from her ability to see into someones minds and age I can't seem to find anything that makes her ""special"".

Does it purely come down to the things I have mentioned or is there something else I am missing?

EDIT: Thank you for your responses! So, yes they do have free will (but in a limited capacity, seeing as they may be incapable of doing good anyway). But orcs may indirectly cause good (by, say, fighting amongst themselves and causing discord in Sauron/Morgoth's army). I wonder now what happens when an orc dies, or indeed if they do have fëar at all.

Take this with a grain of salt. I am fully aware of who and what Melkor is and what horrible acts he has committed. I am not saying he is not worthy of his title, this is just a fun musing I'm hoping could start an interesting discussion on my favorite Dark Lord.

Is Melkor really the bad guy here? I mean we all know where he ends up, Morgoth the Black Enemy of the World and his truly dark actions there in are not what I'm calling into question here but more back to the beginning where it all started. In Eru's harmonies. ""Mighty are the Ainur, and mightiest among them is Melkor"", who was the bravest being thus far ever created because he alone conceived and acted upon the concept of challenging that which he was presented with. He questioned the space around him, he did not accept the picture painted for him by Eru. Too eager to learn the true nature of existence and not willing to accept the one and only way painted by this higher power even though unlike most Melkor knew the divine to be real and had looked upon him and knew full well his power and majesty without question but he still chose to close his eyes to Eru. He challenged God's plan not necessarily to harm or cause grief at first but simply to try his hand, to explore his capabilities, to push himself to unforeseen heights, to question. And this I really feel for because it's very similar to my fall out with religion as a child etc. This is where i started to see kinship in Melkor, a kind of understanding of where he was coming from. He did not see why he could not rise to equal or higher standing than Eru himself and is that not similar to our actions as a species, constantly changing and submitting our own harmonies to natures pre established ones. Tearing up the world and building our own form of it, straining to climb higher, to stand akin with god as equals both as creators of life and sculptors of nature. This was Melkor's intent, what he set out to do. But he was persecuted for his desires, looked down upon, cast out. He was pushed to the darkness, pushed to the edge where he could only continue his quest and his research in evil for that was all that was left to him and sadly in this place he fell into darkness and became a Dark Lord musing in the destruction and torture of life and beauty. But Melkor had  led the drive for experimentation and exploration free of the direction or constraints of Eru and thus operating under true freedom. But all who lay under Eru's outstretched arms fought against Melkor's ways tooth and nail, choosing instead to remain ignorant and exactly as they had been made, never climbing higher than the mark set for them. And for his curiosity and his bravery or more ultimately his evil and malice he was cast  into outer darkness where he could no longer question Eru's plan or pull the veil back from another sheep in the flock for all time... Thoughts?   

*EDIT: Awesome comments!! Very impressed and humbled by some of your Tolkien knowledge!! Love all the fantastic information on Melkor that exploded forth. Hes such an interesting villain. Keep it up! Cheers!

I would love to know more about Eru's feelings on Melkor and the path he chose to take as Melkor was after all Eru's creation. Would be so interesting to know what Eru would say to Melkor after he commited all his atrocities. Why did you have to die Tolkien! :("	t5_2r6jm	True

1375937203.0	1jxqaj	Lore Contest III: Question 1	ebneter	22	0	18	"Who was Tom Bombadil?

In the Primary World, of course, Tom Bombadil was originally a doll owned by one of Tolkien's sons; Tolkien, in typical fashion, turned him into a poem, originally published in the *Oxford Magazine* on 13 February 1934. When he began writing the sequel to *The Hobbit*, he put Bombadil in as part of the traveling hobbits' first great adventure in the Old Forest, believing, as he did at the time, that he was still writing a children's book. But he was not, of course, and Bombadil became something of an oddity in the Secondary World.

But Tolkien did not remove him, because he makes for a smooth transition between the domestic tranquility of the Shire and the wild world beyond, and because he represented something — to Tolkien, at least — that Tolkien felt was important. In Letter 154, Tolkien wrote,

&gt; In historical fact I put him in because I had already 'invented' him independently (he first appeared in the Oxford Magazine) and wanted an 'adventure' along the way. But I kept him in, and as he was, because he represents certain things otherwise left out. I do not mean him to be an allegory — or I should not have given him so particular, individual, ridiculous a name — but 'allegory' is the only mode of exhibiting certain functions: he is then an 'allegory', or an exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science: the spirit that desires knowledge of other things, their history and nature, *because they are 'other'* and wholly independent of the enquiring mind, a spirit coeval with the rational mind, and entirely unconcerned with 'doing' anything with the knowledge: Zoology and Botany not Cattle-breeding or Agriculture. ... Also T.B. exhibits another point in his attitude to the Ring, and its failure to affect him. You must concentrate on some part, probably relatively small, of the World (Universe), whether to tell a tale, however long, or to learn anything however fundamental ... The power of the Ring overall all concerned, even the Wizards or Emissaries, is not a delusion — but it is not the whole picture, even of the then state and content of that part of the Universe.

But *what*, precisely, Bombadil actually *was* in the Secondary World was something Tolkien chose not to answer: Famously, in Letter 144, he wrote, 

&gt; ...even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are. Tom Bombadil is one (intentionally).

In case you were wondering, that is the canonical answer: He is an enigma; there *is* no answer.

But what might he have been? Tolkien was also very explicit that there was no incarnation of Eru Ilúvatar in Middle-earth, for that would conflict with the Gospel, and Tolkien was nothing if not a deeply Christian man. Various suggestions have been raised — he is a side-product of the music of the Ainur; he is a Vala (Aule being the usual suspect); he is a Maia (they are conveniently plentiful, although there are certain contradictions with this notion); he is [the Witch-king of Angmar](http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/theories/bombadil.htm); he's [an evil being older than Morgoth](http://km-515.livejournal.com/1042.html); he's some other sort of spirit. Any of these could be true, but the evidence isn't very good for any of them.

In any event, it's kind of funny that Bombadil gets so much attention in this regard, because he's hardly the only sentient being whose origins Tolkien is at best vague on. Where did the Ents come from? How about Ungoliant? Talking Eagles and other birds? Wargs? Trolls? Stone giants? Even Goldberry! Eh? No one ever seems to wonder about *them*... ;-)

Nearly every other medieval technology is present, from siege equipment to clocks. This one example brings out the obvious fact that throughout the whole history of Ea science seems to be at a standstill.  Tolkien has said that his world was not intended to be examined scientifically, and that if one looks too closely they would discover 'bones in the soup', or something similar (I can't remember exactly).

scientific method nonexistent?  How could Elves who spend thousands of years learning miss such a simple invention?

That's a really good question. A lot of people think this has a canonical answer, but it really doesn't, because Tolkien changed his mind about it. Frequently. The answer given in the published *Silmarillion*, and taken up by Peter Jackson in his films, is that Morgoth bred Orcs from captured Elves back in the First Age. This isn't canonical, however, because in assembling the published *Silmarillion*, Christopher Tolkien had to edit together writings from many different times and different conceptions his father had of his world. In particular, he felt obliged to include ""a"" single origin for Orcs rather than deal with the difficulties of his father's thought on the subject.

And difficult it was. In the very earliest tales of Middle-earth (specifically, *The Fall of Gondolin* from *The Book of Lost Tales*, Orcs were bred by Morgoth ""from the heats and the slimes of the earth."" But Tolkien decided that Evil could not create, and that, indeed, only Ilúvatar could create sentient creatures — Aule's Dwarves were not sentient until Eru made them so. And whatever else they were, Orcs were clearly sentient. Moreover, when he put goblins into *The Hobbit*, he established that they could *breed* — Bolg was the son of Azog. And since the only sentient creatures about in the First Age early enough to make Orcs out of were Elves, he initially settled on the notion that Orcs were corrupted Elves.

But he realized fairly quickly that this idea was problematical, for a number of reasons, chief of which was simply that Elves are immortal; the idea of immortal Orcs was troublesome and provided some interesting complications for Tolkien's ideas about Elvish and Mannish afterlife. (There is no question, though, that Orcs — some of them, at least — lived long lives; Bolg was alive some 140 years after the death of his father Azog; and various things in both *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* suggest that they might live even longer.) Tolkien dabbled with other ideas, including that Orcs were merely ""dumb"" beasts animated by the will of Morgoth or Sauron (contradicted by their apparent autonomy in the absence and even presence of either of those beings, not to mention Saruman's Orcs); that they were corrupted Men, although that fell afoul of the timeline of the First Age; that they were fallen Maiar, at least in origin, who then bred physically like Melian; or ... but he never decided. So, while one can speculate, there is no definitive answer. (Near the end of his life Tolkien seemed to be leaning towards the idea that Orcs were bred from Men, with all of the rewriting of the history of the First Age that would have required; but obviously nothing ever came of this.)"	t5_2r6jm	True

1367283276.0	1ddn1o	Thoughts on the Akallabeth and Men	doncs	22	3	7	"No real points to make, just some musings. Sorry for the wall of text.

So I read the Silmarillion a long time ago, but I recently decided to read it again. I absolutely love it, and it is one of my favorite books. But I've been thinking most about the Akallabeth, and how tragic and sad it is. When I realize just how far the Numenoreans fell given where their ancestors came from, it leaves a sort of empty feeling in you, and pity for fictional characters, which isn't something I would normally feel.

The themes that run through the book- Man's fear of death and discontent with good- are powerful to say the least. After the Silmarillion and reading about all the shit the Edain went through because of Morgoth and Sauron, I loved reading about Men being happy, content, and shunning the war-mongering and desire for dominance over others that defined the Dark Powers:

&gt; For the Dúnedain became mighty in crafts, so that if they had had the mind they could easily 
have surpassed the evil kings of Middle-earth in the making of war and the forging of weapons; but 
they were become men of peace

Then later in the story, we get this:

&gt;And they sailed now with power and armoury to Middle-earth, and they came no longer as bringers of gifts, nor even as rulers, but as fierce men of war. And they hunted the men of 
Middle-earth and took their goods and enslaved them, and many they slew cruelly upon their altars. For they built in their fortresses temples and great tombs in those days; and men feared them, and the memory of the kindly kings of the Elder Days faded from the world and was darkened by many 
a tale of dread.

Major difference, and it makes you wonder what their ancestors the Edain would have thought of them. And after their hubris and willingness to listen to Sauron (who was the enemy of the Edain) brought about the destruction of their country, they are reduced to living in Exile, wandering the seas looking for memories of things that used to be:

&gt; For the Dúnedain held that even mortal Men, if so blessed, might look upon other times than 
those of their bodies' life; and they longed ever to escape from the shadows of their exile and to see 
in some fashion the light that dies not; for the sorrow of the thought of death had pursued them over the deeps of the sea. Thus it was that great mariners among them would still search the empty seas, hoping to come upon the Isle of Meneltarma, and there to see a vision of things that were. But they found it not. And those that sailed far came only to the new lands, and found them like to the old 
lands, and subject to death. And those that sailed furthest set but a girdle about the Earth and returned weary at last to the place of their beginning; and they said: 'All roads are now bent.'

So I'm just rambling now. But the I thought the story was beautiful, and sad, which only made it more beautiful. Did anybody else fell the same way, or think differently? Also, I've been wondering about how real the fear of death and the discontent of people in times of good really is. But it's hard to make comparisons to Tolkiens works since they take place over long periods of time.

There is a very simple Primary World reason for this: The book would have been very short if they had. They either would have been defeated by flying Nazgûl or they would have quickly succeeded; either way, that's not much of a story! Tolkien was keenly aware of the dangers of using the Eagles as a *deus ex machina* solution. In Letter 210 (his scathing letter to Forrest J. Ackerman about the ""Zimmerman"" film treatment), he comments,

&gt; The Eagles are a dangerous 'machine'. I have used them sparingly, and that is the absolute limit of their credibility or usefulness.

The Secondary World explanation is, er, um, well, it's never actually even mentioned as a possibility, so there isn't one. Many people come up with various explanations — the Eagles are a proud race, not a taxi service; they're servants of Manwë and would be interfering in the internal politics of Middle-earth; Sauron would have seen them coming; etc. Possibly the thought simply didn't occur to anyone, as one of the contestants suggests. Moreover, the Eagles do have limitations; Gwaihir tells Gandalf he's meant for bearing news, not burdens, and can't carry him too far, suggesting that even with the Eagles involved it would have been a multi-day affair.

I mean, if Tolkien himself intended his stories to be a ""sandbox"" for other authors to add on to, why do you think nobody has taken the initiative and added to this mythos? There are COUNTLESS stories that can be derived throughout the history of Arda, and stories that can be grown to a much larger potential (Like ""The Children of Hurin"").

There are so many different ways in which magic is presented. From blades that glow in the dark to mirrors that show the possible future. Spells that close or open doors, creatures that consist of shadow and fire.

Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but I would like to know how this works. Like the laws of physics, there's got to be some rules governing the use of magic. When Saruman and Gandalf battle each other, what determines whose magic is the strongest? Did Tolkien write at all about this?

I have to say that the visualisation of magic in the Peter Jackson movies didn't really satisfy me.

1364125365.0	1awr8z	Ruminating on the sins of Sauron	Ellorindas	22	3	14	"Good day, fellow Tolkienfans.

I've been re-reading the Silmarillion for the umpteenth time, and was considering the role that Sauron plays, and the sins that he commits. 
In Melkor's passages, there are often references to the worst crime that he commits (in the infamous passage about his creation of the Orcs, or the thoughts he has when Luthien is singing to him), but Sauron doesn't appear to share in this. 
Now, obviously, Sauron does commit very grievous crimes (setting up the Temple of Morgoth in Numenor with human sacrifices for example), and I'm not trying to belittle any of those by this discussion.
But, in the forging the rings of power, Sauron takes away the 'gift' of Iluvatar (death) from the nine powerful men that become the Ringwraiths - extending their lives and preventing them from dying. 

Could we consider this to be his worst sin, since he takes away the ability of those men to die, and to be united with Iluvatar beyond the physical world?"	t5_2r6jm	True

After watching the Rankin/Bass Return of the King, I noticed that Sauron's orcs had the red eye painted on their shields and stuff, and that PJ left this out of his film. He DID however put the white hand of Saruman on the uruk-hai, giving audiences a way of telling them all apart. I find it very odd that PJ, famous for his incredible attention to detail, as well as the phenomenal team at Weta Workshop and the prosthetics department and everything, left this out (and the mediocre animted movie didn't!). I am fairly certain that is is plainly described in the book - the orcs of Mordor are supposed to have the red eye painted on their shields, helmets, etc. 

Whenever I am defending PJ's movies, I always cite the attention to detail, and how despite all the plot changes, they NAILED the look and feel of middle-earth. This oversight is probably bugging me much more than it should. Perhaps they tried it out in pre-production and it looked silly, I don't know. I've seen all of the DVD special features many times, and it is never mentioned, nor did I spot the eye in any concept art of the orcs. Anyone else bothered by this?

But there is one thing I have never really understood. What is the big deal with the One Ring? Near the end they explained its destruction would destroy Sauron too, so I get that, but why would anyone else want it? How does it help?

Hope I don't anger anyone with this question. This just always bothered me."	t5_2r6jm	True

1358472688.0	16seye	History of Middle-Earth review? Is it right for me?	SleepyPanda1	19	1	6	"I have trouble understanding **EXACTLY** from the reviews I have read what this 12-book series is all about, can somebody care to elaborate?

For my Tolkien background: Limited. I am about halfway thru the LOTR trilogy. I have finished and am absolutely obsessed with the Simarillion (weird order of reading I know). 

I really love Tolkien's more mythological writings and his sort of ""storytime"" stuff, and still no less his more concrete, detailed writings that are exhibited in LOTR.

The reason why I am so interested in getting HOME (after I finish the trilogy) is because I am so fascinated with the detail in which Tolkien has created the world of Middle-Earth and all of its rich stories and characters. I was just wondering if HOME is the right choice for me in case I need to read some of his other works before I can fully appreciate those in HOME."	t5_2r6jm	True

(More in description)	AnorOmnis	26	6	61	"At one point, it is stated that Morgoth has grown so weak from investing his energy in his servants that even an elf lord like Fingolfin is able to challenge him, and even maim him. (I believe his foot was cut off)

At Sauron's prime it is implied that he is extremely powerful, beyond any of the other Maiar, and most definitely stronger than an elf lord.

My question is, would Morgoth in this weak stage  be able to defeat Sauron at the peak of his power? Personally, I don't think he'd be able to, and I'd like some discussion and debate to establish a solid answer."	t5_2r6jm	True

1356006077.0	155xcu	A quick question regarding The Children of Hurin	JimJamBimBam	20	2	17	"So, I recently finally got around to buying myself The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and The Children of Hurin (I'm a big fan of both LOTR and the Hobbit). I plan to read The Silmarillion first, but I can't help but feel like it would be better to read The Children of Hurin during The Silmarillion, instead of reading the shorter, less detailed version of the story in The Silmarillion (I feel like the more classically narrative-styled version featured in The Children of Hurin will have better suspense and emotion than that in The Silmarillion).

So, would it be worth it reading The Silmarillion partway through, and upon reaching the area covered in The Children of Hurin, stopping and reading that instead? Or should I not bother, and just read The Children of Hurin separately, after finishing The Silmarillion? And if I should stop partway through, at what point should I do so (chapter/paragraph)?

Thanks in advance for your advice :)"	t5_2r6jm	True

I know the Blue Wizards ended up in the East and were pretty much never heard from again, and supposedly they fell into evil. But recently I read that perhaps they may have had an important role during the War of the Ring, in which according to Tolkien, they helped disrupt Sauron's control in the East.

Id like to know more about them. Anybody here have anymore knowledge about these two?

Oh, and I was totally psyched at their mention in The Hobbit."	t5_2r6jm	True
