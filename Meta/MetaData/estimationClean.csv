Foust2014	54	9	5	"As it turns out, it's going to take *a lot* of rings to get this job done, so let's get down to the root of the problem: the playing cards.


As it turns out, there are a good number of ways to shuffle an ordinary deck of cards. There are 52 options for the first card, 51 options for the second, so on and so forth. Leaving a total of **52!** total combinations that need to be accounted for. This leaves us with an mind-crunching, intuition-shattering **8 x 10^67** decks of cards to make. 

This is going to take a lot of paper.

Let's assume the average mass of a deck of 52 standard paper playing cards is around **94g** (Wikipedia), and its solid paper. All of our playing cards together will take around **7.58 x 10^66** kg of paper.


__________________________


Let's be generous here and assume that it's possible to turn 1 kg of raw tree into **0.5 kg** of paper, so we're going to need **1.5 x 10^67 kg** of trees. (About a trillion times more mass than in the known universe, by the way.)

Assuming a reasonably sized tree weighs about a metric ton, or 2000kg, we'll have to house about **7 x 10^63** trees. If we can cram these trees about a meter apart, we'll be taking up **7 x 10^63** square meters. 

Now to tackle the problem of actually holding all of these trees. A halo ringworld megastructure is truly a gargantuan feat of engineering. With a radius of around 10000 km and a width of around 100 km, these things should be able to serve as the ultimate space farms. 


__________________________

Each ring should grant us access to 10^4 x 10^3 x 10^2 x 10^3 x 2 x 3.14159 square meters of land, around one and half trillion acres. (**6.28 x 10^12 m^2** )

__________________________

Finally, we can divide **7 x 10^63 m^2** worth of trees among legendary megafarms that can hold 6.28 x 10^12 m^2 each. Leading us to conclude that we'll need **1.1 x 10^51** rings to get the job done.

If we pack each one of these bad boys together as close as they'll go without intersecting they'll take up a volume of around **10^70 m^3**. This would fill an empty cube with edges measuring some **twenty million light years** each. 

__________________________

Although this would be a terrible idea, even if we placed our megafarm on the other side of the observable universe - some 14 billion light years away - the mass of the trees alone would create a gravitational field strong enough to crush half of humanity into a puddle and fling the other half into space (also pretty much entirely flesh-paste). And we really wouldn't want to forget the part where it obliterates the planet itself, compressing it into a flat disc and flinging it into our also-destroyed sun. That's going to be bad too.

1362035505.0	19dvab	"Approximate ""gas mileage"" off the International Space Station"	clinically_cynical	48	5	8	"**Note:** This estimation is just based on all the launches to assemble the station, so I will not be including reboosts and resupply/crew transfer launches. Also, for simplicity's sake, I will convert the fuel from the Shuttle's SRBs to gallons. And finally, I make a lot of simplifications and assumptions, so don't expect this to be a close estimate, but it will at least be in the correct order of magnitude (hopefully). 

Total distance traveled = 2,182,930,000 miles

(Average velocity)(orbital period)(total number of orbits as of today) = (17,239.2 mi/h)(1.5472 hrs/orbit)(81842 orbits)

Total Fuel expended by assembly launch vehicles (very roughly) = 

**Vehicle 1: Proton-K**, Assumption = propellent is half fuel, half oxidizer

* 1st stage fuel mass burned = 419,410 kg N2O4/UDMH. At average of 1.1165 g/cm^3 this would equal 99,230 gallons.

* 2nd stage fuel mass burned = 156,113 kg N2O4/UDMH = 36940 gallons

* 3rd stage fuel mass burned = 46562 kg N2O4/UDMH = 11,020 gallons

**Total Proton-K gallons** = (2 launches) * (11020 + 36940 + 99230)gallons = 294,380 gallons

**Vehicle 2: Space Shuttle**, assumption that all missions burn same amount of fuel, and I will not calculate the OHMs burns as they are negligible compared to the SRBs and external tank.

* SRBs propellant mass = 500,000 kg at 69.6% ammonium perchlorate and 16% Aluminum (I'm ignoring the bonding and curing agents) = 102,120 gallons (Yes I know solids aren't measured in gallons but I'm calculating it like that anyways for the sake of this estimation)

* External tank = 541,762 gallons

**Total Space Shuttle Gallons** = (27 launches) * (541,762 + 102,120)gallons = 17,384,810 gallons

**There was one Soyuz U launch that added a small docking module to the station, but I can't find good fuel numbers for Soyuz U, so this is my most sinful assumption: I'm assuming the ratio of fuel volume to payload to LEO on the proton and soyuz are similar.**

With that assumption, Soyuz fuel volume = 22,080 gallons (probably way off)

**Total fuel used for assembly** = 17,701,270 gallons

**THEREFORE, total fuel efficiency of the Internation Space Station** = (2,182,930,000 miles)/(17,701,270 gallons)

**= 123.3 miles per gallon.**

This thing is 150 times the mass of your Hummer H2, and yet it gets over 12 times the fuel economy.

Answers ranged from 11 µL to 4 kL, with the median at 83 mL and quartiles at 40 and 140 mL.  Sources of energy calculations included average milelage, nuclear weapon yields and kilotons of TNT, peanut butter, and for our winner, relativistic mass-energy and the fine structure constant.  One smartass turned this into a rocket problem.

I searched for real-world measurements of this quantity, and found a 1980 EPA report which found a 1979 Chevy Nova (3750 lbs, similar to a light SUV now) consumed about [**250 mL of gasoline**](http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/9100WZVZ.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1976%20Thru%201980&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C76THRU80%5CTXT%5C00000019%5C9100WZVZ.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=6) to accelerate up to 55 miles per hour slowly and finish 1 mile of net distance.  A [Nova's mileage](http://www.aboutautomobile.com/Fuel/1979/Chevrolet/Nova) is similar to current-day SUV's, so I think this is a reasonable model car.

Only 3 of the estimates were above this and 15 below, but 13 out of 18 were within a factor of 10, which is great success for a Fermi problem.

**Edit 2:** [Another study, from 1982](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/2376/1/ITS353_WP162_uploadable.pdf) gives a formula for fuel use during acceleration: 

volume = 0.13 x speed^2 + 0.42 x speed/acceleration

 with volume in mL, speed in m/s, and acceleration in m/s^2.  That gives us **83 mL for 55 mph, which is exactly our median value.**  It also moves two more answers inside a factor of 10.


----

We're trying out a new feature here on /r/Estimation.  Each week we'll post a [Fermi problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) for you to try, and the winner will get **reddit gold!**

----


**Rules:**
----

The key to making Fermi problems interesting is to *not* go looking up accurate numbers.  They're about making daring estimates and assumptions, and seeing where they take you.  Therefore no outside resources of any kind are allowed, except for [this list of physical constants](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/reviews/rpp2012-rev-phys-constants.pdf) (pdf).  **You only get that list, whatever is in your brain already, and a calculator** (no fancy wolfram alpha shenanigans).

Obviously we can't enforce that rule very easily, so the winner will be determined not by the accuracy of the calculation, but by upvotes.  **Voters are asked to upvote the most elegant Fermi problem logic**, rather than absolute accuracy.  This means you have to **show and explain your work** to demonstrate how clever you are.

Each thread will be in contest mode for 1 week, after which the winner will be revealed and get some sweet sweet reddit gold.

Feel free to PM me Fermi problem ideas.

That's 5447 days of illegal drinking. Did this save more lives or cause more deaths? 

According to [Wikipidia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), ""The consumption of alcohol overall went down by half in the 1920s and it remained below pre-Prohibition levels until the 1940s"" which I'm assuming led to less deaths from alcohol poisoning, liver failure, drunk driving, etc. But this also led to the rise in homicides from [6 to 10 per 100,000](http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html) during that period.

G'day everyone!

Every year reddit runs a series of awards for the best posts, comments, subreddits etc (see /r/bestof2011 etc).

This year, things are a little different and awards will be run within each subreddit. That is, **we decide our own awards and we all vote on them.** 

The admins have said that they will provide **5 gold creddits** to distribute between the winners in each subreddit. 

So what awards do we want? To divide up the creddits easily, I think we should have five.

1. **Most thorough estimation**
 - Best assumptions
 - Most accurate calculations
 - Identifies limitations

2. **Greatest contributor**
 - Quantity and quality
 - Comments and posts

3. **Best post**
 - Original
 - Interesting
 - Thought-provoking

4. **ELI5 Award**
 - For the post that is most easily understood
 - A five year old doesn't necessarily need to be able to understand it

5. **Need suggestions!**

One last note. Unless otherwise specified, **the vote count will not be used as a method of determining the best posts/comments.** The vote count is heavily dependent on the number of subscribers, so posts earlier in the year would have an unfair disadvantage. 

We will use this post to coordinate this all, so **post your nominations, suggestions and votes here!** If anyone wants more information, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14cha9/community_best_of_2012_awards/) or post your questions here! 

Cheers!

This question is inspired by [this page](http://www.11points.com/images/bobjonesscience/grandcanyon.jpg) from [a Creationist 'science' textbook](http://www.11points.com/Books/11_Eye-Opening_Highlights_From_a_Creationist_Science_Textbook), previously [posted in /r/atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xmfym/creationism_you_crack_me_up/). Leaving the religious content aside, I'm wondering how much water it would take to carve the entire Grand Canyon in one go, taking not longer than one standard Earth solar year.

1362345701.0	19lh0s	US-sized scale model solar system	weirdguy0101	33	5	4	"[Scale Model Solar Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system_model) are pretty cool. Currently the largest one is in [Sweden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System) with a bigger one under construction in England. 

What if there was a model that spanned the United States?

I decided to use the distance from San Francisco to Washington DC as a base length of 3932km (from Wolfram Alpha). 

Then I took the average AU distance of the planets (ending at Neptune) as a percentage and converted that to km in the SF to DC distance. 

[Here is the spreadsheet I made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkQOo4z8zMZpdEVUNTNJN3djZkNuckVFLTdNNUVFYmc&amp;usp=sharing)

I used Google Earth to [estimate the location of each planet in the US.](http://i.imgur.com/eQiziDW.jpg) 

[Here is the map on Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204171978533958063965.0004d70a91cb5016bc66c&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=38.307181,-102.65625&amp;spn=29.661493,54.228516)

Calculating the ratio of scale km to real km turns out to be 

1 km:1.14x10^6 km

Scaling the planets according to this ratio (also on [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkQOo4z8zMZpdEVUNTNJN3djZkNuckVFLTdNNUVFYmc&amp;usp=sharing)) unfortunately results in a 1,200m diameter sun in SF. The most practical way would probably be to use a different scale for the planets, and use a 1.2m (diameter) sun in SF, and a 4cm mercury. 

Please check my math and geography, I probably made a mistake somewhere.

A way to estimate it would be to look at the sensory inputs that one collects over a life time (visual, auditory, etc). The visual stimuli are probably the most information dense and one can estimate how much storage one would need to record all the visual stimuli over a person's lifetime just by multiplying the current best high definition codec by the average life span of a person. This come to about 500TB per person over 70 years. The other stimuli can be disregarded in an estimation since they probably contain much less information. However, this first estimation is way too coarse, since of all the things we perceive, we only notice and store and remember a very small percentage.

-Three men, two women. All trapped inside the Walmart with no way to get out.

-The individuals want to stay well nourished, not eat just enough to survive.

-Power is lost.

-Trash/waste accumulation isn’t an issue. The survivors have found a way to dispose of trash and their own 
bodily fluids.

-The survivors are not smart enough to figure out that they can cook the fresh or frozen foods using the camping stoves. 

How long will the fresh food last them before it’s all spoiled? How long until the rest of the food with the longer shelf-life is gone?



A harder scenario:
The above assumptions remain the same, except the last one. They are able to cook whatever they can.
The survivors have also found two 55-gallon drums of fuel in the auto section. They can use this to power generators to run whatever they may like (refrigerators, food dehydrators, etc.)

The [Request] tag
-

Do we want to keep it? I don't know if there's much point in tagging the type of post that we get most often, but my original thoughts were to make it easier to distinguish between links to other discussions and requests.

Since then, I used CSS to make requests green but for mobile users or those that disable CSS, this won't help. The titles used to be all very similar, confusing commentors. For example, there were links to other subreddits titled:

&gt; *How fast do you have to throw a burrito so it catches on fire?* 

Perhaps a more appropriate title would be:

&gt; *Aaron Santos estimates that you would have to throw a burrito at 1000 m/s for it to catch on fire.*

Let me know what you think.

Competitions

The vote counts indicate that they're not very popular and I've really had to push promotions to get people involved (reminder posts, sticky bar etc). What do you guys think?

I realise subscriber estimates are pretty boring so I think we'll try a classic guess-the-lollies-in-the-jar next. Anyone else have any ideas?

I was impressed by the accuracy of the results: our median value was *exactly* (to 2 sig figs) what one source I found gave.  I wrote up a summary in the body of that post.

----

**Fermi problem of the week rules:**

The key to making Fermi problems interesting is to *not* go looking up accurate numbers.  They're about making daring estimates and assumptions, and seeing where they take you.  Therefore no outside resources of any kind are allowed, except for [this list of physical constants](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/reviews/rpp2012-rev-phys-constants.pdf) (pdf).  **You only get that list, whatever is in your brain already, and a calculator** (no fancy wolfram alpha shenanigans).

Obviously we can't enforce that rule very easily, so the winner will be determined not by the accuracy of the calculation, but by upvotes.  **Voters are asked to upvote the most elegant Fermi problem logic**, rather than absolute accuracy.  This means you have to **show and explain your work** to demonstrate how clever you are.

Each thread will be in contest mode for 1 week, after which the winner will be revealed and get some **sweet sweet reddit gold**.

Feel free to PM me Fermi problem ideas.

Pretty similar to the [last competition](http://www.reddit.com/r/estimation/comments/zjq0d/meta_how_many_subscribers_will_this_subreddit/) we had, but this time for a subreddit that's a little bigger and more consistent over long periods with the number of subscribers, /r/chemicalreactiongifs. 

As always, here are the traffic stats. 

* [Part 1](http://i.imgur.com/yqm5F.png)

1367272501.0	1dd7xu	How much would it cost to build a fake Jupiter orbiting the earth that looked liked Jupiter was as close to us as the moon is.	yourpenisinmyhand	23	9	25	"Somebody at /r/crazyideas was pondering this question, so I answered it there in a comment and somebody suggested I post the results here. 

How much would it cost to make it look like we were orbiting Jupiter from the same distance the moon orbits the earth:

Well first off we have to figure out what it would look like if we dragged Jupiter as close to us where the nearest point *on its surface* is roughly as far from us as the moon is. I say roughly because the distance to the moon varies between 356,000 km and 406,000 km, so we are going to use 400,000 km because it will mean we have to build a smaller Jupiter since it's at a slightly greater distance and because it's a nice round number. So first off, we want Jupiter's angular or apparent diameter not actual diameter at that distance, which will be different since it's a spherical object. We know the angular radius is going to be Sinx=r/(r+d) d being the distance to the surface of Jupiter (the same as the distance to the moon, or 400,000,000 meters) and r being its actual radius (roughly 70,000,000 meters) so Sinx=(70,000,000/470,000,000). This gives us an angular radius of 8.57 degrees, or an object that appears to be more than 34 times larger than the moon in the sky. 

Now nobody said we had to actually build it at that distance nor did they say we had to actually build it spherically, so we can save a lot of money by just building a flat disc in low earth orbit and paint it or have a projector to make it look like Jupiter. So first off, let's build it about the same distance as the International Space Station because that way we can get SpaceX to deliver our stuff for cheap, and because that's a good Low Earth Orbit height of about 400 km, another nice round number. Since we are building our fake Jupiter much closer, we don't need to build it with the same 70,000 km radius, just the same apparent or angular radius. Turns out our radius only needs to be 60 kilometers (Tan(8.57)=r/400,000) or 120 kilometers across.

Now we need to fly whatever material we are using into space, so we have to save on weight if we can. Let's use the thin aluminum film proposed for uses in space as a solar sail which is only 30 to 100 nanometers thick. With a radius of 60,000 meters and a thickness of about 5 x 10^-8 , we would need only about 1,526 tonnes of aluminum (pi x 60,000^2 x 5 x 10^-8 x 2700 (kilograms per cubic meter of aluminum)) which on todays market, should only cost a bit over $2,855,000. Pretty hefty sum, but that's nothing compared to the cost of getting that into space. 

SpaceX is currently responsible for getting cargo to the ISS and charges about $200,000 per kilo. So given 15,265,000 kilos, that's over **$300,000,000,000** to ship our giant aluminum disc into space.

Edit: Since support structures vary, I didn't take those into account nor did I take into account the actual cost of processing the aluminum into sheets, because whatever, let them sort that out. Plus the original posting actually suggested it be made out of paper. Wikipedia says the typical office paper has a weight of .08 kilos per meter squared. So pi x 60,000^2 x .08 should give us the mass in kilos. Turns out it would weigh 905,000 tonnes (yes I'm doing a lot of rounding), almost 600 times what the aluminum sheet would have weighed and would take almost 181,000,000,000 sheets of paper to cover our fake Jupiter, or 362,000,000 reems. In the United States we use more than 70 times that every year, so we can probably handle the production load. If you buy Dunder Mifflin paper (and why shouldn't you) then you could get the whole thing papered for just under $362 million! Butttt SpaceX is also going to be padding their pockets with over $180 trillion to get it all up there, so hopefully we can get some kind of bulk freighting discount..."	t5_2uh0h	True

Firstly, this is very inexact, so don't take it to be correct. Also, **spoilers** if you haven't seen the movie before. In 1978, Superman failed to save his girlfriend so he flies around the Earth fast enough to turn back time (somehow). The Earth's equatorial circumference is 40,075.017 km and Superman looks to be travelling around double that in a single revolution. Slowing the clip down, I counted the number of trips around the Earth that Superman makes during the 31 seconds shown on screen, and it turned out to be exactly 100. So (100 x 40075.017 x 2) / 31 = 258548.49677419357 km/s. This is around 930,774,588 km/hr or 578,356,516 miles/hr (around 6572233.13284 times faster than Back to the Future's 88 miles per hour)

Like I said, this is inaccurate. I only counted the revolutions shown on screen, because it would be difficult to estimate the revolutions not shown on screen. I also included when he was accelerating and decelerating. I'd be interested if anyone could come up with a better figure, or work out his top speed or distance travelled."	t5_2uh0h	True

I've noticed it takes between 15-20 seconds to dry hands at the hand dryer (for automatic ones), but some have a set time. Also depends how far away the dryer is from the sink (your hands dry a little on the way). Also there are those new crazy dryers that take only 7 seconds. Differences in wattage probably also affect this.


For paper towels, there are variables depending on if it is recycled, how much you need to use based on the sturdiness of the paper, and if you're a wasteful jackass (just kidding). 

I know this seems like a long question with a lot of variables, but I hear arguments about how hand dryers ""save trees""...but I wonder if a model would show that they actually just use up coal/natural gas that is more wasteful/harmful than using recycled paper in the paper towels.

1356752732.0	15lwhf	Converting human power on exercise equipment could replace a 350 Megawatt power plant	FizxTeacher	15	0	2	"An average person can output more than 200 W of power consistently while exercising.  The number from [this article](http://www.bodytransform.co.nz/Blog/Power+output+during+exercise.html) is closer to 250 W.  I'm going to use the 250 W number.

If that power output was harnessed and put back into the power grid, that equates to a major appliance or two.  Or a few 60 W light bulbs.  That's relatively unimpressive. So far.

Most power plants operate on par with hundreds of megawatts (Some are Gigawatts).  One Megawatt = 1,000,000 Watts.  For every 4000 people exercising at an output of 250 Watts, you have 1 MW.

Now comes the tough part - How many people are using exercise equipment (bikes, elliptical, rowing machines, etc.) at any given time?  (I only use exercise equipment since those machines are most easily converted into electrical power.)   Of the more than 7 billion people on earth, could we estimate 1 in 1000 are using exercise equipment at any time?  I think that's too high.  How about 1 in 5000?  It's at least a ballpark figure to start talking about this.

1 in 5000 equate to 1,400,000 exercising at any given time.  At 250 Watts per person, you now have a power output of 350 Megawatts.

To put this into perspective, the largest offshore wind farm is the [Thanet Wind Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanet_Offshore_Wind_Project) in the UK.  It cost between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.  It's maximum output is 300 MW.  That's $4/Watt.  You alone, producing 250 W would be worth $1000."	t5_2uh0h	True

In Gnumeric (free software) you can enter numbers as random numbers that follow certain random distributions, like =randcauchy(2) or =randlognorm(10,2).

These numbers can be used in other formulas.

Each time you recalculate the sheet, you get new numbers - and there is a special functionality to do this automatically, summing up the result of 10000 iterations.


This is documented in: 
http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/doc/sect-advanced-analysis-simulation.shtml


By using this functionality, you not only get estimates for the formulas (average of scenarios), but also various other statistical data for each: standard deviation, max, etc.

So for your project estimates, you should be able to say that in 10% of cases, we will need X resources, in the median case we need Y etc.

Of course there are other and more advanced tools, but it is easy to get started with Gnumeric.

Anthrakia	14	2	3	"I am trying to flip my sleep schedule upside-down, and as such I am consuming a lot of caffeine right now to help me cope with the sleep deprivation. This question came to mind and I decided I wanted to answer it. 

So I looked on my desk and saw one empty can of Coke. Upon examining the nutrition information, I saw that 1 can (350 mL) has 34 mg of caffeine. Scaling this up to 2 litres (at 0.097 g/L) yields **0.194** grams of the tingly goodness our country so dearly loves.

Now, the question of the chocolate is a bit more tricky. I couldn't find a measure of the physical density of dark chocolate, but I thought I could still try to estimate it by its ingredients. According to [Hershey's website](http://web.archive.org/web/20090126124820/http://hersheys.com/nutrition/chocolate.asp), dark (or semisweet) chocolate is made up largely of pure chocolate liquor (not to be confused with chocolate liqueur), which is largely made up of cocoa butter. So if I can assume those substances weigh approximately the same amount by volume, two litres (or 0.002 m^3 of dark chocolate) [would weigh 921.43 kg](http://www.aqua-calc.com/page/density-table/substance/Oil-coma-and-blank-cocoa-blank-butter) X .002 m^3 = 1.843 kg. Since 100 grams of dark chocolate has about 109 milligrams of caffeine ([for Ghiradelli, at least](http://www.energyfiend.com/caffeine-content/dark-chocolate)), two litres of it would have about **180 grams of caffeine**, far more than the mere fifth of a gram in a two litre of Coke.


TL;DR: Dark chocolate has way more caffeine by density than Coca-Cola does.


Now, here's a followup for anyone who would like to pursue it: How much cocaine would it take to get the same buzz that the caffeine in two litres of dark chocolate would give you?

I went through the process of estimation and found that it's actually over 2 billion elephants. I figured y'all would find this interesting:

 - Average density of a neutron star (p) - 5x10^17 kg/m^3
 - Average volume of a thimble (V) - 2.1x10^-5 m^3
 - Average mass of an elephant (m)- 5000 kg/elephant

Plug in a simple conversion equation:

 - pv/m
 - = [(5x10^17 kg/m^3 )(2.1x10^-5 m^3 )]/(5x10^3 kg/elephant)
 - = 2.1x10^9 elephants

Well, even though they movie machine guns fire for much longer, still people outrun machine gun fire.


We've seen the scene: the shooter is standing at a distance, as he pivots a spray of bullets chases a running target, sad little bullets dusting up a wall along the way.


Please help us understand this.  Here are some questions to estimate, and for all of them let's assume the shooter is about 30 feet from the closest point of a flat wall, and the target starts about 15 feet from the point on the wall closest to the shooter and runs parallel to the wall, and unlimited ammo, but normal firing rates for an UZI as those seem frequent in movies:

1. If the shooter rotates to keep pace with the target, what will the spacing between bullets penetrating the wall be like?

2. How slow would a shooter have to rotate to create a pretty solid line of unavoidable bullets?

3. What is the real probability of avoiding getting shot?

4. How fast would the gun have to fire to reduce the avoidance probability to pretty much zero?

1370547921.0	1ft8y1	Approximately how fast are the cars going in the opening chase scene of Quantum of Solace?	666lumberjack	16	6	6	"I'm an amateur writer and I wanted to try to get a feel for the approximate speed involved in a car chase, primarily to get a feel for what kind of exotic vehicles are 'fast enough' for a relatively high-speed chase. Obviously this depends on the location, but I picked [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfYC_CBNtiM) clip because I figure a highway chase is unlikely to be feasible for anything other than vehicles specifically designed for regular road use, mostly cars, trucks and motorbikes. The location here is mostly a twisting quarry road, which is relatively low-speed but still fast enough to be exciting.   

In particular, I'm estimating the speed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfYC_CBNtiM&amp;t=196s) as they pass the front-end loader, as it seems like the best option for getting an idea of both time and distance. The first thing I needed to establish was how long it takes Bond to pick up the gun. I had no idea where to start on this, but based on my own ability to pick up an object of roughly similar mass, I figured it takes him about 1s. It's not entirely clear how much of this he does beforehand, however, so I decided I would go with roughly a second initially. I've scanned through the footage, but I couldn't see any model number on the loader itself, which makes it difficult to know how long it is. However, it seems to be a medium-sized model small enough to use narrow mountain roads but large enough that the chassis section completely obscures the view of the people in both cars. The DBS in the film is about 1.2m tall, so working from that I had a look around on [this website](www.ritchiespecs.com) for an example that seemed to fit. Unfortunately, the vehicles I looked at didn't have the exact dimension I wanted, so I had to guess that I was looking at about 60% of the overall height. Based on that, anything above the smallest models would completely obscure the DBS; however, when I looked at the footage in slow-motion, I was able to get a slightly better estimate of the height. Although perspective made this a little tricky, it seems the 'chassis' is perhaps 120-140% the height of the Alfa Romeo. I'm not sure what model the Alfa is, but based on a few similar ones I pulled up on Wikipedia, I can assume its height at 140cm. 130% of 140cm is 182; dividing that by 0.6 to get a figure for the overall height gave me 303cm.  

I went back to ritchiespecs to find a 3m tall front loader. I found that ~3.3m seemed to be a very common height for mid-range loaders, so all I had to do was find one with an enclosed cab similar to the film and see how long it was. The first few I looked at were all open-cab; it seems to be a common 'feature' on mid-spec loaders. However, the Samsung SL180 does have an enclosed cab and seems very similar to the one in the film. It's approximated 7.8m long, which would suggest a speed of 7.8m/s (~17mph) if the gun was picked up wholly while passing the loader. Since this seems unreasonably slow, I decided my time figure must be wrong; when I had watched the scene in slow-motion, I realised Bond had already gripped the gun and begun lifting it by the time the loader is reached, so I figured it only takes the cars about half a second to pass it, perhaps less. This suggests a speed of around 35-40mph for slower chases, which seems reasonable to me.



New to this sub, I probably made a bunch of stupid assumptions/errors in this calculation, so I'd love to know what you guys think. In particular, it would be awesome if someone with a gun to hand could try for a better estimate of how long he spends lifting it, since I suspect that's the biggest source of error in this. 
EDIT: Just realised the loader itself is already moving at about 20mph in this scene, so I need to revise my estimations upward. Perhaps 1s isn't such a bad figure after all, or perhaps 55-60mph is a more realistic estimate. It's hard to say. "	t5_2uh0h	True

So atoms are the smallest measurable unit of matter.  Earth and the atmosphere, having it's theoretical limits separating the atmosphere from the rest of space, must theoretically contain a *finite* number of atoms.  It might certainly be an incomprehensibly large number, but it would definitely be a finite number.

Then, we essentially create a series of statistical data for each individual atom in the set.  This would include but is not limited to the elemental composition, the speed and direction it is heading, it's relative location on earth, etc.  So a small series of very basic information about each atom.  An important note is that we'd collect the data based on a moment in time, so imagine we paused time and gathered the data that each atom held at that exact moment.

With that data, we create a program that we can input this all into.  The program would manipulate the data in a few ways: Mainly, it'd create a graphical and visual representation of the data (ie. a map of the earth with detail of atomic accuracy).

After that, we'd gather more data into subsets, based on relative changes in time.  We'd compare the subsets against each other and note the trends in physical or chemical reactions and how they occur over time.  From *that* information we can then apply trending models to every atom that dictate it's future conditions and state.

Through creating enough trending models and gathering/analysing enough of the information, we could eventually have a working model of the earth, with which one could examine the state of the earth in *any time period, past, present, or future*.  We could eventually move the information coverage to the entire universe, and the information would stretch from the very beginning and end of it's existence.

There are a few estimations to this:

**1. How many atoms comprise our earth and atmosphere?**

**2. Given the most complete model of the program would include the entire universe, encompassing every moment of time that universe has or will ever exist in, how much disk space would be required to hold that information?**"	t5_2uh0h	True

My thinking is that things wouldn't be gravity-less for terribly long, because the jet would reach terminal velocity pretty quickly.

Well, I took [this competition](http://www.reddit.com/r/estimation/comments/10xlw2/competition_2_estimate_the_number_of_subscribers/) a little more seriously than the [first one](http://www.reddit.com/r/estimation/comments/zjq0d/meta_how_many_subscribers_will_this_subreddit/) and did up a spreadsheet to keep track of the subscriber counts, as /u/Rob_C has been doing. 

[My model](http://i.imgur.com/N2ClY.png) actually did a really good job of predicting the results, with a predicted outcome of 14,671 -- only 47 subscribers off which is about half an average day. Unfortunately, when I made my estimate, I plugged the wrong number into the equation resulting in a prediction for mid-November and my estimate doesn't count anyway because I'm the judge. 

**However, the winner, with a guess of 14,700 subscribers, only 18 off the final answer is /u/Bulwersator!** I'm about to send him a message now to ask him what he wants his flair to be.

Thanks for all that entered, and keep your eyes out for the next competition. Maybe something a little different? A classic guess-the-number-of-lollies-in-the-jar maybe?

Well, we're two months in and we've got 1,549 readers so let's have a competition. I'll give flair to the two people that make the **closest estimate to the number of subscribers on the 30th September**, Australian time.

In the interest of fairness, you've got a week to make your guess, so **entries close when this post is a week old** (roughly 5pm AEST, GMT+10)

And of course I won't leave you in the dark, so here's the traffic stats:

- [Part 1](http://i.imgur.com/FNFgO.png)

- [Part 2](http://i.imgur.com/EzRbO.png)

The three massive spikes are (from top to bottom), promoting the subreddit on /r/newreddits, /r/xkcd, and when we got SRoTD. 

We're currently on the sidebar of /r/metric, /r/hypotheticalsituation and /r/xkcd. 

Good luck! My guess is 3,000.

Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1h8p99/what_if_every_single_spider_in_the_world_was_just/) post, I'm on a mission to estimate the world's spider population. I'm finding the amount of available information on the subject extremely lacking.

Obviously, one would expect to be this number to vary quite a bit between forests, meadows, urban areas, etc. A global mean surface density would be nice, but I'll settle for any reputable estimate for any climate/terrain type.

After an hour or so of intense Googling, I've found several claims of 131 Spiders / m^2 with vague references to a ""study out of England and Holland a few years ago"" and no actual citations to be found anywhere. I'm 99% certain this is a case of [citogenesis](http://xkcd.com/978/).

A few Missouri government websites make claims of 30,000 to 2,500,000 per acre, but again, with no citations. I'm pretty suspect of these numbers as well.

I found [one paper](http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v18_n2/JoA_v18_p181.pdf) with some numbers given per unit area of tree foliage in East-Central Maine, but that's pretty much the best information I've been able to find on the subject.

1370381568.0	1fog4p	"The Amount of Data in a Digital ""Ark"" of Earth's Life"	wheremydirigiblesat	6	1	3	"So suppose you want to take a representative sample of the biodiversity of Earth with you on a starship to, say, terraform a new world. How much data is that?

**Assumptions:**

* I've read that an entire genome sequence for 1 human is about 1.5GB. I'm assuming that some species have much more and others much less, but that this gets us in the ballpark.

* We want 10,000 breeding pairs (20,000 genomes) per species.

* Only about 3% of our DNA separates humans from chimpanzees, so I assume that a similar rate of differentiation occurs across other species. We can use this to package the data in a more compact fashion. For example, we only have to save 3% of the 1.5GB of each of the 20,000 human genomes and have just one or a handful of full human genome ""master copies"". Let's say 10.

* There are other cell biological differences besides just DNA, of course. The cell machinery itself is fairly different in a mammal than in a bacteria, and DNA doesn't tell us all the details of the ""starting state"" of the cell machinery that our mothers gave us. There might even be slight yet important differences in the mitochondria between humans and other apes for all I know. However, I assume that, if we can fit something as informationally-rich as an entire human genome into 1.5 GB, then this extra data is another small addition. Let's say equivalent to 10 individual genomes of data for each species.

* 8.7 million species on Earth


**The Calculation:**

So we have the data equivalent of about 20,020 human genomes per species, which is about 30,030GB or 30.03TB. Multiply this by the number of species and we get 261.3 million TB. 

Can we realistically fit this much data on a near-future starship? If we reasonably assume that 100TB hard drives (with dimensions like 1""x4""x5"") will be feasible by that time, then this cache of hard drives would take up about the space of a house, so it seems within the realm of possibility.

Immigration accounts for almost all of Canadian population increase in modern times, so I’m curious as to what the effect would be if this factor was taken away earlier in our history.

I tried to think about this myself, but I’m not sure how a natural growth rate is supposed to be decided here; are there certain factors specific to a population that must be taken into account when deciding on natural growth rates over time? Because the natural growth rate differs over time based on numerous influences, is it even possible for a reliable estimation to be made for this hypothetical situation?

Like attracts like, opposites repel each other. Now imagine that the Earth and the star Antares (without its companion) are gravitationally attracted to each other, the Earth orbiting it. A normal, healthy gravitational relationship. Now imagine a concrete (like the material), 1 km radius sphere with the opposing gravitational charge. Imagine it held to Earth by a chain, 200 meters in length. It faces the Antares. Now, say, on that sphere, likewise facing Antares, there's a tiny, raised, concrete bunker. Inside that concrete bunker, there is a penguin. Or a small mammal. Or a human. Whatever. Now. The distance that Earth has to float from Antares to maintain a chilly but habitable atmosphere can be expressed as a function of the amount of energy that photons carry. This relationship, by itself, is malleable, and not relevant or interesting. However. I cut the chain that holds the sphere to the surface of Earth, and let it shoot off to Antares, beginning with an acceleration of nearly ten meters per second per second. I need you to do the following:

I need to be able to think of a duration of time that it will take for this sphere to get close enough to Antares (which repels the sphere, gravitationally) so that the penguin or mammal or human or whatever gets baked alive, and be able to figure out the distance the Earth has to be from Antares for it to take that long, and the strength and proportionality to distance (proportional to distance squared? proportional to distance to the 5/2 power? proportional to distance to the 4/3 power?) that the electromagnetic force has to have to reconcile that time and the fact that the Earth is in Antares' habitable zone. So, essentially three functions of time.

That is, of course, really difficult, and I'll reward anyone who answers it in any way I can. I'm not especially talented in any way, so you can't really commission a drawing or a program or music, but the very least I can do is grant you attention, in the form of /r/bestof and /r/homestuck (the latter of which I will be posting what I am using this for to).

&gt; On the other hand, suggesting that the humanoid form is somewhat efficient and gets re-discovered by nature doesn't seem so unlikely. In a story in which intelligent life is plentiful in the galaxy, I wouldn't be surprised if some sort of convergent evolutionary process doesn't lead to a roughly humanoid dominant species at least a few times.

I'm not sure if the human bipedal form would be dominant, but still I feel there's something here.

So, for our galaxy, what would be a ratio between all locations where life could emerge and distinguishable basic types of creature? There's only a limited amount of combinations of basic metabolism systems, types/bands of environments, workable symmetry axis, ways to move actuators, locomotion or rig sensoring methods etc. And space is very big, so many planets. But how do they relate?

I understand this will be extremely rough but I'm hoping on insight whether we'd see strong recurring themes or everything is pretty much very unique. Let's assume the working period the whole age of our galaxy up until now and use our current understanding of it's size and basic physics. We could limit it to just 'standard' planets and moons (no sun fieldliners or nebular beings). A human distinguishable type would mean a group in some scheme similar to Earth's biologal classification.

Every cent of this can, in theory, be traced back to either a worker getting a paycheck or an investor getting dividends.

So while the bread manufacturer gets a chunk of money, part of that goes to the floor workers, part of that goes to management, part of that goes to the person who maintains the machines, part of that goes to buying grain . . .

. . . except that's not an endpoint either, so ""buying grain"" really goes to a shipping company (and from there to the truck driver, etc), and to the farm (and from there to the farmer themself, plus farm equipment manufacturers, water sales, etc) . . .

And once everything is said and done, and we can point to the loaf of bread and say ""0.003% of the cost of this bread went to the highly-paid person who designed the oil refinery that refined the oil that was used by the shipping company to move the grain that was baked into bread, and 0.00008% was spent on the minimum-wage gas station attendant for the station the truck stopped at"", how much of the cost of the bread was spent on people earning minimum wage?

Admittedly its a slippery concept and difficult to quantify, so I guess we'll see what /r/estimation can come up with this time.  Here goes!

Imagine a precipice with a void beneath.  Shuffling towards the precipice are people... a *lot* of people (and its this number we're estimating).  At the edge, the vast majority of them topple over into the void like lemmings, never to be seen again.  So far, only two of them have ever been saved... these two special people were plucked away at just the right moment by the only two people who could do it - me and their mother.

The mass of people are my potential children.  The two saved are my actual children.  If I'd never met their mother, or it had been any other time, they too would have gone over the precipice.

So my question is, how many people are shuffling over the precipice into the void right now at this every moment.  9 months ago there were 7 billion people on the planet, half were women, some percentage of those were able to have children with me... but none of them did.  And as a consequence all the possible children I could have had will now disappear over the edge into the void... total reality failure!

* The zombies have a bit less use of their muscles, so they're not quite as strong or fast. However, they don't feel pain, so may push their bodies past the normal limits that a human might stop (for instance, they would keep trying to bite even to the point of breaking their own jaw). They also lack any fine motor skills, and while shots to certain parts of the body may remove or impair use of that part of the body, the only way to fully destroy them is by destroying the brain.

* The soldiers are trained military personnel, perhaps some Army branch equipped with M16s, M249s...perhaps they would have vehicles and mounted weaponry available.

* If it matters, it's midday, the temperature is fair, the sun is out but it's not too hot or humid.

* Reinforcements aren't coming. Outside assistance and contact are unavailable.

* Zombies become visible once they exit the forest which is ~250m away from the nearest stationed soldier. If the soldiers in the base are all facing to the north, then the forest line runs east-west and zombies come out of the forest headed south, headed straight for the base.
