And of course try to ask your questions here!



* Does this game work for Mac users?


This game is not currently supporting Mac osx. However there are two fixes available.

[An app which launches the game for you courtesy of Kibook.](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/topic/174-mac-os-x-app/)



[And an .exe patch from reddit user mtwede.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/z6sy3/amazing_a_pokemon_mmo_that_actually_works_and_you/c6282rn)



* How do I get my Pokemon to follow me? 
 

You need to place a pokemon soul silver or Heart gold .NDS file into your roms folder. **Then drag the pokemon from your party list to the ground next to you.**

* How can I make my game look better?


By installing the updated textures so generously provided by Darkshade.
Found [here.](http://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/topic/786-firered-with-updated-graphics/)
*(Side note: By having the Soul silver or Heart gold roms


* What works and what doesn't?


Currently, ect.)

Pokemon battle, 1V1 Duels, Trainer battle, EV's, and many moves are included.



* Do the battle mechanics follow later Gens



All battle Mechanics are of Gen III



* Do trade evolutions work?


Yes


* How do I Trade/Duel/Friend someone?


Right click them.



* Is this game the same as Pokemon Fire Red?


Pokemon MMO follows the same basic plot as Fire Red. All locations, and items are the same. 



Pokemon include the exclusives from both versions.  For example, though Sanshrew is also included.


* How do I access my Friend list?


Type /friendlist Into chat.


* How do I make the chat stay solid all the time?

Click the small lock icon


* Where is POKEMON/ITEM/EVENT?


Have a look through [this](http://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml)



* What about legendaries


You **cannot** find **legends** in the wild


**Shiny Pokemon are included** and are encountered as normal

Beware of those scammers and look for suspicious behavior for example if they act  like they dont have a lot of time and need to get the trade over quickly.

For now you can't report these scammers but you can inform others in the Trade chat of the Names of these Scammers.

Reddit is one of my favorite communities overall. Especially for PokeMMO.

Used to, etc. and share my thoughts. However, that's just not possible on the forums for PokeMMO.

Being completely blunt
It's really sad to see a community that could be a lot of fun to be involved in be full of literally just assholes. I even received a bit of unnecessary hostility from moderators. Granted

I have an idea for how to make the end game more fun, I was thinking about how everyone really wants to become a gym leader in the hand helds.  It's like a long standing dream, and really, with some hard work and creativity we can totally do that in PokeMMO.

All it takes is this:

* Try to get your name out about being a leader by telling people who/where you are when you log in.

* Always battle in the same place so that people know where to look for you.

* Pick a theme!  Make a cool one.  It doesn't even have to be all dragon or all fire.  I was thinking of an all Eevee evolution team for me.  But you can do something like an all starter line up.  Maybe even copy the pokemon other NPC gyms have

* BREED!  Here's the it gets tricky and kind sorts out who really wants to be a leader and who doesn't.  Well, since we can't give out badges I was thinking we would give out Pokemon.  Naturally not your main team line up, but a good Pokemon that embodies the theme you chose for yourself.  If I did Eevee evolutions, obviously people who beat me would get an Eevee.  All starters?  Let the winner choose a starter.  Dragons?  Dratini or something.  Be creative about it!  And since other people can't name the Pokemon think of a unique name for them.  Not ShitFace or TurdGoblin or anything, just something to show that it's a legit Gym Pokemon.

* Be okay with losing!  People are SUPPOSED to beat gym leaders!  That's the point of Pokemon.  Don't throw the fight

* Battle for your spot.  If you and someone else decide they both want to be the Ice Gym leader

* And last idea

* Actually

Who knows

Anyway, people could already be doing this, I haven't checked.

One thing I have seen that is a semi popular sentiment among casual players like me is that ""PokeMMO is the kinda game where you only play it once after an update to catch all the new pokemon and then never play it again until the next update"" I suppose people that love to do 50s battles will continue to play to get that perfectly ev trained correct natured starmie or what not

So what else would motivate someone to play the game? One thing I think would be lots of fun is to take the concept of secret bases in RSE or the underground from DP would be lots of fun! Setting up traps for others and hanging out in the underground would be very fun I'd think. Would adding in non cannonical pokemon things be interesting such as a pokemon ""raid"" where each person can only bring in one pokemon and together the six of you form a ""party.""

Anyway

* Kadabra
* Butterfree - it seems to overlap a bit with Kadabra having good cc and psychic damage; So I'm thinking I should get rid of one of those two at least?
* Warturtle
* Pikachu - Loving the paralyze (whatever it's called)
* Pidgeotto  - He doesn't really see much use
* Beedrill - Same as Pidgeotto pretty much

I know it's probably pretty bad

Yet another one...  




So why is this not open source? Why are pretty much none of the Pokemon MMO open source?  
All Pokemon MMO have suffered greatly from at least one of the following
- Unpleasant staff  
- Unpleasant community  
- Slow development  
  
  
Examples :  
- Pokemon Cyrus Online - When I played it back in 2009, their youngest one, 15, being the most mature of them). It was its greatest problem. The lead developer (Cyrus) was simply really self-important and arrogant. The server was very badly managed and they rolled out changes that included glitches that would allow people to gain advantage and would destroy the ""economy"". That's not to say that the server was starting to get overrun by toxic Brazilians at the time. There was some kind of petty bashing and competition against other Pokemon MMOs going on as to who would get the best Pokemon MMO.  
- Pokemon World Online - I heard (heard. I haven't actually played
- Pokemon Online (POL) - It has been in development forever and it doesn't seem like it's going to see the light of the day anytime soon. They want to get it right the first time
- PokeMMO - Development is also slow.  
- Pokémon : Den of Ages - Had very friendly staff and great custom maps back when I played it in 2009
  
  
What I don't understand is that nobody is able to come together and create a basic Pokemon MMO, fork, mod and run however they want afterwards. I know that it is very feasible, so I really don't understand why it's not happening. We're not talking about developing a new game concept and new game mechanics, everything is already there. We already know how pretty much everything should work vanilla.  
  
  
I have some programming knowledge in java, making a tabbed chat system or at least making it so the channel can be selected from a drop down menu instead of successively clicking a button. But I can't, because for them to let me access the source, I'd probably have to prove them that my skills are worthwhile first (which they are not, they are obviously more experienced than I). It would be much more simple if anyone could submit anything for a commit, without engagement. Job would get done much more quickly and 10 different groups of people wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel 20 times.  
  
  
Consider Minecraft and the Bukkit API
  
  
To quote a friend
  
  
To apply this to a Pokemon MMO would mean that players could make custom maps

.
.

It seems that competitive battling (a la Smogon) is pretty much separate from playing through the story. This makes the first ~50 hours of gameplay largely a grindfest to acquire lvl. 100

Nuzlocking is great fun for veterans who have already played through once.

There is no reward for PvP battles while you are progressing through the story -- I'm the only person I know who battles strangers.

Finding good matchups is a pain -- I can't tell when people are way higher level than I am.

.
.

Thoughts of a 'competitive' scene mid-story: (take with a grain of salt

.
.


Nuzlocke makes it very difficult to catch and keep desired pokemon for your team -- Abra is rare

Movesets are very limited early game -- TMs available at Celadon include Attract, good power and wide availability

Entire sides of the metagame are unavailable, weather, Endeavor/Flail + Focus sash variants, Hidden Power, Toxic.

Dig and Fly

Paraflinching and variations are easy since Bite is common; notably Zubat with confuse ray/attract

Sleep Powder Butterfree is possibly OP pre-30; it has excellent stats at low levels and has access to Compoundeyes boosted Sleep powder/Stun spore/Supersonic. Can hit hard with confusion/psychic or STAB aerial ace. It can OHKO Vital spirit Mankey but can be checked by an early Golem.

Similarly early Beedrill is a fearsome sweeper with STAB twineedle

Trade-evolutions have better stats than most at the same level; Alakazam is most common but Gengar/Machamp/Golem can still pose a threat.

Playing Nuzlocke forces a tankier build, Selfdestruct Koffing/Voltorb).

PokeFlute and Yellow flute both offer 1-turn sleep/confusion cures mid-game. May not be useful without a speed advantage.

Other good choices are Gyarados from the Magikarp salesman and early Alakazam from trading. Dragon Rage/Secret Power are excellent early

Low PP moves are an annoyance in story

It's often worth it to delay evolution for earlier moves.

Trading pre-Misty can be dangerous as pokemon may be unruly.

A severe lack of fire types and ground moves makes bulky Ivysaur (Leech seed/Poisonpowder/Sleep Powder) difficult to deal with; Gyarados/Beedrill can kill at the risk of Sleep Powder

Few sure-hit moves make double team/minimize worth bannin. A last resort is Swift Sandshrew which hard counters Pikachu but might have trouble with Clefable

Snorlax, minus Squirtle); Umbreon is tanky and STAB Bite/Faint attack can hit Alakazam and Gengar.

Trading for Dratini/Beldum/Bagon/Larvitar is expensive and hence rare. No early ice

Grinding at game corner for BoltBeam
Many of these issues can be solved with bans; but bans may be unfeasible for 'casual' amateur battlers who are just looking for a challenge while they beat story.
