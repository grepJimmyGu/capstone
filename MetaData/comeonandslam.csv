As you may or may not know, uploading a few of my own ideas, etc.  I now give you the end result of all of this work -- a 60 minute mixtape of my personal favorites that I made, plus a few surprise tracks.  All of the songs blend together seamlessly and I also incorporated relevant audio from several sources (mostly YouTube).  It's pretty much as Barkley as I could make it.

Feel free to stream the tunes off of the Bandcamp page I have linked to above

**SUBMISSION GUIDELINES**

&gt;Quality: Slams should be audible, but not always, as in the case of early Slam Jams.

&gt;Diversity: Yes, but we want slams from music, tv, video games and movies too.

&gt;Influence: A few well-known slams should be on this list

*Don't be shy with submissions! The more we have to choose from and discuss as a community

1348452134.0,10ddw6,[TUTORIAL] High-Quality Slam Jams in FLStudio (song DL),Robot7290,52,10,4,"Hello

**[STEP 1] DOWNLOAD SPACE JAM**

Click below to download my master. This file is a 192kbps copy of Quad City DJ's - Space Jam with some denoising and cleanup done on the track. If you've heard slams where the male lead sounds grainy and distant, free. Take it, share it, do as you please. You don't even need to credit me. Just don't claim you made it yourself, and I'll be fine. Enjoy! (BIG FILESIZE WARNING)

http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?593cdqao2blz827

**[STEP 2] PLAN YOUR SLAM**

""Space Jam goes with everything, look for a song with a steady tempo that doesn't change. Electronic, hip-hop, video game, and pop all work very well. Rock, some jazz, and others are a little harder. Also, but you generally don't want two people singing at once.

**[STEP 3] DOWNLOAD A SONG**

Download the song you want to slam. Try to find something above 192kbps

**[STEP 4] DRAGGING INTO FLSTUDIO**

Open your Playlist view and drag both songs in. You'll see vertical, and this is one of the most important steps of the process.

**[STEP 5] TEMPO: TO-BE-SLAMMED SONG**

Run a Detect Tempo on the to-be-slammed song (click the little arrow in the top left of the waveform), and match the project to that.

**[STEP 6] TEMPO: SPACE JAM**

Now that the to-be-slammed song is properly matched to those bars, but rarely. Again, all up to ear. At this point, do a listen test to see if your tempos are matching up.

**[STEP 7] FUTHER SYNCING**

Sound good? Not yet. Now, and stare at the start of both songs (the waveform, that is). Your job now is to determine the start of each song. And it's NOT the start of the file in most cases.

Usually, but most programs Slice along these bars, so you want to make sure your placement is PERFECT.

If you can't move the playlists in small increments, 'snap' to the vertical bars. This is important later). The Snap button is located atop the Playlist besides the other tools.

Back to syncing your songs

**[STEP 8] FURTHER TWEAKING**

*groan* Yeah, louder, cleaner, and generally more pleasing to hear. In FLStud, open the Mixer. Highlight (select) the song channel that should have been added to your Pattern window when you entered them in your Playlist at the beginning. Then, click to highlight one of the columns over in your empty mixer. Hit CTRL-L to move it into the mixer. Repeat this step for both of your songs.

Now, and now select Parametric EQ 2. Another window will appear. Keep these two together. This is your metaphorical 'control panel' for this song. Do this to both songs, meaning four windows separated into two pairs.

**[STEP 8.A] LIMITER (COMPRESSION)**

Right now, including a straight line above a circle. Click both of these icons, then click the COMP (Compressor) button. Increase your Threshold until the corresponding blue line lies somewhere about the halfway point of the height of your waveform. Then, increase the Ratio to anywhere in the following range (meaning tweak until you find what's best):

Space Jam: 1.8-2.0

Overly loud or vocal heavy songs: 1.9-2.0

Soft vocals

**[STEP 8.B] EQUALIZER**

Equalization is where we further reduce some frequencies of one song to allow room for the important parts of another, on the other song (as in, not Space Jam), you want to drag the 6 button down until you feel comfortable. Generally, drag it down 1/3 of the distance to the bottom of the graph, but this is all up to your ear and the balance you've chosen to this point.

That's generally all we need from the other song. Now, everything is up to a listen test.

**[STEP 9] SLICING

Now it's time to Slice. This is where your choice of composition comes in play. If you followed this tutorial correctly, slice it up between verses (on the corresponding vertical lines WITH Snap), and just have fun with it! Listen and listen and listen, find what sounds best.

You might not be able to slice everywhere without catching the end of a word from the last track, because we're following the tempo of the beat (drums), not the vocals, which artistically will stray in their waveform from your neat slices.

How do you fix it? If you're using FLStudio, and drag until you've got something that sounds neat. Feel free to overlap, and if you need to fill in a gap of audio left by this process, steal some of the non-vocal beat from the beginning and use it to patch in a gap. If you've followed up to this point, this shouldn't be too difficult. Remember the visual analogy of blocks.

**[STEP 10] FADE-IN/FADE-OUT**

In FLStudio, ending in two dots on either side. This is your volume line, so you can create fade-outs or fade-ins wherever you please. Remember, if you fade-out in the middle of a track, you have to fade-in again before the volume will increase.

**[WRAP-UP] FINALIZING YOUR SONG**

Go make a sandwich, listen to other music, and come back to it with a clear head. Then tweak, tweak, tweak, polish, polish, having heard it so long

Before you save, triple-check everything. Plug in headphones, take out headphones. Listen to it both ways, and see if you can add further polish. Remember, always save with a high-quality bitrate, generally 192kbps+

Details in post description.,drofnasleinad,31,8,9,"So as you may know, but there is only one problem: I am a dude so I can't properly sing the female vocals on the chorus.  I figured that I should return to the source by asking r/comeonandslam if they know any female singers who would be willing to collaborate with me.  You don't have to be a professional singer or anything

Some specifications:

1. Don't be a dude running your vocals through a ""voice changer.""  Those things are a joke and if they actually worked

2. Please record your vocals on a decent quality vocal microphone.  No computer mics, they only cost about $50 for passable ones. 

3. Please save all files as 44100 mono .wav files in 16-bit resolution. If you don't know what this means

4. Don't breathe into the microphone when singing.  Digitally removing breath and wind sounds is extremely difficult.

5. Don't apply any effects to your voice. I want the dry audio and I will apply all necessary effects afterward. Definitely don't use autotune -- if you need autotune

I only need 1 singer for this but I will accept submissions from multiple people and then choose the one I think is the best.  I'd like to have the whole mashup album done by the end of April so let's get cracking on this sooner rather than later.  Oh yeah

BTW

1) Sound quality of your tracks. Try to find the tracks with the best quality before you begin mashing up. In the long run, higher quality files will react better to time stretching (less artifacts).

2) Use reverbs! These things are the holy grail of blending (or ""gluing"") your tracks together. Just make sure to filter out the low end a bit

3) Use EQ to bring out the vocals of the Quad City Djs track

4) Experiment and have fun. Try using delays, panning, and other effects to bring the mix alive. Keeping the listener interested in these slams can be challenging, especially when we've all heard the same song hundreds of times. Use whatever you can to make the song enjoyable, even for the slam connoisseur.

5) Take plenty of time syncing your tracks up to each other. This process is usually very tedious

6) Parallel compression. Slightly advanced (and may not even be needed)

Feel free to add any other tips that could help out our fellow slammers!

If you'd like to listen to my current slams or subscribe for freshly-updated slams
www.youtube.com/robot7290


**Applejack is Slamming On Her Own (Quad City DJs vs. SoGreatAndPowerful)**

This one's a lot of fun, but she's been a tough cookie. I have to say though, this one's slamming along nicely. Although don't expect it for a while. I'm not releasing this girl until she's good and ready.

**Untitled Kotake &amp; Koume Theme Slam (Quad City DJs vs. Koji Kondo)**

Oh, but it stays true to the original track. This is almost finished and will be dropping soon.

**Untitled Onward from VVVVVV Slam (Quad City DJs vs. SoulEye)**

This one's been a lot of fun; anything from SoulEye is. Maybe it's because the music is electronic and more... mathematical in nature, well-assembled slam. This one might be coming around soon too.

**Guile's Slam Goes With Every Jam (Quad City DJs vs. Yoko Shimomura)**

My turn to take a crack at it. What can I say? It's Guile's Theme. You know what it sounds like. You know what it sounds like with QCD layered over it. But you've never heard it edited as precisely as this. This one's a lot of fun to work with as well

**Slam of Laura (Quad City DJs vs. Akira Yamaoka)**

Oh god, especially with something as feisty as Space Jam. That male vocal tends to drown out a lot of the guitar and even the piano at softer moments, so I'm going to do what I did with Sundered Slam and treat the guitar as a vocal, and just lay a background beat over it. This slam is about halfway done but like any Yamaoka slam, it's going to take a while just for sheer delicacy of the source material.

**Untitled Splash Woman's Stage Theme from Mega Man 9 (Quad City DJs vs. Ippo Yamada)**

I'm redoing one of my first slams, but it's nothing epic. But if you love 8-bit... Unf. Give this a listen when it eventually drops. I haven't invested a lot of time into this, but what I have done is promising, and finishing it won't take too long.

**I'll Make A Slam Out Of You

Hard. Hard hard hard. Impossible? Maybe. I'm beginning to think so. This slam is driving me crazy. More than Cara Mia Ballino. If I pull this off

**Prince Barklii! (Quad City DJs vs. Donald Griffin)**

The marketplace music from Alladin on the Genesis. This one is really, but I think I can do it. The entire song is really upbeat and works SO WELL with Space Jam it's not even funny. Although I can't help but giggle at the word Barklii.",,False,self,t5_2sv9h,False,,

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

What up

I had a crazy idea today and now I'm considering pressing physical copies of my albums [It's Time To Slam Jam](http://r0cketsauce.bandcamp.com/album/its-time-to-slam-jam) and [It's Time To Slam Jam Vol. 2: Slam Nights](http://r0cketsauce.bandcamp.com/album/its-time-to-slam-jam-vol-2-slam-nights).  Would there be any interest in buying these things?  Let's get into specifics:

* This would most likely be a super limited run of about 100 copies per album (200 discs total) pressed through a local Austin album pressing company
* Each disc would come in a full color digipak with a ""black on silver"" design for the disc itself (black on silver is cheaper to make
* I'd mail copies directly to anyone who is interested
* I probably could sell them at $5 a piece and break even on this project
* If there's enough interest

What I need from you:

* Would you be willing to buy it?
* How much would you think is a fair amount for me to ask people to pay?
* Do you think pressing both volumes is a waste of time or should I just focus on Vol 1 or Vol 2?
* Is this idea completely bat shit crazy and totally not worth pursuing because
* Any additional thoughts or comments you might have (feel free to tell me I suck and should stop making mashup albums)

This post will sorta serve as an unofficial pre-order page

**Overtime:** I'm also nearly finished with a non-Space Jam mashup album that is tentatively being titled ""Ultradance Party Megamix 2000"".  It will be my homage to ""techno"" and the mix CDs that were all the rage back before the year 2000.  I'll post it on my Bandcamp page whenever it is done and it's basically going to be pretty heavy on 90s dance tracks, thanks in advance!",,False,self,t5_2sv9h,1376060527.0,,
