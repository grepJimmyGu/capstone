1321543713.0,mfqjg,A subreddit devoted to pugs? My moment has come.,pugsplosion,49,4,9,"I have a lot of experience with pugs. Let me tell you about them.


[This is Pumpkin](http://i.imgur.com/mkTvI.jpg), she was adorable, we couldn't say no to her. [This is her when she was little](http://i.imgur.com/TIOJy.jpg). 


[Here's an album of Pumpkin being awesome](http://imgur.com/a/rQfF8).  Included are pumpkin's first birthday


We loved Pumpkin


Cole had some serious medical issues, not to mention [sexy as all hell](http://i.imgur.com/CEfcu.jpg).  But [Pumpkin loved him](http://i.imgur.com/WzO3m.jpg) and we loved having him.


After that


Then came Ripley


Seeing how well Pumpkin did with other dogs, they became best friends. They are now inseparable. 


Now the sad bit.  Our next foster was an emergency rescue.  A family decided to buy dogs on craigslist and found a pair of pugs that looked cute.  The seller met them at night in a parking lot.  After getting the money

Carly came extremely thin, and eye infections, overgrown nails and absolutely no socialization with humans or other dogs.  The vet told us she'd probably had five or six litters before she became too sick to breed.  [We slowly nursed her back to life](http://imgur.com/a/pGejP) and with Pumpkin and Boris's help, she became a happy healthy pug who's now living in New York.


With all the awesomeness going on at our place, [her and Pumpkin](http://i.imgur.com/EC4Fe.jpg) hit it off right away. Henry was found abandoned in backyard on the brink of death. Don't worry though, we [fattened him up again](http://i.imgur.com/eAXLA.jpg). [Together](http://i.imgur.com/7Hrsf.jpg), the four of them are almost to much Pug cute to handle.


That's all of them

And I think I'll post a regular link of a pic
