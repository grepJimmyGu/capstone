Doing commissions for cheap, $10-$40.",jarwastudios,79,34, but things got ugly and my wife and I had to return the Christmas gifts we bought for everyone just to make our bills. The upcoming month doesn't look like it's going to be any easier

So, go to jarettwalen.com and there's tons there. I'll do simple pencil drawings for $10, more complex goes up, it's really going to be dependent on the subject, but I'm charging beans so you can have some art, and I can have some money. I can do full color too, but that does take a bunch of time and will cost more.

This is awesome.

What's not awesome about it is the prices discussed. Every time

What. The. Fuck. Is. *Wrong*. with you people? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Are we so conditioned to accept the ""starving artist"" role that we not only are ready and willing to accept an insulting price for a piece but we're *happy* to accept it?

And you people offering less than 3 digits for a painting.... what the hell are you thinking? Paints, etc are expensive. Not only that but if it were easy, you'd be painting it yourself and you're happy to insult an artist for all the time, love, and frustration they've put into learning their trade? 

I'm a still an art student and I would never neither accept nor offer anything less that $100 for any piece even if it were 3 inches square. I have pieces hanging on my wall right now that are 40 inches on the short side that people keep wanting to buy. Every time someone new comes over

Why do I set such high prices and why am I ranting now?

Pride. 

Be proud of what you can do. Don't let someone tell you that it's worth less than it is. If you're offering what you think is a reasonable price

I spent almost 40 years of my life desperately wishing I could do what I do now. And now that I can

My 91 year old grandfather has recently has [re]started a hobby that he had once left behind years and years ago.

He was a engineer for his entire career and used his mathematical and planning skills to turn into art. He makes these AMAZING wire arts and ink arts. 

The ink art are drawn onto a thick 4-ply foam board (""mat board"") with a white ink. He is also starting to do white boards with blank ink.

The wire art are wound tightly through a plank of wood that has been drilled, and stainless steel wires (depending on the color/shade needed)

Please check them out and enjoy. We are going to be establishing him an Etsy store soon

One thing I saw recently was [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/artstore/comments/g12zw/untitled_original_painting_16x12in_ink_on_wood/)- where the individual piece of art was displayed and a recommended price given. I think that's a valid way to do this. Maybe we're going about it all wrong linking to gallaries and etsy shops. Maybe we need to use this subreddit to list individual pieces of art and the price in the title. Something like this format:

&gt; ""Piece name"" artist/medium/size/price+shipping

so for example:

&gt; **""The Sistine Chapel"" by Michaelangelo,000 square feet, asking $99,000,000,000 OBO + $35,000

The website is [canvasmatch](http://canvasmatch.com) Thanks in advance.

1368245684.0,1e42p9,Traditional Illustrator/Artist - Struggling to pay rent therefore commissions are open! (x-post from r/forhire),ThatAwkwardGinger,13,4,0,"Hello
  
Here is a little bit about myself to get things started.  
  
Come September
  
Aside from my history of art commissions there is my issue with rent and the constant struggles of trying to find a job. Currently I'm two months late and owe $1000; once I pay this off I will have given all my rent money and be free of all financial stress (for now). Now, I'm open to doing a larger abundance of work for much cheaper than usual! After completing my first year of college (a portfolio building program) and learning new skills as well as improving what I already know my work ethic also improved greatly (in other words, I'm confident I can take on a large workload and am very excited to do so!).  
  
Now, or any other inquiries you have. You don't have to limit yourself to what is listed below. If you have special requests, don't be afraid to ask! (I'm always interested in creating new and exciting things.)

  I also must emphasize that all commissions will be digitally scanned unless specifically requested to be mailed out unlike the examples given here (which will cost more due to shipping but that can be discussed in private). I had to take pictures of these examples because I was temporarily without a scanner at the time but that problem is now solved.   
  
I hope I've peaked someone's interest and as always thank you sooo much for checking out my work (even if you're not interested in purchasing anything, publicity, and anything else you can think of is always encouraged but not necessary!

1) What are my printing options? I see the word gicleé thrown around a lot

2) Any printing company recommendations? Either online or in the NYC or Boston area. Am I better off with an art-specific printing company or would Kinko's do the trick?

3) How should I be saving files of my art to be printed? 300 dpi

4) Recommendations for places to sell online? Etsy seems to dominate

5) What's the usual procedure for sending prints to a buyer? Do I hand-sign prints

Title: Flights of Fantasy I

Author: Thomas Joseph Kenney

Also


What I'm looking for:

In short my book is about a little boy who plays too many video games, but definitely not super-deformed. I'm not looking for detail, I could care less about fabric folds or lighting and textures; what I want is expressions. I want the face of the boy to seem like he's viewing the greatest thing he ever saw (until five minutes later in which the cycle repeats), and his sister to want nothing more than to get off the dragon and go home.


Specifics:

Boy: 12 yrs old. Brown hair, he'll make it.

Girl: Appearance wise, and wonders why there's a dragon in the first place.

Dragon: Western European fire-breathing dragon of the princess kidnapping type. Not the eastern snake-like variety.

Town: Generic suburban track homes that a typical middle class family in the western US would inhabit.

Framing: I'd like the top third or so to be sky which is where the title will go. The main action across the center third with the kids and dragon, I wouldn't be contracting out.

Im looking to commision some art work for my girlfriend. Its meant as a present but to be honest im pretty lost as to what I should get her commissioned. Rather than contacting people directly I figured I would post roughly what I was looking for here and see who had good ideas and the time to create it! I have a decent budget so hit me with your best ideas.

About my girlfriend: she likes pandas and unicorns and shes italian. I was thinking maybe a portrait of her and me? or just a portrait of her? Or additionally just something insane... like her riding a unicorn? I found some links of artists that she likes/has bought work from as a point of reference for the type of style I know she likes.

Hi there
My names Emily. I'm wondering if any of you wonderful redditors have any use or desire for some fine art. I'm working on supplementing my current job's income with paintings and drawings. I was injured on the job and have been on temporary worker's compensation since Valentines Day, but I still have this mountain of debt that I need to tackle, and without my serving job, I can't see when that is going to happen.   

So my request for assistance is that if anyone needs any gifts for family members, you might think of me and see if there is anything that I can do for you. If you've been really wanting your favorite TV personality glorified on your wall, perhaps a painting would do just the trick. If you've wanted to find a really cool birthday gift for your mom and you wanted a portrait of you and your siblings done, I can do that for you. Whatever you want. I'll do nsfw stuff (here's me working on a [nsfw](http://imgur.com/CJUGR) drawing). Really. Whatever you want.   

I have prints available of a lot of my art [here](http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/emily-jones.html) and there is a large variety of prices. 

I've made fan art of Lady Gaga for a friend [Lady Gaga](http://imgur.com/8BxWv) I'm hoping to get into painting a few other portraits. A few portraits from the Big Lebowski are currently on my easel.   

Here's my favorite [pooch](http://imgur.com/IjH15) in painting form. My buddy had me paint this from a photo I took of his pup.   
I've also done a few drawings for my friends. This is my buddy's [dog](http://imgur.com/7gM7A) and this is my bestie's huge [cat](http://imgur.com/jhEAJ).  

I've had some really amazing people on reddit commission work from me and it's helped me out tremendously

 [SoggyBarSoap](http://www.reddit.com/user/SoggyBarSoap)was the first wonderful redditor to commission work from me. About two months ago
That's just one style that I do

[lockestockbarrel](http://www.reddit.com/user/lockestockbarrel) and [bsteinfeld](http://www.reddit.com/user/bsteinfeld)  both commissioned portraits of their pooches from me. This is bsteinfeld's gorgeous dog Cici that he had me do based on some really wonderful photography that he does. Here's [Cici](http://imgur.com/IY6oN).  There's a little tardis easter egg in the top left corner. 

lockestockbarrel had me do two portraits of his dogs. Here is his cutie [Mudpie](http://imgur.com/XE2Kg) and his other cutie [Frida](http://imgur.com/KcwiL). I just got those pups shipped out today

It would really help me out if there was anything I could do for anyone. If you're interested, prices, or anything at all.   






TL;DR: You buying art from me will help me pay my rent and bills

Thank you so very much for your time everyone! I hope I'll hear from anyone soon!

The book opens with a lush green garden with a stone water fountain.  A thirteen year old boy carries a small girl dressed in white towards the fountain.  The girl will have a ribbon in her hair. 

As far as style goes I was thinking of enlisting an artist who is capable of multiple.  It is my intention for her to ultimately pick the style but am thinking of two kinds myself.

A dark oil on canvas in the realm of [this](http://www.burnside.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/images/Margaret_Slape-Phillips__Siamese_Morning__Oil_on_Canvas.jpg) and a fleeting in time/whimsical vector based similar to [this](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2244/2433661945_00baff447b.jpg).

Budget: $50-$60 (negotiable)

I plan on being the contact for payment and her the contact for style.  Ideally I would find someone with a website to show off their works and then I'm not just handing her an email address.

Ideas for how to better arrange this are also appreciated.  I am aware of canvasmatch and will explore that option if [/r/artstore](/r/artstore) does not work out.  I would prefer to help fellow redditors if possible.

On my blog a while back

Most of the collection still exists on the internets [at my flickr

Eventually I decided they should all be together and so I collated them all and put them into a book.

I drew 5 'special' Entertainers ( None of these five have appeared on the internet

I'm currently selling the book via blurb ( mainly because it's easier to get it out to the whole world that way )

[You can buy a copy of the book here http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1493021](http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1493021)

I can work with practically any medium, and my interests vary greatly.

Here is my new imgur gallery with a handful of pieces I've done for people in the past. Please excuse the few shoddy iPhone snaps!

http://mrparafino.imgur.com/all/

I won a National silver medal at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards  for the piece titled ""3.jpg"" in 2010.

The image of the plantains is a piece I'm working on currently for a customer's living room. This watercolor is 24.75"" x 40"". It is one of three pieces they're having me do.

I thought I would be getting my check for a new gig sooner, I can only ask that you direct them to me. Illustration and art is one of the few things I can do well. I am also self-taught. I really only do this because it's one of the few things that makes me happy, putting out a nice finished piece. However that happiness is eclipsed by the idea that my daughter might grow up without unnecessary struggle.
I don't want sympathy, please recommend me. I can do things for as low as $35 and I am willing to work with clients.

She is a HUGE Disney fan (huge in regards to her love to all things Disney, shall we say, Disney-fied.

Think taking a picture and making it into a cartoon in the style of Disney

Problem is I can't draw

I'm open to the medium (pen and ink, oil, digital, etc.) and am willing to pay in Reddit Gold or US $. However, I do have some disclaimers;

*  I am interested in something done in the style of Classic Disney. Not anime, Picasso's Blue Period, Andy Warhol, Eighteen Century Chinese Pottery or any other style.

*   I have a picture to go off of

*   I do have a firm deadline for this (I need it in my possession by Aug. 31st

*   No giving my wife oversized Marvel superhero tits. Her tits are fine as is.

Anyone capable

THANKS!
