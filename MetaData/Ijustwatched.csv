Went in expecting total garbage

Verdict? Not bad 

The Good: 

- Excellent overall creature effects.
- Excellent tie-ins to ALMOST everything from the 1982 version.
- Mary Elizabeth Winstead played a solid lead character. 
- Movie ends with a helicopter flying to the American base
- You could tell in every scene (save the last 15 minutes) that the people making this were huge fans. LOTS of effort put into recreating as many scenes as possible from the Norwegian portion of the first film. 

The Bad:

- The atmosphere doesn't come close to the 1982 version.
- No music score to speak of
- The last 15 minutes destroyed this film for me. It felt like the ""studio pressure"" ending. It didn't feel like the rest of the film
- The creature's ""abilities"" are enhanced in this version
- You don't know what happens to 1 of the characters. BIG no-no IMHO. 

Unsure:

- LOTS of creature shots. Very little ""what am I looking at"". I liked it
- LOTS of action. This was an *agressive* Thing. No fucking around when found out or cornered. This creature was pissed the hell off from the get go. It hid in human bodies about as much as it was running around attacking people brute-force.

Colin Farrell plays Ray, terribly good at it. He is probably in his mid-20s, but still displays the tendencies (and comical facial expressions) of a teenager; he’s a sulky little git who wants nothing to do with anything cultural, or anything not involving Dublin, women or drugs. He reminds me of [Kevin the teenager]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqm8JGnSshE). 

Ken (played by Brendan Glesson) on the other hand is an experienced hit-man who is an oasis of calm and authority. Ken loves culture and loves being in Bruges, almost. Ray does manage to find some fun in the town (‘which is like a fuckin’ fairytale’) involving ‘two manky hookers and a racist dwarf’, and copious amounts of drugs. Somewhat surprisingly, Ken allows himself to become embroiled in this fun… because he’s had a very very bad day, and perhaps isn’t the completely sensible, responsible father figure we first thought. 

This is top class dark comedy, is far darker than I’d realised. The first watch (a year or two ago) had me belly laughing out loud; really, some of the things that come from Ray’s mouth are completely outrageous; the second watch allowed me to string it all together a bit more and appreciate that there is a sensitive soul with a terrible secret from his past behind the sulky little git who is Ray. 

If you like Hollywood endings where everything is tied up neatly, terrible person for what you just laughed at, appreciating some good acting (I’m looking at you, Ralph Fiennes) and enjoying some beautiful scenery (remember: it’s like a fuckin’ fairytale), then please do watch this, and enjoy.

*The Shining* is a well-known Stanley Kubrick film, chances are you know all that!

Following an idea in the documentary *Room 237* [(link)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085910) about *The Shining*, patterns that repeat symmetrically, duals and twins.  I guess someone noticed that the start and end of the film had some common elements, and wanted to see if they'd track all the way through.  Oddly enough *(coincidence?!?!)* they kinda do!

(Just to be super clear:  it's like if you had one screen, but one print was wound on its reels backwards.  You start both projectors, overlaying the frames.  So at first you're seeing the opening helicopter sequence on atop the backwards-flowing final credits, the final ballroom photograph, then the maze, etc.)

Whether or not it was intentional, if you wanted the thrill of discovery for yourself:

* [Jack's thrashing rage-dance down a hallway, flinging pots and pans on the ground.](/spoiler)  Very similar physical movements, but unlike anything else in the film.
* I never even noticed this detail before
* I was really struck by one simple fact: that [the midpoint of the film occurs during Jack's sexy/gross Room-237 encounter.  So, the locus of evil around which the film rotates and from which the hotel's evil radiates.](/spoiler)

Her aimless life is rejuvenated upon receiving a call that she’s been selected to appear on television

The film unflinchingly depicts helplessness and dependency, while they remain fixated on their hopes and goals, drugs are tearing them apart. Although drug abuse is shown in the most negative of lights, it isn’t moralised about – there is no good and evil, just unfortunate souls consumed by their own sickness. It’s this ambiguity that makes ‘Requiem’ so effective. The crippling effect of addiction is apparent but it raises countless questions that it invites the viewer to analyse. The theme of dependency on a substance, but also friends and family is raised throughout – so even if the concept of drug abuse is far removed from our own lives the reliance on others will resonate with everyone. Indeed Sara’s core struggle is no longer feeling needed – “Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got

This is a spellbinding piece of filmmaking with exceptional performances from all the cast – Ellen Burstyn in particular is remarkable as the vulnerable Sara - as well as frequently inventive cinematography and camera techniques that were groundbreaking on its release in 2000. Unfortunately the quick close up cuts of drug preparation and dilating pupils, but as the film’s language has now passed into pop culture, its visual impact has been severely blunted. The same can be said for the music, a wonderful dark minimal score by Clint Mansell that sweeps over the jarring tactile images beautifully – but has since been repurposed as the theme for Sky Sports News (amongst others), creating an irritating distraction for any UK sports fans, especially as the main theme ‘Lux Antenna’ is such a prominent part of the film itself.

As with all Aronofsky’s work it engages physically as well as emotionally. He’s created a terrifying, this is an exceptional piece of cinema.

Also, the one thing I really liked about it the first time I saw it was that it left SO MUCH up to your own imagination to flesh out and figure out yourself, whereas the Director's Cut more or less serves everything up on a silver platter and takes away most of the intrigue (ie. the voiceovers in Blade Runner). 

Case in point: the Philosophy of Time Travel is never really dug into in the Theatrical version, entire pages of the book are shown on the screen, explicitly explaining what was happening in the movie, and the passages from the book are more or less nonsense and only make sense in the context of the movie so it detracted from the film for me in a big way (I guess the idea of the book is cool, I just wasn't a fan of the execution, a lot of it sounded like new age nonsense and the Theatrical version is almost a sci-fi movie since it omits a lot of that stuff and makes it seem like the book is grounded in reality and has scientific backing). If the book was included as an extra, either in physical form or as a Special Feature, which is the best part

Anyway

The Artist - This was fantastic and really enjoyable; I wouldn't be upset at all if it won Best Picture. The people making it tried something brave

The Descendants - I enjoyed this one. George Clooney was really good

Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close - I felt like there was a good movie here that was completely lost due to the poor casting and poor acting on part of the lead child actor. Had this movie been made with the cast of The Tree of Life it would have possibly been great. Or even if just the child star had been the kid from Hugo

The Help - I enjoyed this movie a lot and felt it was great at the time, that is a real movie cliche, don't call me a racist...google it.

Hugo - On April 15th, ""Martin Scorsese's next film is going to be a kid's movie in 3D? ARE YOU F-ING KIDDING ME?!? Come on!"" But I will eat my words, that f-ing kid's movie was incredible and beautiful and I loved it. Perhaps my favorite of the nine films. I will never doubt you again Mr. Scorsese, please accept my humble apology...

Midnight in Paris - Damn, it was perhaps the most enjoyable and one that I will go back to just to lose myself in. Sweet and Lowdown is still my favorite Woody Allen film, but this might be a second...

Moneyball - Good movie and like the Social Network last year it presents a story that is still interesting even if you have no interest at all in the subject matter. I had no interest in the subject matter and I made it through this one without complaint...

The Tree of Life - I like to call this one ""Beautiful Bullshit"" or ""The movie for those who thought that 2001 was too fast-paced and action-packed."" This movie was a real chore to get through, it could have been excellent.

War Horse - Steven Spielberg needs to retire. He has taken what I assume is good source material and has turned it into a cliche-ridden mess. It's still better than his movie, so almost anything can be better than that.

Ok

I fully expect The Artist to win Best Picture.

Bottom line? If you *know* you'll enjoy this film

EDIT: I wanted to add a little more after a few hours' reflection. 

I watched the first film on the recommendation of a friend. I knew nothing about it at the time and was expecting something more along the lines of a cheesy sci-fi/horror B-movie involving a 50 foot tall human centipede. I can't say the film affected me too much. I found it more laughable than sick. Sure

The second film is actually much less of a sequel than it is an expansion on the original idea. It looks and feels nothing like the first. You would never have known it was a sequel if it wasn't for the fact that the whole point of the fim is the first one. It builds on the original idea in an unexpected and fairly clever way, it was very well done.

The pacing and tone of the film is...awkward. Unsettlingly so. Where the original progressed very much like a standard film, a few lines here and there) and drawn out shots didn't seem to end, but the film actually seemed to fly by (granted, it's only 87 mins long anyway).

There's a heavy amount of Kryptonian mythology implemented throughout, or so, minutes. They use a lot of flashbacks, intermixed with Clark traveling toward something.

The thirty or forty minute mark is where the action really begins. I never truly felt how powerful Superman really was until this film. The special effects really work in the film's favor.

Michael Shannon definitely dominates in this movie. His General Zod is intimidating and powerful. Yet

Of course, they always show people in the western world as watching their modern TVs in their living rooms, while anyone in Asian and Middle eastern countries is in a large group, in some dingy restaurant, crowded around an old, crappy TV? Or worse, in the middle of a desert

Greetings all! I'm a military service member


All I can say is


Zack Snider is back in form, character portrayal, and overall feeling for scenes.


Christopher Nolan has been/is/will continue to be one of my favorite writers. He has weaved a back story for this movie so amazing that you completely understand everything about why Kal-el was sent to earth. In the first film


Henry Cavill (unknown to me before now) is completely convincing as the lead. Even the children actors portraying his early life are consistent with his acting in every way. You seriously believe that every younger character has contributed to the way he becomes when he is grown.


Michael Shannon......I've seen many a film with Michael Shannon. Bug and Premium Rush come to mind. In both instances, so..... I can't describe it. He makes Zod come to life in a way that I never would have thought possible.


And a sleeper: Antje Traue. It's been a while since I've seen a truly bad-ass female character. Despite her having plenty of screen time

Going into this film, that I shouldn't be deceived by the title and that it had almost nothing to do with driving and was very very slow and ""artsy"". Three, that it was exceptionally violent. I'm going to be honest, I didn't give a shit about seeing this movie before all the hubbub about how ""dramatic"" and violent it was because I foolishly thought it was just another F&amp;F flick.

God, Gosling was perfect in his role. I didn't know *what* was going to happen from scene to scene. I've always been a fan of mob films and absolutely *love* films like Melancholia (in regards to the pacing and tone), so.. yeah, I don't know, this was just perfect.

I can totally see why some people might not like it--I get it, and feel as if a film with no talking is a film not worth watching. Trust me, I completely understand because I used to be like that. Obviously things have changed for the better(wanting to be a screenwriter and being ridiculed by journalists for passing up ""those films"" will do that to ya) because I'd be missing out on amazing little gems like this one.

What it seems to come down to is that films like this and Sucker Punch are poorly marketed to audiences in order to appeal to what studios think they want to see (even if the film has nothing to do with what's alluded to in the trailer). I, but that's because going in I knew that it was basically a 90-minute music video and was pleasantly surprised it had dialog. Such a shame though that the bigwigs feel as if they have to trick people into seeing movies because they can't trust the film to just stand on its own feet.

Anyway, and aesthetically pleasing cinema.

2) Empathic touches.  This is something we are taught

Where Se7en felt more about the actual crimes and investigation, mostly in the first act.

Captivating and gritty, California neighborhood. That moment alone captures the essence of the time the Zodiac Killer went on his rampage.

I liked the idea that there were three layers of humanoids in this film:  the ""engineers"", who reminded me of Roy from Blade Runner.  The film touched on some existential issues but never really resolved any of them, which, of course, is sort of the point.

My two biggest plot gripes are: 1) What motivation did David have for infecting Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) with the evolution juice (or whatever that black shit was)? and 2) Why was it such a big deal that the old man was secretly on the trip with them?  I get that he wants to conquer death...was it supposed to be the hidden agenda behind the entire trip?

Starring: Matt Damon

Story: In the year 2154

Review: I am a fan of Neill Blomkamp's first film District 9 so I was looking forward to seeing how he handled his second film. The story is well written and in my opinion very original. I haven't heard of or seen anything like this movie and so that was a real delight. The premise was well thought out and this reflected in the film.

The highlight of the film is that it is a social and political commentary on how our world is now and what it could be in the future, excelled technology and access to knowledge of technology, and last but not least the overwhelmed medical field.

These nuances coupled with the plot line that makes you wonder if Matt Damon's character

I have to say I felt a lackluster performance from Matt however. The scenes where he's suppose to seem emotional or complicated make him seem cold and doesn't allow the audience to attach ourselves to him nor root for him and his love interest. Also Jodie Foster's character was well done but there was small hiccup to her performance. I don't know if the sound was off at the theater (I don't think it was because other characters sounded fine) but Jodie Foster's sentences sounded and looked like they were badly dubbed over in the editing room. I don't know if this was because she has a different accent in real life and that wouldn't go well with the uppity persona she was giving or what happened but her lips didn't move in sync with her words.

On the other hand Sharlto Copley

The action sequences were spot on in some places where they had more room to film but in others the shots were too close and you just saw blurred arms and legs. There was a few great almost slow-mo shots where you felt like you were there in the action with the characters. There was one in particular where I believe they had strapped the camera to the back of Matt Damon giving us a great over the shoulder shot of the action. I wouldn't have been mad if they filmed part of it like that. Cinematography and cgi was well used in this. They had props where they needed them and cgi where they needed it. It wasn't all Cgi'ed like you see in a lot of films. I keep wondering if they used models at all for the space portions but I couldn't tell from my viewing.

I give the overall movie a 7 for effort and originality but it lacked in acting

So

What a mammoth let-down.

Let's start with the good:

* Michael Fassbender was brilliant, graceful, charming and terrifying all in one. A deeply unnerving character, with shades of grey, depth, complexity - everything I hoped for.

* It looked beautiful. From set design

* Noomi Rapace was decent

* Some of the body-horror moments were excellent


The bad:

* Nigh on everything else. I hate to nitpick a film but the story was so horribly broken that I found it hard to pay attention to the events on screen. Right from the first briefing I was annoyed at little things (hey, but the overall plot was bollocks too. When you produce a film in the Alien universe and manage to have a more broken and nonsensical story than AvP, god help you. 

* The science was abysmal (the DNA matches!).

* The character actions were totally illogical and inconsistent. This is possibly explained by everyone apart from those I've already mentioned being forgettable and interchangeable pretty much. I guess the writers forgot who was who and just made them do whatever they wanted at whatever point to advance the events in the order they saw fit. At all times, with the big set-pieces in place, but the connective tissue just roughly sketched in until someone came along and fleshed it out with logical connections and motivations - except that never happened. 

* The engineer was no way near big enough

* The fan-service monster at the very end was pretty rubbish-looking.

I like to think that there is a director's cut out there that's actually good

Generally speaking, I am sick, and when you're sick, you need to watch a film, ideally one that you can deduce the entire plot from the IMDB summary/back of the DVD box/trailer.

There were absolutely no surprises

Action comedy is a much more difficult genre to get properly right than it may seem, with the perfect mix of both.  Films that make fun of the film industry can also seem a bit self-indulgent if not done well, and this one didn't fall into that trap either; the whole film was worth it just for the parody trailers at the beginning.  There was a nice mix of intelligent and immature humour, and not too much of either.  While not a film I'm going to be mulling over for any length of time after, it made for a wonderfully entertaining couple of hours, which was exactly what I was after.

-didn't know what to expect (didn't see any trailers) but DAMN it was good

-had heard J. Black gave a career defining performance and now wholeheartedly agree. Props.


**This movie would appeal to people who enjoy**

-comedians taking on more serious roles 

-fake mockumentary style movies (think District 9)

-quirky small-town settings (this one's set in Texas)

-movies adapted from true real life events

**Loved how**

-the leadup to, even though the actual outcome in hindsight was fairly obvious. 

-it gets you to sympathize/root for Bernie and against the DA/justice system

-it portrays Southern folk in a positive yet fair and realistic light

-they used the actual townspeople who knew the real Bernie

-awesome the end credits were


**Other thoughts:**

-It sucks no one has heard of this movie. 

-I wonder how Zach Galifanakis would have pulled this character off.

IJW: Withnail and I (1987)
(Text post)
(IMDB link)
Two struggling actors who are surviving on benefits live together in a grim council flat in London in the 1960s. They never seem to get any work and yet there’s always money for booze. When the booze runs out, Withnail, becomes so depressed about this state of affairs that one day that he decides to ask his uncle Monty if they can borrow his cottage in the UK countryside to get away for a holiday for a while. Monty happily agrees, and they totter off on holiday but with consequences neither of them could have possibly anticipated. 

I liked this film, I rate it 6.5. 

***Here’s an example of a lengthier review that we’d love to see
(Text post)
(IMDB link)
Two struggling actors who are surviving on benefits live together in a grim council flat in London in the 1960s. The flat is disgusting: there’s weeks of washing up piled in the sink, along with a guy with a GINORMOUS joint (named the ‘Camden carrot’) have a couple of entertaining scenes. 

When the booze runs out it’s not beyond them to resort to anything in the flat and they argue about who drank the last of whatever contains alcohol… metholated spirits

Withnail gets fed up with the monotony and asks his thespian uncle Monty if they can borrow his cottage in the British countryside to get away for a holiday (for just long enough for them to get back in time to claim their next dole money).  Antics and hilarity occur… 

***SPOILERS FOLLOW***

So after a drunken journey they arrive to a ramshackle cottage with no heat
Uncle Monty takes a liking to ‘I’
The locals display extreme hostility when asked if they can purchase food from them. However

What do others think of the humour of this film? What’s your favourite line? It’s amazing to think that such a small budget (now ‘cult’) film launched Richard E Grant’s career so rapidly.  Do you think Monty would’ve had a different reaction to ‘I’ if he’d attended a ‘common’ university?! IMDB rate it 7.7

**The Italian shoes.** It may have been a mind game knowingly played by Nixon, or at least I saw it as Nixon seeing them as such. I think it was a statement on how Nixon was an out-of-date traditionalist, someone who would rather defeat other people's notions of what was right rather than accept any kind of introspection or personal progress to line up with those notions. Frost, on the other hand, didn't have to put nearly as much effort into not being an asshole. It reminded me of the House Atreides/House Harkonnen dichotomy in Dune: the former attracted followers by being likable and also firm, but the other demanded submission or they'd have you killed. I'm still sussing out my thoughts on the shoes, but the adversarial tone of the film combined with Nixon calling them effeminate and then getting a pair of them from the man who beat him

**The fighting metaphor.** Nixon describes the interview as ""no-holds-barred"" and ""a duel."" The title of the film even looks like a fight card from a boxing match. In the late-night raving phone call (that apparently never actually happened, but in the late rounds Frost hit him with the knockout punch by getting him to say the famous ""If the president does it it's not illegal"" line and won the bout. He didn't admit much at all and barely admitted any culpability, but it was enough of a blow that it's all people really remember. They don't think of the droning about Khruschev and Mao, they remember him saying the President can do what he wants as long as it's ""in the interest of national security,"" and I use those scare quotes very deliberately here.

**Frank Langella's absolutely spot-on performance.** In his review of the new Star Trek movie, but that's a *good* thing. If you want technical skill at impressions, watch Game Change, but as Sam Rockwell's character mentions, visual media like film and TV have the power of distillation, and Langella took full advantage of that. He played Nixon as a dominating and subtly cruel man, but in spite of all that and how he betrayed the trust of the American people, I really did feel for him. He seemed genuinely contrite

Still, which has let the corruption fester. Because of that knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days in a personal hell of self-loathing, and even worse, he knew he would and knew it was his own fault. Even worse than that is that his ego wouldn't let him air out that fault. I know failure, but I don't know failure on that grand a scale. It has to really, really hurt, I felt pretty bad for Nixon the man. All that internal conflict takes a lot of chops to convey

**This post contains spoilers** (not like the cars

I am aware that I am kind of late to the party considering most of reddit recommends or has seen this movie. I was shocked on how entertaining and thought provoking the movie was I was shocked seeing it for the first time with no knowledge of the plot or premise. I had to re-watch several scenes just to make sure some of the instances were correct. For example, the part that hit me right in the gut was that the psychiatrist noticed and knew James' younger self immediately and looked at him in the way that she feels sorry for him and that everything will be ok. But its not. That was so important for this movie because it brings up so many ironic situations. The couple was on their way to a relationship that lasted beyond their knowledge of when each other existed, but it all tumbles down in seconds. I found that it was ironic that even though time travel was possible, even going back in time in a matter of seconds to events, like Jose (James cellmate), there still was not enough time to stop the assistant scientist. I was equally intrigued of how ironic the situation on the plane led the same future scientist, who met the assistant in person


The critical error that the future makes is how unpredictable one person can be when they themselves don't have any motive before certain events take shape. In this scenario, who joked about his life in the future about a deadly virus. So technically, ether James killed the population by accident, or that the assistant saw an opportunity to do evil and took it.


So from all this gibber-jabber of my thoughts and connections I found, if it can't be answerable, who was talking to James in his mind. If the time travel machine was messed up, how or why did it fluctuate to WW1 before 1996. Those are small nitpicks, but I believe that the best scenario would be the future scientist personally knowing that she met the most dangerous man in the world and fucked it up.


Go watch it if you have not.

Possible Spoilers Ahead!

Memento is the third, a man who can't create new memories. So he uses a series of notes and tattoos to help him find out who killed his wife. The film's structure is split up into two parts. The colored portions of the movie actually proceed backwards, while the black &amp; white proceed in chronological order. This mean these sequences proceed at the end, and beginning, of the story and meet at the middle. Alright, enough with the plot summary. I loved this movie. It was one of the most rewarding film experiences I've ever had because it's extremely rewarding to find where the connective tissue lies between the events. Not that that's the only thing that's good about the film. The dialogue is great, and the performances by Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss are fantastic. The ending is mind blowing. SPOLIERS: Leonard helps kill a man who's named John G., because he killed John G.  over a year ago. He also lied to himself, not Sammy's. Leonard forgot about the killing of the right John G., ""Don't believe his lies

Memento is a tightly structured and plotted story that has themes about revenge and betrayal. It is a fantastic movie that is a modern classic. Christopher Nolan has done it again!

Man, a common criticism of 2001 . But it was worth it! This movie has the most beautiful imagery ever! The special effects are awesome, and still hold up to this day. The story is also great, with some mind boggling themes about technology and evolution. This is a film that you can sit down and just watch. It is so thought provoking and crazy! HAL is a great character, and his departure made me a little sad. I only have one or two criticisms about the film. WARNING: STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING SPOILED. My first is the switch of main characters. In the first act of the film, our main character is Dr. Heywood Floyd, who helps discover the monolith on the moon. But in the second and third acts, who played a big part in setting up the events for the Jupiter mission. It almost feels like two different movies. Also, all in all

&gt;I should warn everyone that there may be some spoilers in &gt;this review.

The movie was great

I'm a huge fan of unconventional storytelling. This movie had that

The main problem was with the characters.

 Many of them (Dick Liddil

 It made me feel like I missed something. 

The other problem was with Jesse James. The progression from ""good to bad"" in this film was very sudden

Now once I did look past these problems, I really really enjoyed it. 

The cinematography was great. (as always expected by Deakins) 

The soundtrack is one of my favorites. 

I'm not a huge fan of music playing a large role in movies... I feel like scenes should speak for themselves

There are many scenes of this movie that had my heart pounding. The use of the powerful music

I almost forgot about Robert Ford. 

The character of Robert is incredible. Casey Affleck's acting was perfect in his role

I wish I could say more about his character

It was probably one of my favorite characters. 

I didn't really like the first quarter of this movie. It felt slow

What I believe makes a good film is a plot which drives the human journey in which the audience ultimately connects with and relates with. I think that is where M. Night’s Unbreakable film succeeds the most. Each character undergoes an arch which is set off by the comic book themes of superpowers and good vs evil. This is especially impactful because it is shown through the microcosm of David’s family and their interactions with Elijah Price. The train crash, there is a prevalent theme of awakening lost or dormant truths within. Everyone is trying to make sense of what is happening around them, but moreover it is a desire to assume destined roles which are unknown or uncertain to them. Elijah wants to know his existence on this earth, as fragile as it is, serves a higher purpose. David feels sadness in his day to day causing him to be passive and quiet, in many scenes with his wife Audrey, she will say dialogue that normally would illicit action or emotion but David does little and says nothing. Something holds him back from being a good husband or a strong father figure. David’s son Joseph struggles with the possibility of his father moving to New York, Elijah becomes the super villain

I especially like Josephs relationship arch. Finding out his father is essentially superman, probably a child’s second best discovery would be finding out your dad was one. I will admit this element in the movie strikes a special place in my own heart because I look up to my own father very much. The scene where Joseph “helps"" David lift weights always makes me smile and at the end, when David slides Joseph the newspaper clipping -always puts the feelings inside of me… ;D

This film is certainly not without its flaws. One being, especially ones with just him and his wife Audrey). Some other of the film’s weaknesses and I am being nitpicky now, is the film’s score being really ill-fitting at times, the opening titles especially sounds like it should be played while shopping at a high-end euro boutique -which completely drew me out of what could have been a particularly interesting opening scene where we see Elijah being just born with broken arms and legs. Also, something I personally loathe is unnecessary text in the beginning tossing out comic book statistics (wtf?) and at the very end explaining that Elijah is in the looney bin at the end. That makes me especially livid, and what I think is what is really wrong with the film industry (a rant for a latter date) -what a missed opportunity! I’d much rather have been left wondering, what happened to Elijah, now aware that superheroes exist

All in all, where it is much more heavy-handed, those movies are cool because they are a culmination of cool things shown to us. It is a buffet of visual awesomeness, where Bruce Wayne fights ninjas, flies around as Batman, uses gadgets and beats up the Joker. Those are awesome scenes shown realistically. This film is amazing because it is less about seeing super heroic things on screen and more about thinking of the real world repercussions of such ideas. How the hell did M. Night make this...

Hard Candy is probably the most underrated movie of its kind, first as the seemingly unaware victim, then as the hunter, which impressed me, as she had just finished her junior year in high school. Patrick Wilson plays Jeff Kohlver, the predator, very well. Although his character does not develop quite as much as Page's, and he definitely does change. Both Page and Wilson did an incredible job.

The story-telling in Hard Candy is very good. With only two major roles, great camera work complete with tastefully done rough cuts, superb work by digital colorist Jean-Clement Sorter, and of course the two stars' amazing acting keep both the tension and the viewer's interest alive.

What left the biggest impression on me, and both views would be just as solid as the other. Many people become outraged at Hayley, and they find it hard not to sympathize with Jeff. To them, the movie becomes the story of an angry, disturbed teenager who attacks anyone she thinks deserves it, and to them, Hayley becomes a sociopath. Others cheer Hayley and her conquest. She becomes not a sick, but an intelligent and passionate person, touched, but we supply the answer. That is the beauty of Hard Candy."

Equally adept at being a disturbing mockumentary and a side-splitting comedy, is part of what makes this unusual little film so fascinating, and considering its shoestring budget it's quite impressive. When something successfully makes you laugh over and over again about the most appalling violence, whilst simultaneously making you feel slightly uneasy about it, it has to be doing something very right. The grimness of the b/w photography and the surprisingly natural acting gives it an air of realism that is generally absent in other mockumentaries.

Due to the intelligent, whose line delivery is spot-on, the film does the impossible of making you root with one of the most vile characters ever on screen. Even though a very small part of me thought how wrong and morally bankrupt the content it is, I couldn't help but grin uncontrollably when watching Ben do his job. He's sadistic, cruel, and repugnant, and yet so entertaining and charismatic. It's lines such as “Usually I start the month with a postman” matched with a blunt murder scene that make the film such a memorable and hilarious experience. Man Bites Dog provides the darkest of dark humor and strong undertones of social commentary

For a long time *Lady in the Water* was my favorite Shyamalan movie, begins to realize that he is a superhero. 

What I really like about this movie is how subtle it is. It's not the typical origin story where the hero realizes his power, and they have a face-off at the end. This film is paced well, showing Willis' slow progression and development eventually ending with him accepting who he is. Nothing was over the top and it felt quite realistic with Willis going through troubles with his wife and son. 

There were also a few intense scenes that I enjoyed. My only real gripe was that the ending comes immediately after the twist (which was awesome

The Iron Giant is a film I've neglected for far too long and having now seen it I wish I went to see it back when seeing the TV ads for its cinematic release. Not only is it staggeringly beautiful in its animation, and the computer-generated Iron Giant, it is a deeply moving story of compassion and friendship that is guaranteed to break both kids and adults. At the center of the film is the smart but dorky Hogarth Hughes, roughly 10 years old and without father or friends. He seeks refuge in cheesy Horror and Sci-Fi flicks he catches on TV and the plethora of comic books he owns. Although this fixes his loneliness temporarily it is clear from his behaviour that he is in desperate need of a real, unconditional friendship.

Here is where the Iron Giant comes into play and although his size and appetite for anything metal are intimidating at first he is calm and sensitive in nature. His child-like manners juxtaposed with his incredible, magical and moving to the point of goosebumps. Their friendship is so beautifully captured and developed within such a relatively small time-frame, it is a wonder the film even works let alone resonates so strongly.

Not a moment is wasted, every single frame is precious and done with care. Bird proved himself to not only be a fantastic animator but also a true storyteller and one of the medium's finest. The Iron Giant has a heart bigger than its titular character. Its powerful climax and inspiring message of compassion will move, shake and eventually break anyone willing to really let the film breathe in all its sensuous wonder. Escapism at its finest and an essential for kids, parents and anyone ever. There are a series of lines spoken by Hogarth and the Giant towards the end that are so simple and natural they could only come from people passionate about wanting to tell a story and do it with grace. Bird and everyone involved in this masterpiece poured their hearts into it and created a film so rich and illuminating it is absolutely shameful to think how poorly it did on release and how relatively forgotten it is by now.

The Iron Giant is gorgeous on its surface and absolutely awe-inspiring on the inside. The combined force of the writing

Oh dear. Oh dear

It started quite well, call Tom Cruise!) and they blew up MI6 again, so it was all a bit old hat Bond coming back from the dead was accomplished and over with fine, but it didn't really seem to matter in any way. 

One of the overall themes was about the old vs the new, not whether he was too old. But they gave him a bit of a haggardy beard to hammer the point home, so whatever.

Bond flies around the world a bit

Its not that I don't like Javier Bardem. Its just that it devolves into talking about nothing. The script goes nowhere. Most of the talk in the film is just filling space it seems

So, and then escape, and then use the tube and a policeman's uniform to escape, and then crash a tube train, and then walk into a hearing that he couldn't have possibly forseen and shoot Judie Dench. The whole thing makes no frigging sense. I don't mind suspending disbelief (especially with the hilarious movie-logic computer stuff), but this was just stupid. The whole story hinges on a sequence of events that is never explained or justified or rationalised - they're just left to stand on their own, and like that the flaws are just blindingly obvious.

By the time they wheel out the Aston and the old Bond theme

We get a nice A-Team bit towards the end

On the whole the performances were great - but the words they were saying were random, which is what Bardem wanted all along, and no-one mentions the still-missing disk of MI6 operatives.

&gt;""Peter Weir's film makes much noise about poetry, Whitman and even Vachel Lindsay, as well as a brave excursion into prose that takes us as far as Thoreau's Walden. None of these writers are studied, however, in a spirit that would lend respect to their language; they're simply plundered for slogans to exort the students toward more personal freedom. At the end of a great teacher's course in poetry, the students would love poetry; at the end of this teacher's semester, all they really love is the teacher.""
&gt;

Aside from Ebert being a complete party pooper, is to use a metaphor, literally their captain in navigating their life, and the boys are his stewards. Yes the movie is a hallmark-card type of sweetness but I think the real reason that Ebert is quite negative about the movie is the fact that he considers himself a true ""bohemian"" / counter-culture, and that this Bohemian-Lite with kid-gloves on seems to just feel like a bad pandering. I think he resents the idea that suburban, rich, privileged kids can experience real defiance in the purest form of the idea, and instead, they aren't performing a ""legitamate"" art movement.

This movie was a complete failure.  I had looked forward to it since first seeing the trailer.  I found the plot interesting as well as the concept of seeing genres from all throughout cinema history being played out by 25 year olds.  For example, and so on.  


In fact, as was the performances of the entire supportign cast.  The writing was one of the most lazy scripts I had experienced in quite some time.  I couldn't have counted the cliches on all of my fingers and toes.  They reused every typical example in the book, for example running towards eachother with the clock ticking down only to not make it at the last second(who would'a thought!).


There was little to no character development, had the skills to over power an entire unit of trained officers and parkour his way out of a mansion.  He effortlessly took down a millionaire(or ""In Time""'s equivalent) in poker, with no reasoning behind his ability to do so.


The poker scene!  Holy shit what a terrible scene!  For those of you who know the game, ""It wasn't a luck, yada yada"" and bet 50,**000** years on an open ended straight draw with one card left to come(he hit the straight in the end).  There were 8 cards in the deck that could have made his hand, and he pot committed himself on a draw.


The last section of my rant concerns the big climax, overwhelmed by his potential victory, he loses focus and JT gains the upper hand.  Why couldn't this douche then realize JT began fighting back, and say, ""God damnit, let me just finish him off.""  This loss of focus lasted approximately three minutes, when the antagonist clearly noticed what JT was trying to do right away.  Aaaand lastly, who was supposed to be a legend in ""fighting"" with that strategy.  BUT HE WASN'T! His father was killed in a fight,,False

Juno is a beautiful story. It walks the line between happy and sad, cynicism, wonder, and hope mesh perfectly in a communication of Juno's feelings, and the combination of what is going on both on and off the screen is sure to keep you interested in what the movie has to say.

And Juno definitely has a lot to say. An unplanned pregnancy at 16 creates expectation. Supportive parents, in a way. Juno learns that she can't plow through growing up. She has to take something from it. She tries to maintain an indifferent attitude, and the battle between her cool attitude and the undercurrent of childlike dependence, wonder, and joy is present throughout the movie, as evidenced by Rainn Wilson's brief role as the sarcastic store clerk, Juno's making a noose out of licorice rope, and even the simple, which reflects her initial refusal to allow the world to move her

I can't write about Juno without mentioning the superb acting by the two stars. First of all, was perfect. Just perfect. I remember watching Juno and noticing I had not noticed anything about Page's acting. She was just being Juno. Then it hit me. The reason Page's performance was so brilliant was hiding in plain view. I had subconsciously credited everything Juno did to Juno. My silly brain had told me Juno was Juno. No Canadian, no actress, no Ellen Page. At second glance, however, I was struck by how in-tune Page was with her character. She played Juno so convincingly I felt and actually believed Juno's world-weary armor going down, her confusion, her wisdom, of pauses that say so much more than any monologue could communicate, lost for words. Michael Cera was the perfect choice for Paulie

I highly recommend Juno. If you haven't seen it,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,t3_1hqn2z

This film, yet deep hatred of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his plan to kill him.

The story is quite moving. Salieri's war on Mozart, but you always feel attached and you want to know how it all ends. 

What *really* makes this movie is the characters. Salieri, who he felt didn't deserve it, and leave him in the dust only with the need to be that good. The best scene was when, in his old age, he tells the priest his plan to kill Mozart and become a musical God in the eyes of the people. He says it with such intensity and passion that it scared me a bit. 

Never before have I simultaneously loved and hated a character until Mozart, a lude, egotistical, and rude man. But he's also an undeniable genius with a great passion for his art. I also felt sorry for him because of the large shadow cast by his father, even after he died. Tom Hulce did an amazing job in realizing this unpredictable character.

Another good character is Mozart's wife

* it weighs in at 2hr52
* this is a film which requires your full attention: don't watch it in the background or if you think you'll fall asleep partway through - there are several parts which
* watch the beginning of the credits where you see which actor played which roles; quite a few people in the cinema were audibly shocked (in a good way) at some of the roles and this adds to the importance of the story

I've always been a fan of Wes Anderson ever since randomly borrowing a copy of The Life Aquatic from a friend but oddly enough I didn't really watch any of the rest of his filmography until last year. I'm not quite done with him yet but I'll be stunned if Fantastic Mr. Fox, even if it deals with the critic's favourite subject of a dysfunctional family. I'll be hard-pressed to find a family more dysfunctional than the Tenenbaums and were it not for Anderson's direction the comically over-the-top quirkiness of each individual would quickly become irritating. However, and I really don't know how he does it time and time again, it simply works and despite being obscenely quirky the characters feel genuine.

Very often funny and at times highly saddening, with a warming sensitivity, making sure that every character is of equal importance and slowly creating a bond between each one of them of which most aren't aware of until the end. It's quite astonishing how there is not a single weak, even among the supporting cast, and it really reminds me of The Life Aquatic in which Anderso achieved a similar feat. The performances naturally play a big part in this and they are appropriately fantastic, off-beat when needed but, crucially, a wonderful closure to a wonderful story about a group of genuine characters I really cared for in the past two hours.

The excellence in storytelling is met in the production design of the film, it has spectacular framing, lighting and everything I've come to love about Wes Anderson's style. In the music department he once again landed a hit and his selection of songs for certain scenes continues to amaze me as he is consistently right in every decision in that regard. The Royal Tenenbaums is a rewarding experience rich in emotion and heart, boasting a plethora of great performances, and is an instant favourite of mine.

He worked for the same company for over forty years and battled cancer for most of a decade. He lost part of his lower jaw as a result and it left him with a remarkably changed appearance; some unpleasant people were publicly harsh and critical about his new appearance and it was terribly upsetting

I am very sad at his passing. I hope some readers will take some time this week to check out some of his reviews before and/or after you watch films. He was an excellent writer and really captured the essence of what was best, nobody would ever read them!).

[The Host (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517260/)

After seeing this movie, they were pretty meh to me. The complicated love story in them just didn't get my attention like it did for the target audience of the movies and books. I was mainly drawn to the curiosity of Meyer's portrayal of vampires. Like probably everyone else, the whole *sparkle in the sun* dealio was not to my forte, but the violence is what actually kept me going with the series. If Meyer did away with the complicated romance plot, I would have liked Twilight more. 

With this movie, I saw it with my mom, and it felt like she liked the Twilight series more than this while I felt vice versa. The premise was pretty interesting and blew away my initial thought of this moving being another remake of ***Invasion of the Body Snatchers***. I could see some viewing it like that in a way, but the alien invasion in this was more...*peaceful*, but still a *creepy peaceful* at that.

Saoirse Ronan, one being ***Melanie***, the human host, and the other being ***The Wanderer*** who was the alien inside the human's body. Melanie gets into this state because of an incident that leaves her body basically in a vegetative state. The alien-controlled humans use some type of medicine to heal her and then insert the alien into her body, giving The Wanderer almost all control of the body. The movie goes onto an adventure on how Melanie and The Wanderer try to find any remaining humans that could possibly fix this mixing of two beings in one.

If you combined all 4 Twilight movies (or 3 if you think the 3rd and 4th ones shouldn't have been split up into two parts) into one, I actually felt a want to read the book and to be the first to get my hands on the second book if it hasn't come out already. The ending of his movie didn't really feel like it gave away any hints that there would be more, but I would definitely or see or read the sequel.

I was *somewhat* kind of surprised by some of the graphic violence in this movie that I had no idea would be shown in it. One scene in particular was... [SPOILER](/s ""some dude literally getting his head shot off, but it was just another thing that pulled me in. I barely remember anything that graphic in the Twilight films, but the closest was just people getting their heads or limbs ripped off and magically not having blood splurging out.

What followed was an incoherent story about this stuff (literally - that's all they ever call it) that oozes out of the snow.  It kind of looks like mayonnaise.  The people of America soon decide that it's the best thing ever and it starts selling like crazy.  

One little boy sees the stuff behaving STRANGELY in his family's kitchen and decides he doesn't trust it.  His family is addicted to The Stuff (actual product name) and they say that he can't be in the family if he doesn't eat it.  At one point

Also

Their paths randomly collide somehow and they form an alliance.  The stuff continues to brainwash the country because of the awesome PR campaign that the people who sell The Stuff have embarked on.  Hot Shot Private Investigator starts banging the PR Director.  Everyone is hooked on The Stuff because it is addicting.  Apparently the writers couldn't decide on just one evil thing for the Stuff to do

The movie continues and you begin to fast forward to get to the scenes where they fight the Stuff.  They usually just set it on fire while it ominously sits in a corner of a room and jiggles.

Then the little boy gets captured and put in a truck by the Stuff people; these are people who have eaten The Stuff and are now controlled by it

Hot Shot visits his army buddy at some secret army bunker in the jungle somewhere.  Paul Sorvino plays the army buddy and is the only decent actor in this entire film.  I believe he knew it as well

Anyway

Then we find out that the people who hired Hot Shot to investigate the Stuff had ulterior motives

This movie is bound to give moviegoers more trouble than probably anything else they'll see all year. At its best

But at its worst, so misguided as to play a rape scene for laughs that will not be as forthcoming as those fist pumps. 

That unevenness is Kick-Ass 2's downfall, but this exercise does require some minor spoilers. 

Treat this like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure. At the end


##MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW##

**Scene 1 (The Worst)**

Kick-Ass's self-appointed nemesis in this movie is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and will heretofore be referred to as MF. MF assembles a team of supervillains with names like Black Death, The Tumor, and Mother Russia, and he sets out to destroy everything Kick-Ass loves. Conveniently enough for the plot, Kick-Ass has a new girlfriend who goes by (not kidding) Night Bitch. 

MF tracks down Night Bitch and breaks into her house with a couple of his fellow villains. They proceed to beat the crap out of her

Only there's a twist! MF doesn't have an erection! Oh darn it all, it's supremely uncomfortable. Night Bitch ends up goading MF a step too far, and he turns around with a special kind of look on his face that leaves it up in the air whether the rape happened or not. By the way, in the comic book, it did happen.

You can see what they did there. Comic book writer Mark Millar's original scene was too much for the movie. It was controversial when the book was released back in April

Plasse and director Jeff Wadlow both said previously the rape didn't make it into the movie. Instead, so I don't know what Wadlow was thinking with this scene. It just doesn't work. And the bad taste it left in my mouth made it hard to enjoy the following scene, which is pretty effing awesome.

**Scene 2 (The Best)**

Cut from the inside of Night Bitch's house to the outside, turns it into a bomb and hurls it at the cop car. BOOM!

For the next couple of minutes, writing, and creative stunt and fight choreography come together in a way that makes you just love watching it. And it all centers on a Russian bodybuilder named Olga Kurkulina who's never done a movie before.

This scene, and watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie multiple times, and it is flat-out fun to watch.

The problem is Kick-Ass 2 doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a movie where we get to push the limits of that fun, Kick-Ass insists, ""This isn't a comic book!"" What is that? Is it meta humor within the movie? That's deep. But no, that would be too complex. It's just cognitive dissonance disguised as social consciousness, and it deserves an eye-roll.

**Now Choose**

I've left a lot out, or violence in movies in general, I've also put together a reading list that might help you flesh out how you feel. It brings in several opinions from Stephen King, Chuck Klosterman, and comic writers Warren Ellis and Gail Simone, and all of them plug into various facets of this movie.

This film really has everything you could want or expect from a martial arts movie…… stilted dialogue, with no hint of a satirical edge. The exposition is dire but mercilessly brief, with only 50 or so lines in the whole picture – but if you pick up a DVD with resounding reviews from ‘Nuts’ and ‘Zoo’ on the cover you know what you’re signing up for. Undemanding Friday night cinema at its best, rammed with fast, brutal, head-splitting (literally) violence. 

Breathtaking is a word often thrown around, so if you missed just how talented and agile Jaa is in realtime there’s countless opportunities to marvel at his prowess. Perhaps not as well choreographed or inventive as others in the genre, its selling point is its ferocious raw power and physicality. Clunky imperfections pale into insignificance in the face of the remorseless action. Want to see a guy on fire delivering a spinning roundhouse kick to someone’s face? You’re in the right place.

Boy do I wish I could've seen this movie as a child. Henson's ambitious and wonderfully fantastical adventure carries an irresistible charm with it that surely would've amazed me at a very young age but even seeing it for the first time at age 20 is an enriching experience. The world that is created in this has a tangible quality to it that can only be achieved through actual sets, as physicality and presence are things the audience can feel. Thanks to the meticulous craft that went into every one of these aspects even shoddy effects such as the merging scene towards the end are charming and very much welcomed. I may be a sucker for world-creating but rarely have I seen a place as vividly memorable as the world of The Dark Crystal.

It is true, which they do successfully, but the story itself and the characters are very simplistic and really not as interesting as the visuals. This does not mean that they're necessarily bad, but their blandness does become apparent rather quickly. Still, these issues become secondary due to how exciting it is to visit all these places and unique creatures and due to the short 90 minutes running time they really don't matter in the slightest. It's too visually overwhelming to ever be boring, sucks you into its world before you even know it and leaves a long-lasting impression that goes way beyond the end of the film. I loved it.

In all his kids-friendly movies I always thought Robin Williams was a little creepy

As a concept, known for his work in Fincher's films, greatly adds to what makes this such an uncomfortable watch, as his overly clean, sanitized look gives places such as the supermarket it takes place in a surreal quality to them. Somewhere I read the word heaven-like being used to describe it and that is exactly what it is. Sy is detached from reality and it shows not just in his behaviour but also in the film's aesthetics. It's cleverly done and very effective, something I've come to expect from this DP.

One Hour Photo is surprisingly unsettling and a worthy psychological thriller with a fantastic ending and a very sick mind at its core. Despite his awful actions one can't help but feel sorry for him and Robin Williams gives it his best to make him human

Having never actually seen any of Lucas' non-Star Wars films I was rather excited what this one had to offer and it comes to no surprise that while it doesn't live up to Star Wars it's still leagues above the atrocious prequel trilogy. THX 1138 takes place in a dystopian future, almost awkward way the people talk to each other creates a unique atmosphere. The constant threat of the mind-controlling machines, the entirely fabricated religion and the brutally mundane working conditions hark back to the great works of Science-Fiction by Orwell and Huxley.

However, which is very well-done and a welcome change from the standing and talking. Numerous tributes to Sci-Fi classics can be found throughout, including the infamous shot of masses of workers walking through hallways from Metropolis and while it's not quite on the level as some of the stuff it pays homage to it's still a solid film with a clear goal which it more or less achieved.

The sets are unreal. I'm not sure if it is CGI or what

I never realized that the Germans made the Jews form their OWN police force to deal with the jews.  These jews got special benefits (mainly not being starved and gassed to death).  American film studios have always left this detail out

[The best scene is obviously the one where a beaten down, tells him to prove it by playing on a piano just in the next room.](/spoiler) I took a screenshot of this scene as well. http://i.imgur.com/Zm04SQl.jpg

Approximately 66% of the jews living in Europe during WWII were exterminated.  90% of the jews in Poland were killed. However

This movie will change you.  It will make you go outside and kiss the sidewalk and make you realize how lucky you really are.  I think before wars are started they should be forced to watch this movie to be reminded of how we all lose our minds when it comes to war.

PLEASE, Nicolas Cage (Adaptation), Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York).  Quite an impressive year. Polanski won for best director and was robbed of Best Picture by Chicago.

I'll start with the good stuff. I really enjoyed seeing Radcliffe in my first viewing of him in a non-HP role (I never saw his *December Boys* or *My Boy Jack*). I think that, and really helped with the scares and creepy undertones during the more relaxed scenes. I also love the way the filmmakers decided to introduce the title character - subtle, with her story being told in an easy-to-follow way without force feeding you her role in this. I don't remember what the soundtrack was like (it was more of an atmospheric hum kinda deal), but that worked SO WELL with scenes where wind-up toys were the only music (easily one of the creepiest parts of the film dealt with a room full of wind ups going simultaneously).


Now for the bad. As I mentioned earlier, this story had an extremely weak story - I barely understood/cared why he was in the town he was in, why his wife mattered (that part of the story was pretty distracting and something tells me she had a larger role in the written story). It felt like the film had 3 or 4 stories happening simultaneously, and then it only concluded 1 or 2. If anything, I'd say that the story felt so detached that you knew pretty much within the first 15 minutes that Radcliffe's character was doomed.

1. ""Hellraiser"" - I liked it. Having watched the first three when they came out in theatres I was worried the series wouldn't hold up to my memories of it. No worries here

2. ""Hellbound"" - Loved it. This is my personal favorite Hellraiser movie. I would love a 2 hour movie of nothing but cenobites fighting each other. This is also the first time you start getting a feel for who Pinhead was before the acupuncture.

3. ""Hell on Earth"" - I liked it

4. ""Bloodlines"" (aka Pinhead in space) It was pretty good. I'd say it's my third favorite of the series. Decent FX

5. ""Inferno"" I think Pinhead/cenobites/puzzlebox have about 6 minutes of actual screen time in this movie. It was painfully obvious that this was a ho-hum murder mystery/thriller movie that wasn't interesting enough so they slapped the Hellraiser logo on the box to get a few more sales. I was pleased at the production value though

6. ""Hellseeker"" It's seriously the same exact plot as Inferno except the shyamalan ""what a twist"" ending. I actually really liked the twist as it brought older cennobites and Kirsty from the first two movies back. Again though

So, let alone a prequel. I found the concept off-putting because - as a non-american - I find it hard to connect with the fraternity experience, as it bears no relation to anything I have direct experience of. Coupled with the fact that their last two films haven't been stellar (Brave I enjoyed, but it felt more like an outstanding Dreamworks effort than the great Pixar film it should have been, and Cars 2 was blah), and I was going in with mixed feelings.

Holy crap, clever, filled with brilliant details and references to both Monsters Inc and classic frathouse comedies like Animal House. There were some lovely setpieces, and great voicework from Nathan Fillion and Hellen Mirren in particular. In fact, the creature design for her character was particularly outstanding.

None of that is why I loved it. I loved it because I felt it took what could have been a fairly traditional story and subverted the structure somewhat, and the growth of the pair was handled very deftly indeed. There is less action than in the first film - there is nothing to rival the breathtaking ride on the doors in Monsters Inc - but this fits the more intimate story it tells, about personal growth, and dreams, and what we do when life forces us to adapt to harsh realities. What action does take place feels like it **matters**, rather than just being a rollercoaster of eyecandy.

By contrast, and I instantly forgot it the moment I walked out the door. Monsters University *I keep wanting to talk about*. I think that sums up the quality Pixar have when they bring their A-Game. Maybe not top 5 Pixar, but definitely top 8.

I can't say how proud I am of South Korean director, one of the best modern day filmmakers in the thriller department and he lives up to the hype with Stoker in more ways than one.

The movie starts off without giving you any of the typical Hollywood runaround of pointless back stories. You meet India, who she never knew about, has suddenly appeared in her life, a scenario India finds rather strange. But here's the great thing about Stoker: It's not hard to figure out where the movie is headed but it doesn't even matter. It's HOW Park gets there that makes the film so damn enjoyable. From India's depressed and socially withdrawn character played by the wonderfully gifted Mia Wasikowska to Matthew Goode's creepy sociopathic Uncle, the movie delivers fine acting, directing and style all in a nice little package. And yes, Nicole Kidman is also good here as India's mother, her performance isn't quite in the same league as Wasikowska's or Goode's. When you finally do find out the background on India's uncle

By the time end credits came up on the screen, didn't change his ways, made me that much more excited about whatever Park will do next. He's a great director and, once again, has made a great film.

‘Kick-Ass’ is stylistic, energetic direction – and is as easily digestible as flicking through a book. The cinematography does an excellent job of mimicking illustrated panels, providing an experience close to the speech bubbles and black outlines of the printed page, with constant narration from Dave helping to express this further. 

Intense flashes of graphic, but Dave is one of the most accurate teenage losers you’ll see in a genre movie, as awkward and cringeworthy as we all were/are. The film's real star though is Moretz’s Hit-Girl, a sweet angelic daughter whilst at home, and a highly trained merciless killer when on the streets – a conceit that will trouble many – but it's no more than mischievous, outrageous fun.

Aside from all the poppy visual enjoyment to be had, then ploughing on with them anyway. But it's predominantly a superficial experience of colour, pop culture and violence, with everything presented to excess. There is no strong emotional pull, but as the journey is such dark, exhilarating fun this matters little. Both ‘Kick-Ass’ and Dave Lizewski have the confidence and ambition to try something new – one more successfully than the other – and the effort alone would have been admirable, but the film is executed with such cohesion and spirit it deserves to be elevated over many of the movies from which it derives.

The Road is a post-apocalyptic story based on a 2006 book, if interesting and engrossing. Initially the film jumps in manner that for someone unaware of the story I believe would be disconcerting, though it soon hits its stride. The story walks the line between too little information for the viewer and too much expanation masterfully, with the father-son scenes that make up the bulk of the film expanding not just their relationship but the world in which they live. The pacing is solid and despite being an old cynic I found myself genuinely caring for the characters.

The Road is a refreshing change, a statement complemented by the film's palette. This is a story of normal people in exceptional circumstances and all the more powerful for it.

Aside from Viggo Mortensen's powerful presence on screen I would have to give a special mention to the cinematography which truly evokes a feeling of desperation and hopelessness that sets the scene perfectly for the drama that unfolds.

1370173949.0,1fik1a,IJW: Das Boot (1981),Girlwithnousername,17,1,23,"Das Boot (‘The Boat’) is a tale of life and war on a German submarine

The first third of the film focuses on building up a picture of life on a U-boat for the viewer; the repetitive nature of day-to-day life, scrutinise every movement, and in a revolting display of shipmanly knowledge, on one occasion diagnose that a man’s genital crabs have reached his eyebrows at the dinner table (‘that’s stage five’) – shudder.

So you get the picture. It’s very slow moving, and there is some extensive character development along the way, so you can’t really skip it.

When the action begins to take off, well, my mind boggled imagining how they managed to achieve such amazingly realistic cinematography way back then. A quick read of Wiki tells me that it had budget of 32 million DM ($18.5 million), and was the second most expensive German film production to date upon its release. So that solves that puzzle. 

You are left in no doubt as to what it feels like to be on a U-boat which is being attacked, break into cold sweats and become increasingly panicked as they start to submerge from 180 to 220 feet and can barely breathe. 

Similarly the scenes involving enemy craft and bombings are equally realistic. I won’t spoil the plot by going into detail

At 3 hours 19 minutes, but I am told the actors dubbed their own voices, so that’s an irritant you’ll just have to cope with. You can also find the German version with subtitles which I intend to look up; I suspect I may prefer to watch it in German. For the really brave, I’m told the Directors’ Cut is 4 hours long. Bear in mind that it may be a struggle to get through the first third but that it serves a purpose, and I hope you will really enjoy this film.

I began watching this not entirely sure what to expect from it and whether you read up on it or not probably makes no difference as Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain is such an eccentric and unique piece of film-making that it's impossible to describe properly. It demands to be seen, the true triumph of The Holy Mountain is that there actually is a point to what is happening on screen. The problem I've always had with non-sense type Dadaism is exactly that, it's simply non-sense, but despite its surreal, utterly grotesque qualities this film is actually about something. Its political and anti-consumerist themes are put in the foreground, giving what at first glance seems like pure claptrap an air of intelligence.

The reason I enjoyed this as much as I did is that it is genuinely witty, it is actually very impressive in its production with a number of odd set-pieces and a plethora of weird props and costumes that keep up interest at all times. The Holy Mountain is an instance of mad, completely bananas film-making that manages to keep just enough coherence to be an engrossing and enlightening experience. Jodorowsky didn't just brainstorm for things that he thinks look cool or shock the Average Joe, he made a point with this film and made it clearly enough to be picked up by just about anyone, while keeping a feeling of mystery and secrecy.

I'm frankly shocked that this turned out to be as entertaining and interesting as it is and will now gladly add myself to the long list of Jodorowsky-followers.

Exploitation cinema has had a rough ride in recent years – trashy examples from the 70s and 80s are often considered kitsch masterpieces, a cast of former clean-cut teen stars (Hudgens and Gomez were both Disney girls), an A-list leading man and an art-house aesthetic and structure. 

Not driven by narrative or character, guns, drugs and teen angst than a 16-year-old's Tumblr feed.

Chopping back and forth in time, and as funny, sexy, and sleazy as it needs to be to hold the attention. Much of this is down to Franco, who is fantastic as the bizarre, manic Alien – nailing all the movie’s best lines and creating a character who will surely pass into cult status. 

Shot with the leering eye of porn and pop videos, paralleled with Florida’s dingy underworld, the colours linger in the memory far longer than the film itself. The construction works fantastically well, capturing the raw energy of youth – perhaps a comment on pop culture and our consumption of content in short bursts, but you’d have to really want to see it. That being said, Alien showing the girls round his house exclaiming “LOOK AT MY SHIT! LOOK AT ALL MY SHIT” certainly says something about our material culture and compulsion to ‘share’, and the our skewed idea of ‘making it’. There are also some well-observed truths about female friendship and adolescence – the recurring theme of wanting to stay locked in a moment of youth is something we can all relate to; as is the sense of invincibility every teenager feels

Ultimately it’s a hugely enjoyable slice of filth that passingly works as a superficial satire of youth culture. With no real depth, frantic ride delivers more than enough entertainment – but leaves an urge to have a good shower afterwards.

Goes without saying if you cannot stand found footage or film anthologies, so this series has always gotten a pass from me. The original was far from perfect, but the found footage shorts prevent you from being bored with any one particular concept for very long. Before you know it, it's on the next tale... and again, much like the first film: none of the shorts are terrible and one or two stand out -which is what makes an anthology good. 

I'll do my best not to spoil anything below because I really like this series and I think many horror fans would enjoy it. 
Each short really kept my attention. Some started out as decent concepts that ended being pretty cliche. One particular zombie short I thought was not very clever

The stand out short is the one about the cult. Gareth Evans (director of The Raid: Redemption!) is certainly someone to keep an eye out for. It's not perfect, it explodes into a bloody mess! I loved it and I was totally hooked!

In the realm of superheroes Wolverine is one of the most humanly interesting, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a broken man living alone in the American wilderness – when he is unexpectedly visited by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) and cajoled into journeying to Japan to bid farewell to Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), an elderly influential businessman whose life he saved during the Second World War. But Yashida’s ulterior motives, and a violent power struggle within the family, force Logan to become more entwined in these strangers’ lives than he imagined – driving him closer to Yashida’s granddaughter, the equally conflicted Mariko (Tao Okamoto).

In taking a more reflective approach to the genre this feels like a smaller, but plenty of touching moments intertwined with Japanese culture and mythology demonstrate there is at least something intellectual taking place. 

This doesn’t have the big-budget gloss and finesse of the average summer blockbuster, and refreshingly show him getting hurt and actually requiring time to recover instead of dusting himself off and springing back to action. A small detail but it adds weight to the action, and a palpable sense of threat. 

‘The Wolverine’ is an admirable attempt to use a multi-million dollar blockbuster as a character study, but as the overblown climax draws to a close and you think back on the strength of its earlier movements it’s hard not to feel slightly dissatisfied.

Firstly, but the next bombastic piece of action is never too far away. The vast zombie hordes suffer from slightly ropey CGI but they’re undeniably impressive, and all the close combat is handled with some excellent special effects and gripping tension. A pounding Hollywood score helps to keep excitement levels up when much of what’s happening isn’t particularly emotionally involving.

This is less a zombie flick than a classic Hollywood disaster movie – an A-list star charged with inexplicably saving the day alone, but it’s part and parcel of the genre, so with a little suspension of disbelief it’s still entertaining enough. Pitt is solid in what is an incredibly two-dimensional role, adding at least some weight to the part, but this isn’t really a film about character – it’s all about the spectacle. Although derivative and uninvolving there’s some decent nonsensical disposable fun to be had, but that’s about it.

So, but less so once I heard it was being stretched to three films. This first part has many of the right pieces - an excellent cast with great performances, the same incredibly realised Middle Earth from the LotR films - but they're put together all wrong.

It is far, most especially:

* The encounter with the trolls plays out completely differently to the book, etc).
* The escape from the goblins was utter, breaking the point at which they noticed Bilbo was missing.
* The bit with the wolves and the trees was again completely different

I spent the entire film oscillating between eye-rolling irritation and eye-rolling boredom. I'm just disappointed that with the ingredients available, why make The Hobbit at all?

I guess I'm being hypocritical. I quite liked the LotR films largely because I never really got on with the books. Purists were endlessly irritated by the changes

The Hobbit is a book I absolutely love, rather than ponderous and portentous like LotR. Given my attachment to the book, and that these changes are *expansions* to drag it out to 3 films (and thus totally unnecessary artistically), I am far, far less forgiving.

The Asylum is a studio that focuses on ripping off popular blockbusters with a microscopic budget and the production value of a High School project, as well as somehow persuading a bunch of well-known actors to work with them, Shark Tale would be the type of product I'd imagine these people to shit out after seeing how successful Pixar's Finding Nemo was. It's a soulless, cynical, completely unfunny and inconceivably awful piece of shit that not only doesn't satisfy as an animated film on any level, it has the guts to invoke cinema classics in its pitiful attempts at humour, making it above all these things an offensive and soul-crushing experience

Whereas The Asylum is entirely aware of their cheap knock-offs being complete crap, who I hope to god got handsomely paid for essentially selling their souls to the devil, are rather pleased with their “effort”. Financially, this did rather well and succeeded in bringing in a lot of cash from its poor audiences, but while the majority of people unfortunate enough to have sat through it will probably brush its awfulness off rather swiftly, everyone involved in Shark Tale has to wake up everyday knowing they've made the absolute worst animated film to ever come out of a big studio. It isn't just a dumb, annoying and ugly film (it is all of those things), and how reassuring to know that since release this has slowly and deservedly been forgotten

The animation is ugly as sin, and the entire time I was watching this inexcusable pile of corporate vomit the only thing I could ever think about was: Why Marty?

According to Steve Martin himself the best movie he ever starred in and a statement I whole-heartedly agree with. Planes, jolly fellow is golden and despite similar scenarios having been done to death in the past still works perfectly after 25 years. The two put on their A-game and make warming to the wonderfully written characters even easier, their slowly building bromance being the driving force of the film. It's hard to look at the same film with a different cast as the chemistry is what makes Planes, Trains and Automobiles so hilarious and pleasing to watch.

As with every great comedy what really makes it work so well and also what keeps it so charming and heart-warming are the characters. A problem I have with most comedies, luckily, Hughes was more than aware of this. It's evident in his other John Candy collaboration, Uncle Buck, that he truly understood what makes a great comedy and in that regard PTaA is easily his most accomplished. Sure, it's very funny and occasionally even resorts to foul-mouthing (one of the best parts of the film involves Steve Martin yelling at a clerk), but gags never come before the two main characters and their relationship. The outcome may sound clichéd on paper but after the incredible journey just witnessed the ending is easily bought into, witty and moving. Planes

This movie just came out

Let me just say that I enjoyed the movie. That's beyond the point though. To say I enjoy most films is an understatement. I generally can find enjoyment in all films, but come on. 

Let it be heard that I don't like lengthy exposition. Hasn't worked for me much since shawshank. I think that it is a poor poor way to convey a lot of the subtext of the film

I like Guy Pearce. I love Ben Kingsley. I practically creamed my pants when they showed Mark Ruffalo in the AC scene. 

Let's look at this movie how you have to look at derivative films

* As a standalone. It was enjoyable. I'm not sure it will ever be anything more. It was a film that tried to be serious and funny. It didn't work for me. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER When we find out Killian is the mandarin

* As a faithful comic book film I have absolutely no idea. I have not read any iron man. I knew the Mandarin was a main villain in the series I have no idea if they executed it well.

* How it fits in the franchise. Definitely better than 2

I probably should've seen this a long time ago but it wouldn't matter too much as this film apparently forgot to age and even in 2013 is a fascinating piece of cinema. Featuring meticulous set and costume design, although it's definitely partly about the sheer sense of scale, it has a lot more to offer than the ape costume. Like with most great Sci-Fi it transports the audience to a world that may share similarities with ours but is at its core distinctly different and alienating. The world of the apes is so strange it sometimes comes off as comedic or even campy but it actually feels rather authentic. It's an impressive feat and every frame makes you aware of the amount of work that went into it.

On a technical level it is very accomplished and completely deserves its accolades, however, are the apes themselves, who have much more to offer than their frankly brilliantly realized appearance. While on the surface an entertaining adventure/sci-fi flick it also works on a level of societal commentary and critique thereof. Culminating in the ending (which everyone knows and weirdly enough is spoiled on the poster) it constantly questions mankind in a fairly blunt but pleasing manner.

Planet of the Apes is one of two highly important Sci-Fi films to come out in 1968 and its impact can be felt even today. Don't miss out on this one.

Overall, there were many characters that were introduced without any sort of backstory, such as the return of Storm Shadow and Jinx. They acknowledge Destro, but don't even include him in the movie at all

As for the good, thus delaying the film's release from last summer. [Then kill off his character within the first 30 minutes of the film. Baffles my mind. Flint was given a big part but doesn't even do much. No clue as to why Channing Tatum didn't get that part instead](/spoiler) Bruce Willis was given a minor role with minimal dialogue, but nails it I thought.

Well

I say it's revolting because some of the things you view

Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña are LAPD cops and they seem to get the lion's share of being called out to some really crappy situations with some entirely unpleasant individuals; we do see a drunk guy who had been terrorising the post man (!)

Other than the post guy there's a series of some of the worst out there in terms of crack addicts, certainly at least one character stood out to me as in a similar vein. Not seen the scene? It’s worth the price of a dvd alone. There’s part of it on the trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSVRGdHFxYc. 
 
It’s not just a shoot-em-up and arrest them film though; there’s a lot of focus on the close relationship Brian and Mike have fostered through working together; they are ‘brothers’, a lot of swearing and calling one another names, warmth and care displayed. But this is not a film about the lives of two cops: make no mistake, the violence is brutal. 

The film is shot with the appearance of handheld cameras; sometimes I think this works and sometimes I’m not totally sold on it; but the scene I most thought it would NOT work on (most people would be able to predict what’s about to happen in this scene)

I found that towards the end I started to tire of it; it started to feel so formulaic that I began to become irritated and just wanted it over with

The acting is of a good standard all-round

I was surprised that it was set in LA; I thought LA was all rose petals being scattered in front of your path as you walk

**Recommend. 8.5 out of 10 for me.**  The following spoilers are why it loses 1.5 points; one’s a massive spoiler so really don’t read if you haven’t seen the film please. 

[I found it difficult to warm to any of the characters we were meant to warm too; perhaps I was just in a particularly cold-hearted mood

[Probably because of the above

[I love that I had convinced myself that it was bloody daft that the cartel had killed Brian and just left Mike there untouched; this was a 'hit'

[The last minute or two with them chatting and laughing in the car was a nice touch too.](/spoiler)

And was that Queens Of The Stone Age I heard at the end? A quick Google tells me not

Holy fuck this was a great movie. When I started watching it

The first few minutes started off very slow

It was great to see how the simple men of Scotland could fight against the English so strongly and ferociously. The Battle of Stirling was both hilarious and very moving. William's speech was well delivered and awesome. The middle parts of the movie were all interesting

I saw the trap coming and was nearly shouting at the scren in Ackbar's voice ""IT'S A TRAP!"" The romance between the princess (Isabelle?) was alright. It felt more forced and one-sided than William and Murron's Romeo and Juliet-esque story.

The death scene was one of the highlights. I'm not sure what part to highlight because I felt so many conflicting emotions. The very ending scene was quite pleasing and was a satisfying conclusion.

Things I liked the most/noticed some:

* The story is very very well done
* I've never been a good judge of acting
* Action sequences well-done
* Very nice ""mood"" -&gt; sense of dread
* Incredibly satisfying to watch. Not sure how to further describe this feeling. It felt like watching the LOTR for the first time... but a bit less awesome
* Camera work had nothing special
* Character development was a huge highlight. Seeing William grow up from a boy to an enraged warrior was great.

That a lot of the movie is fueled by the racist views of many different cultures makes it even more impressive.

One of the greatest scenes is when the Dominican man, Coconut, reflects on the Korean market owner. But there are many conversations like this, beautifully scripted dialogue that furthers the story each time words come out of the character's mouths.

I don't want to rant too long because I could write pages on Do The Right Thing. It's one of the greatest social commentaries I've ever seen from a film.

Nevertheless

I wasn't surprised. But I can't say that made me happy.

The new ED goes off the tracks right from the start. In the original movie the kids visiting the cabin accidentally played a tape recording of the words that summoned the titular evil. In the remake some dumb kid ignores countless warnings written all over the mysterious flesh-covered book he finds and decides to read the friggin cursed words aloud....for fun? But none of it is really that fun. It certainly doesn't live up to the madcap legacy of the original Raimi films

The remake tries to stay true to a few of the famous scenes from the originals

My girlfriend kept telling me to stop comparing this ED to the originals but I was not able to do that. I don't like the changes they made in this remake. They sucked all the joy right out of the movie. The remake has gore and might please kids the age I was when I first saw the original ED,,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,True

I also found that the scenes at the end where [you find out his wife cheated on him with his sponsor](/spoiler) and [his old boss tells him he probably could have gotten his job back](/spoiler) were overkill.

I liked the style; the interviews interspersed in the film gave it a documentary feel. The acting was very well done, God-fearing Christian man who was pushed too far. I felt sorry for him the whole way through. Matthew McConaughey was very entertaining as the charismatic District Attorney who prosecuted Bernie.

I really liked the theme of the move. Anyone, even in the face of the evidence against him. It shows how much people are willing to ignore someone's dirty laundry and focus on what good things they have done.

Slow-paced, responsible for jumpstarting a whole wave of American independent films in the late 80s and early 90s, to which he contributed many more, is narratively and visually simplistic but much smarter than it seems at first glance. What easily comes off as way too off-beat and shallow eventually develops into something very interesting and thought-provoking. Although plot-wise not much happens and one may even call it boring, it consistently pleases with bucket loads of deadpan humour, which makes the laboriously slow movement of the story not just bearable but actually very enjoyable.

It's clear that Jarmusch was still trying to find his voice with this as it's very rough around the edges, and its many oddities play a big part in conveying that. Loneliness, aimlessness, and profound boredom with the world around them, the characters go on a trip in an attempt to find excitement in their monotonous lives, only to find even more uneventful boredom wherever they go with the scenery being the only thing that changes.

&lt;i&gt;Stranger than Paradise&lt;/i&gt;, as well as being much more entertaining than a lot of people give it credit for.

I seriously just exited Netflix. I didn't really know what to expect before watching this. All I knew of this film was that it was directed by Gaspar Noé and had tons of neon lights. The drug effects were incredible, well, life. It's shot mostly from the perspective of Oscar, either from his first person POV or from just behind his shoulders. There was an excellent scene (sequence of scenes?) where we follow him through his childhood. We are always behind him, watching from his perspective, as he grows. He really doesn't move much in the frame either, always just off center and standing at the same angle as the camera.

Had the chance to check this out tonight after a friend recommended it a while ago. At only 77 minutes, but as the film progressed I began to piece together what was all happening. The concept it follows is quite far fetched, but the idea of it is phenomenal. Time machines, body doubles, and evading causality paradoxes all play a big role in this film making it quite an interesting watch. The last ten minutes of the film give the viewer a rundown of everything that's occurred, the repercussions of their actions and what's to come. This debunked my original theory of what I thought was going on and left me in confusion. Definitely need to re-watch this one.

Guy Ritchie’s rollicking gangster caper with half the London underworld chasing the same money, Mark Strong, Thandie Newton, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy and Toby Kebbell. A Russian billionaire, his beautiful accountant, a top mob boss, no one safe from being scammed or ripped off

Despite imperfections, individually the sections work well. The script is full of Ritchie's trademark mockney wit and is painfully self-aware but nevertheless delivers enough quotable lines and big laughs. It's testament to the quality of the dialogue that the film is engrossing despite the flat characters and baffling plot - every time it begins to drag someone nails a line and gets you back on side. Unfortunately there are a few stabs at moralising and spirituality that are cringeworthy in their pretentiousness – and have no place in something as lightweight as this.

The ensemble cast is so strong the film is able to get away with far more than it should. Butler, and although derivative everything is well handled in a brash meaty style that runs throughout. Some of the action scenes are particularly inventive, and seeing Butler, Elba and Hardy take on Ukrainian mercenaries in a sports shop is worth the price of admission alone. The over-the-top style extends to the soundtrack - ballsy blues and rock swagger over every set piece.

Captivating from the first scene to the last, revealing little about its characters or their lives and commenting on the global pharmaceutical industry without taking an explicit stance, it offers most of its pleasures through the absorbing narrative and wild unpredictability. The audience share an intense journey with Jonathan as he is pulled apart by speculation and obsession, the twists and turns of which are beautifully concealed. Here is one of cinema’s greatest pleasures - the feeling that absolutely anything can happen. In one way or another most films are formulaic: it’s refreshing to see a successful mainstream picture that leaves us uncertain of the ground beneath our feet. This is a thriller that defies convention, outlandish and sexually charged – delivering far more than it initially promises.

All of the cast are exceptional, a large degree of attachment has already been established.

Also, it kind of led to Spider-Man being a vengeful vigilante for a while. A point that was lightly glossed over. Just a reference by Leary's character then the bridge scene.

It's one of those movies where I just sat there through the credits, of how I felt after my first kiss, but that was a product of chemical imbalance and a lifetime of building something up out of proportion.

Maybe that's what this is; watching that movie felt weirdly real. Two people; one, awkward boy with curly brown hair and big eyes (ugh my weakness incarnate), the other, Anna, a beautiful, quirky girl with skinny legs and messy hair. They fall in love in a sweet, unusual way, and they go on a first date that lasts hours and ends with them touching hands through a glass door and having the most intimate eye-sex of any movie I've seen recently. Quiet scenes and a slightly shaky camera. Faults and flaws not completely covered up. It's a sort of voyeuristic experience, real love

Stuff happens, they decide to end things. Jacob is at his home, and you see his new girlfriend, and it's Jennifer Goddamn Lawrence.

Now I'm confused. I'm so confused. Jacob and Samantha have an easy, as if he can't help it. He goes to England and there's no magic. They still seem to be in love, but there's something missing. The actual love, I don't know. But I accept it as love. And I'm starting to become upset by this movie.

They get married and apply for a marriage visa. Turns out that doesn't do anything about her student visa ban. They have a tense moment at a fair and walk home, and she returns to Simon, her neighbor that she slept with.

It seems right

Jacob and Anna meet at the airport and it's awkward. They're in love. They love each other. But it's a sad love. The last scene is them showering together, and it's depressing. Is that love? Does it happen, intense and amazing, and then as it fades you try to find it elsewhere but you never do, and all that's left is finding the person who once made you feel that way, and hoping you can remember what love felt like? They fought to be together, but why? Because you don't give up on love? When do you admit that it just isn't worth it?

So, separate again, and finally end up together. But it's the worst happy ending I've ever seen.

It feels like after my first kiss. This amazing, and it's not that special. Maybe there is no true love, just the rush of early infatuation and the desperate need to hold on to that person forever.

Based on Hunter Thompson's book of the same name

This was directed by Terry Gilliam and him he usually makes movies that are very strange. This is definitely no exception. There really isn't a clear plot to this movie. It starts off with the characters going to report on the race and then becomes what feels like a series of drug-induced anecdotes and experiences that occur around the same time. I did like how it was like a stream of consciousness (drug-induced consciousness) and, I wasn't sure whether what I was seeing was real or a hallucination. Depp was convincing as the journalist Raoul Duke (who represents Hunter Thompson himself) and Del Toro was pretty damn scary playing Mr. Gonzo, the volatile lawyer who always carries a knife or a gun.

For a while, I was writing movie reviews on IMDB. I hadn't seen this movie before today and I haven't done a review in quite a while. As luck would have it, I just stumbled on this subreddit and this hasn't been reviewed yet. So, here it goes!

*Sideways* centers around Miles (Paul Giamatti), a washed up but still semi-successful actor. Jack is about to get married, so Miles plans to send him off with a bang in California wine country.

I feel like *The Hangover* series is a more juvenile version of this film. It's basically two hours of the characters getting drunk and making bad decisions and then having to work to resolve the problems they've made, they're drinking lots and lots of wine. And, at times, it's actually pretty funny because it's not just dick and fart jokes!

A major theme in this movie is acceptance. Characters make TERRIBLE decisions and other characters must chose how to react to these decisions. Another more underlying theme is a lack of completion. When is something actually complete? When *should* something be complete? 

I really liked the acting in this film. Giamatti plays the perfect loser and you truly feel bad for the guy. Hayden Church, and you'll either love him or hate him. Even though they're both great and they have great chemistry, I kept wondering what it would have been like if Jeff Bridges landed the role instead. I feel like he would have done a better job.

I thought this movie would be about a couple of guys my dad's age getting too drunk and getting into shenanigans. It's actually about way more than that. Yeah

*Brazil* is a film about an office worker in a dystopian future whose assignment to correct an error eventually leads him to finding the woman of his dreams and becoming an enemy of the state.

This film, steampunk technology, and....air ducts....is both confusing and interesting. It satirizes bureaucratic society and our ability to ignore problems as long as we're comfortable. The scene in the restaurant at the beginning is absolutely hilarious. The characters themselves are over-the-top and funny, especially Robert DeNiro as the rogue air conditioner repairman.

The story is pretty good, but trust him so quickly. It's a weird romance, but it is a Terry Gilliam film so weird is expected. The ending was amazing, though and had me saying ""what the fuck"" every few seconds.

1371139793.0,1g9wq5,IJW: Psycho (1960),ben_smith_123,12,1,2,"Hitchcock’s unbearably tense, cash-strapped boyfriend. During the drive from Phoenix to his home in California she encounters a policeman who eyes her with suspicion and begins to follow her. Disorientated and distressed during a fierce stormy night she pulls into the entirely vacant Bates motel to spend the night. The genial but peculiar Norman (Anthony Perkins) who runs the motel and cares for his invalid mother alone welcomes her in and cooks her dinner

Beginning under the guise of a crime thriller it’s the film’s unpredictability that draws you into its dark world – and is never less than thoroughly absorbing. The mystery of the odd motel is the real compulsion, spending a large portion of her screen time silently alone in the car, with trepidation writ large across her face. Perkins' mix of affability and mania is equally impressive, fuelling our ever-growing sense of unease. The acting has the slightly pinched feeling of old cinema, but it unquestionably retains some naturalism and humanity.

Much of Psycho's power lies in the music, and is capable of eliciting a great visceral dread. The script is as sharp and succinct as the title with not a word wasted. Flashes of black humour and dialogue bordering on the profound really capture something about sin, loneliness and regret. 

Every frame is so well constructed and beautiful that ‘Psycho’ can never really age, tight crops and haunting establishing shots would look flawless in any time period. Clearly produced on a small scale, the inventive, ambitious approach to the cinematography adds an enhanced degree of value and it’s easy to see why it has passed into cinema legend.

How Mackendrick's hilarious dark comedy managed to fade into relative obscurity over the years is baffling to me. The Ladykillers is a true gem in the genre and easily one of the funniest films of all time with its unique table of characters, oblivious to the fact that she is renting a room to the mastermind behind a heist, is brilliantly funny and perfectly cast. It's impossible to think of anyone else playing that part, although weirdly enough she wasn't initially meant to be cast and only got the role after the woman given the role first died before filming. As tragic as that is, the film benefited hugely from this, as she nails both the comedic aspects as well as the human aspects. It's easy to warm to her character, which is especially important for the second half of the film to work at all.

Rounding up the Ladykillers is an all-star cast consisting of the likes of Alec Guinness and a young Peter Sellers, the old lady's antics hilarious, and the slapstick excellently choreographed. Mackendrick's use of the claustrophobic set creates a strange atmosphere, mixing the light humour with some dark undertones. The set is like out of a bad dream, complete with strange colour contrasts, awkward angles and narrow, suffocating hallways. It's such a peculiar house where everything takes place and allows to be constantly interesting visually

The Ladykillers is really hard to fault in any area

**9 / 10**

I enjoyed it.  Lots of action (car chases in the 1st, rather than the previous series staple of ""2nd act is boring because we save all of our car chases for the beginning and end).  A decent plot that ties this latest film to the events of the previous films (leads from Brian's cop past, ""The Rock""'s character from Brazil, and an explanation for some of the still-unresolved questions from Fast 4, all make an appearance).  The post-ending (not really post-credits) scene is very nice.  There are some flaws in the in-movie logic, and as seems to be par for the course with this franchise, the main villain isn't really a good villain.

Michael Mann’s romanticised historical epic may have been released in 1993 but it has all the hallmarks of classic matinee storytelling, and with a growing affection for one of the rescued girls, Cora (Madeleine Stowe), Hawkeye and his family are drawn deeper into the conflict.

Refreshingly uncomplicated and hugely entertaining throughout, rises and falls beautifully lending a warm nostalgic feeling. The music is almost as monumental as the performances. There is nothing subtle about this film: big emotions playing out in even bigger landscapes. Undeniably inflated and overblown, this is the very secret of the film's success. From the first reel it's a black and white tale of heroes and villains, and the power of pure hearts to conquer all. Never attempting to be anything darker or more complex, it chooses sentimentality over historical accuracy and is all the better for it. This is the kind of film that can be relaxed into. We all know where we’re generally heading - sit back and enjoy the spectacle.

Although predictable, a real ‘leading man’ performance in the oldest traditions of Hollywood.

Essentially a well-executed melodrama with some added bloodshed and a rousing musical score

—

Generic motor-racing blockbuster from Tony Scott about the exceptionally named Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise), crossing paths off and on the track. Falling for his beautiful nurse Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), haunted by personal demons and consumed by the need to win, Cole struggles to keep his focus on driving.

As simplistic as the title and synopsis suggests

NASCAR is a fairly tedious sport consisting entirely of stock cars lapping an oval circuit for little short of eternity – so it’s credit to Tony Scott that the race scenes are thrilling and far more gripping than the sport itself. Presenting an idealised vision of motor sport, it plays out like a patchwork of what ‘needs’ to happen in an underdog flick. Unfortunately, a collection of all the right components doesn’t guarantee a well-constructed piece of storytelling and ‘Days of Thunder’ disjointedly chops around from one scene to the next. 

Tom Cruise adds a touch of star quality but when the script is 50% “goddammit!” and “sonofabitch!” there isn’t really much to be done with the role. But it’s through its cliches and familiarity that the film provides its pleasures – far from groaning at borrowed scenes and stilted dialogue they are so broadly signposted and deliberate you feel like doing a little Tim Henman fist-pump as it works its way through them. Claiming a film is ‘so bad it’s good’ is a huge copout that does a disservice to many pictures – there are positives in every film

Originally posted (by me) here: http://www.zimbio.com/Zimbio+Film+Reviews/articles/BxTIoeLP31M/Lovelace+Turns+Porn+Star+Person

Linda Boreman aka Linda Lovelace basically had one trick that made her the star of the most profitable and popular porn movie of all time. And the objectified Deep Throat version of Linda Lovelace instantly and unnervingly subsumed the real person inside in a way nothing could have prepared her for.

Lovelace is the story of how she tried very hard, and lacking the nuance of a really great picture, but Lovelace successfully jolts its audience into seeing its subject as a person. This is the film's greatest merit, and it's achieved through dogged monomania. Any subtleties in the story, like Linda Lovelace's real-life return to modeling or the complexities of the people around her, are sacrificed in the name of delivering one message: Linda Lovelace was a person. 

The central narrative conceit of Lovelace is that you get the story twice. The first time you get the glammed up version of events: the lights

Yes you can feel the ham-handed symbolism in the structure (two sides to the coin

Seyfried's not the only one keeping it interesting, is written as a sort of melodramatic caricature, but Peter Sarsgaard's special gift for playing creeps keeps the audience off balance. The supporting cast is one big exercise in stunt casting, but I can't help but love seeing Adam Brody as Linda's super nice-guy co-star; or Bobby Cannavale, who so expertly terrorized everyone in Boardwalk Empire last season, playing the mafia-connected porn producer. As Linda's mom, Sharon Stone ratchets up the tension in every scene she's in even if her character isn't given any room to grow. 

A lot of comparisons are going to be made between Lovelace and Boogie Nights mostly because they're both about porn and they're both set in the 1970s. But beyond those two superficial traits

Lovelace does get you to see its subject at a person, and it feels like a conversation worth having.

Living in South Korea has a few advantages.

I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it

""In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off most life on the planet

Like a lot of Korean cinema that garners interest in the West, and rarely stops for a comedic moment. It also moves fast, setting up the premise before the title credits even finish, and constantly pushes ahead with the plot as the characters move forward on the train.

Like director Joon-ho Bong's most famous film, although in *Snowpiercer* they are not all blood relatives. They are backed by a seemingly endless supply of nameless supporters, who comprise the cannon fodder during action scenes. The large number of these individuals is part of Joon-ho's interest in portraying social issues through genre fiction. Although the main character and his supporters are the largest group on the train, they are also the lowest class, bullied by a police force owned by the first class passengers. 

The class struggle aspects of the film make it more than a simple thriller, it does elongate its scenes from time to time. There's no single part that could have been cut, but a bit of trimming here and there could have pared the film down a bit from its 125 minute runtime.

These are minor grievances for a film that combines two of the largest issues facing society - ecological collapse and classism - in a way that is thrilling and never preachy. All of the actor's turn in excellent performances of the caliber expected by the likes of Tilda Swindon, while Chris Evans handles himself well in a role much more serious than that of Cap 'Murica. 

While it isn't Oscar bait, Joon-ho ensures the film remains memorable after viewing. That in itself is notable for a movie with so many axe fights.

So

Now, novel, and interesting. 

Again, but also mildly disturbed as unlike Hunger Games, Pacific Rim didn't do anything beyond lifting SOOO many thematic elements from NGE and christ, I think I saw the same designs from both SC and NGE. It was like someone  was in charge of copying NGE and grabbing the soundtrack to Starcraft and mashed them into one giant blob that doesn't do anything.


[The worst thing was

What the movie lacked was surprise and driving action based on an EMOTIONAL or DRAMATIC arc

Instead we are treated to a presentation as childish as Round 1

ON a personal note, where the construction would begin (sort of a nod to Gunbuster, i.e. robots amongst giant fields of grain)... and then about 5 years later, Pacific Rim is announced. I was hopeful. I was so let down. Movie making fundamentals ruined.


Here are some identifiable *attempted* thematic elements that I noticed as either nods or lifts :

1. Gunbuster Noriko / Coach relationship between Mako and the commanding officer Idris Elba (the black guy). 
2. Interface Synchronization : NGE
3. Pilots in Giant Mecha doing virtual movement with choregraphed ""buster shot"" / rocket elbow
4. Music : Starcraft 1 and 2 inspired marine-side music
5. series of Ambiguous but uniquely individualized monsters with specific behaviours and attacks: NGE 
6. Team Russia  / Team China / Team etc... Gunbuster

Hello all
I saw that someone reviewed this a while ago

I went into this movie being an Emmerich fan (my dad and I have probably watched Independence day 15+ times together and my entire family loves to watch The Day After Tomorrow occasionally and I like most of his other films) and knowing exactly what I was getting into: an over the top action movie with an overt political message that ends happily. Boy did this deliver and then some.

So the movie starts out like it does in the trailer. Channing, played by the girl from Moneyball, and generally get his life back on track. So part Rambo, part stereotypical divorcee, all around American. I loved it and the opening wasn't as boring as I expected and kept me interested as it switched perspectives and blatantly foreshadowed. Also, Maggie G. is looking summertime fine (second only to her role in Secretary). Everyone else fit their role and the acting was pretty good.

From here on out it's spoiler territory, as well as a lot of tension, which was balanced nicely. There were about 4-5 twists in the movie, which I saw coming a mile away, but it didn't detract from the film. And I normally don't like kids in action movies, but the daughter's scenes were actually very enjoyable and added a lot to the progression of the movie. Also, almost everything gets blown up

I don't like to give movies an arbitrary number score because my 10 and your 10 are completely different

It was also quite nice to have an end-of-the-world movie that doesn't concentrate on overly-muscular males attempting to subvert the universe's impending doom, while everyone else runs around disobeying laws left, right, and centre because the consequences won't matter. At the heart of it, this movie depicts what the everyman would do at the end of the world.

As the end of the world is quite a delicate matter, complimenting the down-to-earth nature of the movie as a whole.

In essence, I recommend Seeking A Friend for the End of the World. Kiera Knightley and Steve Carrell work well together, even if some of the writing does let them down at points, but the film is rather beautiful nonetheless.

I had read an interview with M. Fassbender in GQ about a year and a half ago. I think he's an incredibly talented actor (his David in Prometheus is just fantastic, which is shown several times in the film (and not THAT giant) - so I suppose the pompousness is almost unavoidable at some point.

Basically, no doubt, but it wasn't enough to carry the film. 

Fassbender's Brandon is absolutely deplorable. The only driving force in his life is sex. Every emotion he pretends to feel is merely an attempt to have sex. Anger, well. There's the thing. He doesn't feel joy. Or happiness. Even the girl he seems to actually, possibly like - is simply an attempt to recreate a sex act he saw earlier, and wanted to engage in. He is a sad, depraved man, created by what we assume is a terrible childhood. And Fassbender pulls this all off brilliantly. 

The problems arise, Sissy, is lackluster, and while her character is more sympathetic than Brandon's - Mulligan's weak performance fails to help us feel that.

Much like Iron Man, it’s a funny, knockabout, colourful romp loaded with action, but it has a soul. Also surprising is that, though following a core narrative thread, it splits off in unexpected tangents along the way. It would’ve worked as a simple A to B plot

The film is directed and co-written by Shane Black – the scriptwriter behind Lethal Weapon 1-2 – who has a unique skill for throwaway wisecracks and buddy chemistry, capturing something of a comic book’s tone, but most importantly they’re genuinely funny. This owes much to Downey Jr’s relaxed, delayed delivery – a man who was born for the role. He IS Tony Stark - cheeky quips, ego, troubled past and all – and turns in an immaculate performance as the billionaire with humour and swagger, but also touching flashes of humility as Tony stares into the abyss.

Seriously

The story follows a man named Sam Lowry; your average guy with an overbearing mother and no motivation to move up the career ladder of the state beurocracy. But all this changes when he meets the literal girl of his dreams (the film is cut up with dream sequences that depict Sam as an heroic figure trying to save this girl). We're taken through a world of beurocratic incompetence that's justified by the threat of 'terrorists' as Sam attempts to connect with this woman. The story is simple enough but Terry Gilliam's capacity to tell it and make it visually staggering are definitely proven with Brazil. It's not CG but the practical effects get the job done and provide some of the most interesting and original visuals I've ever seen.

A mere synopsis goes no way to describing the depth and ambition of this film. A study of tyranny and evil demonstrated in an unflinchingly brutal drama and presented in a wildly imaginative alternate reality, the cavernous sets have a strong feeling of the stage – heightened by the eccentric costumes (designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, no less) that fall somewhere between 70’s London, Elizabethan England and the distant future. It may sound incredibly superficial but writer/director Peter Greenaway has delivered enough weight to ensure the style doesn’t overawe the subject. Released in 1988 it can be read as a satire on Thatcher’s Britain, or a broader portrait of oppression and the power of evil – the interpretation is left to the audience. Predominantly playing as a domestic drama about lust and abuse, it is so well written and performed it can be enjoyed as such - the depth is there for those who wish to see it. 

Michael Gambon is electric as the bigoted, initially a far quieter performance, is no less impressive, making the remarkable transformation from meek wife to sexual, hard edged woman filled with carnal desire and hate. Both roles are delivered with such solid conviction and boldness it is impossible not to be captivated by their interplay.

The raw intensity and electrified feeling of a live performance is almost impossible to portray on the screen, bizarre and ferociously original piece of cinema – this will be entertaining and relevant for as long as brutality and injustice exist.

1366034579.0,1ce0m1,IJW: Chasing Amy (1997),ben_smith_123,14,3,11,"Kevin Smith’s genuinely touching and consistently funny indie comedy-drama about love and friendship. Lifelong friends Holden (Ben Affleck) and Banky (Jason Lee) produce a moderately successful comic together, Holden is immediately attracted to her - but is devastated to discover she has a girlfriend. The pair develop a deep friendship

Initially exhibiting the typical Smith bawdy self-reflecting style, sardonic Banky, full of believable vitriol but also adeptly delivering moments of heartfelt sentiment.

The sharp script contains the wordy soul-searching and pop culture references you’d expect from Smith, creating authentic trauma as their friendship is pulled apart - a well-observed bromance from long before that was a standalone genre. The love story on the other hand doesn’t come off quite as well. The performances from Affleck and Adams are decent enough but they just lack a spark between them. A slightly odd couple, it’s occasionally hard to pick out what they actually see in each other – but the heart is a mysterious thing, and far more unexpected relationships than this bloom in real life. 

This is an alt teen film presented in a bright poppy gloss, moving and accessible - everything a comedy-drama should be.

This is a promising setup that offers plenty of enjoyment, instead glimpsing them briefly before moving on. That being said, it deserves commendation for bringing some of its concepts and structure to a mainstream audience. Blacker than the title and marketing would suggest, it does have the ability to shock and surprise. Unfortunately the layer of polish is so thick it’s often hard to see what is going on beneath the surface – as a result it often feels like very little.

Films are more entertaining when you know less about them, but it’s all painted with such broad strokes and sentimentality that they offer very little. Later scenes that deserve to be gut-wrenching are nothing of the sort. Tom Cruise is on top form as the laid-back millionaire tinged with mania and inner sadness (not a stretch for him) and does a fine job holding the film up during its meandering dull sections. Few actors have the presence or charm to keep you on side when a film is seemingly going nowhere, and despite his critics Cruise has that indefinable star quality that draws the eye. 

‘Vanilla Sky’ is a little too flabby and self-aware. On the whole it’s well handled (including a few truly memorable scenes) and is a gratifying

So first off a word of warning. The very first time I saw this film was in IMAX 3D. It was the 48fps cut. I'm sure most movie goers know about this. The 48 hertz (or whatever it is really called) creates a *very* smooth transition between frames. This creates that fake set look. The thing is, the only sets that were constructed were ones that are inside (I learned this from watching the video documentary). As I have said in previous reviews, movies that belong in a franchise have to accomplish several things: they must adequately add to the franchise, must be able to stand on its own feet, and it must connect to a deeper meaning. Blah Blah Blah it needs to be accurate to the novel, which this movie picks and chooses when it wants to rather well. 

* Obviously it connects very well to the the rest of the franchise extremely well. With most of the original cast (that are relevant in this film) returning

* As a standalone film I think it is quite good. Cinematography is just beautiful. Score is wonderful. Characters are lovable. I scoff at people when they try to tell me the golden age of films has long since passed. I argue that since the medium was so new back then we over looked flaws in script, cinematography. Now we hold all of these to such high standards. it is rare to see a film succeed in so many, however. The hobbit does that. With some of the best written and performed scenes I have seen in recent cinema (I'm looking at you riddles in the dark). Amazing performances by Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen lift this movie to more than just great.

* As a book movie. I enjoyed it. I don't need to see an extra hour about Bilbo and company stopping in the woods talking to Beorn. Who can turn into a bear. I thought they were faithful to the scenes that truly mattered. This movie is long as is. VERY LONG. They made cuts

* On a deeper level.This film is about your home. And what you will do for it. it's about empathy. feeling for other people and fighting for them. I didn't really buy into all of the spiritual things people try to make the LOTR about. Especially the Hobbit. It is a story about human weakness

The main character is addicting, and plays his role chillingly realistically. I think that's what my biggest commendation to this film is-It's so easy to relate to. We've all been teenagers who are angry at everything in the world, I just really want to get the point across that if you pass by this film at the video store, I HIGHLY recommend seeing this.

Robin Williams stars as Lance Clayton, is a unpopular, sexually deviant 4chan lurker (presumably) who attends the school Lance teaches at.  When his son accidentally *SPOILER* kills himself in a style reminiscent of David Carradine, Lance convinces the world that his son was actually a literary genius by writing a fake suicide note, and beyond that, an entire fake journal which becomes a successful book.  Lance is then thrust into the world of the mainstream appreciation of his ""son's work"", where everyone wants to hop on the ""We Heart Kyle"" bandwagon and grab their 15 minutes of fame.

1376175009.0,1k43iw,IJW: I Melt With You (2011),tigermoth,10,0,4,"Wow.  I'll just start by saying:  make sure you're in the right state of mind for some heavy shit before watching this.

*I Melt With You* tells the tale of four college friends reuniting for one of their birthdays at a getaway in Big Sur: Tim (Christian McKay), and Jonathan (Rob Lowe).  The reunion quickly descends into maddening drinking and drug abuse and drinking and drug abuse and a little more drinking.  We slowly learn more about each character's individual mid-life crisis as the days crawl by and brief moments of real conversation occur between periods of chaos.  Without giving too much away, about halfway through the movie something happens that drastically alters the plot and tone of the film; something from the friends' past that most of them (except for Tim) haven't thought about in ages.  Shit spirals downward from here until the end of the film, but in a very compelling way.

The cinematography was breathtaking in this film, very colorful.  Even inside their party house, where a majority of the film takes place, the lighting is very carefully thought out for individual scenes.  I would say this is one of the film's strongest suits.

The editing is a little chaotic at times and might make you uncomfortable or dizzy or sick

The sound mixing is slightly off at certain points

Great acting all around, but I think Thomas Jane was the stand out.  His character was the most wild, anyway, so it couldn't be helped, I suppose.  This movie probably didn't need to feature Sasha Grey, but at least she only played a thinly veiled version of herself.  Seriously, though, don't be too put off by this.  She's barely in it.  Just wanted to comment.)

The soundtrack was spot on and mirrored the themes of the plot perfectly.  There are some times when the music is wayyy louder than the dialogue

Have I rambled enough?  I'll end by saying that *I Melt With You* is **definitely** not for everyone, etc.  One of the recurring ideas is that it's impossible to recapture the past, and that, in essence, is responsible for the drastic change in plot in Act 2.

I would recommend this to people who like dark films that are intellectually challenging.  Also, too.

Gritty crime sequel about the dirty deals and corruption that plague Rio de Janeiro – from the shanty towns to high office. Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura), and from his own force. Recently divorced, his wife and son now live with her new partner Fraga (Irandhir Santos), an outspoken liberal who frequently criticises BOPE and police violence in the media. Feeling he’s losing his son to a pacifist, and the system to ingrained profiteering, Nascimento is determined to set everything straight.

Unlike Nascimento and BOPE, the end result feels a little shallow. It suffers similar indecision with its morals, admonishing police brutality, while equally stylising and revelling in it – an emotional conflict that Nascimento is himself suffering, but that doesn’t make it any easier to engage with. The spectacle of the violence itself is impressively brash and gritty, but the toneless moralising proves distracting – not eloquent enough to invoke scrutiny.

It clearly overreaches intellectually, providing several breathtaking memorable moments. However that is all they are - moments. Characters are so lightly sketched that even Nascimento doesn’t develop discernible emotional engagement. This doesn’t necessarily hamper it as an action flick, but as it aspires to something deeper it has to be considered a shortcoming. Revisiting the documentary-style realism of the first film, it does feel a little cleaner with a more mainstream gloss and a brighter colour palette. In keeping with the idea that sequels should be ‘bigger and better’, it takes the small centralised idea of the first film and attempts to make it more epic and accessible. It still looks fantastically gritty and authentic, utilising a restless energy that doesn’t allow for a moment's boredom, but the long hinted at emotional punch fails to arrive.

Individually everything is well-handled

Jay Baruchel makes the trip to LA to hang out with his old friend Seth Rogen. After playing video games and getting suitably stoned Seth persuades the reluctant Jay to go to an A-list party at James Franco’s house. It’s as awkward and nauseating as he fears, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson. With no one to look after the pampered stars they attempt to fend for themselves

This is obviously a completely self-indulgent concept and an opportunity for a bunch of friends to laugh at each other's jokes – but by virtue of the sheer natural comedic ability of all the cast, thanks to the incessant jokes it is constantly amusing and never begins to drag – an achievement considering the confined location and lack of momentum. Many of the biggest laughs come from a slew of cameos, with the demure Michael Cera playing a lecherous coke fiend being a particular highlight. Unfortunately Shelf Heroes’ favourite, Paul Rudd, is restricted to the briefest of walk-ons, which is almost unforgivable. 

The more conventional horror elements are surprisingly well-handled, and the actors probably had more fun than the audience will. Nonetheless it’s uplifting Saturday fun with a touch of bromance sweetness and more than enough laughs. If the thought of being locked up with Seth Rogen and Danny McBride didn’t appeal to you before, this will do absolutely nothing to change that.

Michael J. Fox is always watchable and does solid work here as the affable Frank – bringing some humanity and warmth into what would otherwise be a fairly distant experience. The real stars of ‘The Frighteners’ though are its design and effects. Released in 1996 they haven’t aged a day thanks to a fairly lo-fi look. The human ghosts feel believably part of the scenes and capture an authentic pellucid physicality

These elements have obviously been shown some real love and attention - and make the film worthwhile. Backed by a spooky, almost like a ride on a ghost train at times, with fewer laughs (or scares) than there ought to be. A rollicking final third does much to make amends for this, and overall it’s good superficial fun throughout – not outstaying its welcome and conjuring up an impressively tactile stylised world. Amounting to less than the sum of its parts, the disposable 100 minutes provide sufficient small pleasures.

I’m not sure this is an accurate summary from IMDB, but I also didn’t view India Stoker as infatuated with Charlie. She’s a normal 18 year old girl who is rightly curious about this stranger who suddenly settles down as a long-staying guest in her home. But hey, who writes these IMDB summaries anyway?
 
The first half of the film is slow moving and sets the scene
Chan-wook Park’s style. I did find my mind wandering
Unfortunately the first half also served as a reminder that not only is Kidman always cast in the same roles (an upper-class, and again one that we can’t relate to nor grow to care about), but that I really do not like her acting. Matthew Goode’s acting is also a little wooden, although his is not particularly irksome. 

Mia Wasikowska, Park or no Park, and tried again another time, or in chunks. 

The second half of the film redeems it, some of the surprises are a little clichéd and I was able to guess what was coming next in quite a few parts in the film, [for example, India masturbates, cue her suddenly wearing a silk negligee instead of her usual dowdy clothing, and her annual present of a pair of shoes from her uncle for her 18th birthday were a very predictable set of Jimmy Choos](/spoiler), but overall it made the film enjoyable enough to recommend watching it.

This has been posted before, I apologize and understand.

*tone: informative*

[IMDb link.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184339/?ref_=sr_1)

**Basic synopsis:**

*tone: friendly musing

The Purge is a psychological thriller set in the near future, economic problems, and more are all essentially ""fixed"" due to a one-day-a-year event, called The Purge, where all crimes are legal for 12 hours. Emergency/police services are unavailable during this time, so it's an ""every man for himself"" vibe.

The plot follows the very well-off Sandin family, they lockdown their house with state-of-the-art security systems, bars, barricades, locks, and more, with surveillance equipment (audio and video) all over the place. It seems like they're going to have a quiet, when the violence comes to their usually-unbothered rich neighborhood. The son takes pity on a homeless black man who is terrified and fleeing a mob hunting him, young adults who are clearly as insane as they are cold, they will break into the house and kill everyone inside.

Of course they kill the electric power to the house (the security systems say in place due to a power generator backup), of course, once the mob breaks in, it becomes a hunt between both sides (the Sandins vs. the mob) to kill the opposing side first.

**My review:**

*tone: thoughtful*

I have always been interested in the idea proposed in The Purge: would society actually change if we gave permissions such as these? Would allowing murder (along with many other horrific crimes) actually make things better, and who they're ""allowed"" to be on one day a year?

This idea is by no means new. But The Purge was the first movie I've seen that incorporated some flavors of race and class into it. There is almost no unemployment or poverty because the middle and upper class citizens hunt and kill those who are unemployed, it was obviously very intentional that they had the homeless man be black, to underscore the racism that would inevitably occur when lower class people are the ones being hunted.

However... the idea, with a decent amount of tension, violence, and some gore.

I wasn't expecting much from the movie -- such a layered, a half-assed execution of said idea, and the brainless entertainment of a ""good"" bad movie.

I ended up enjoying it for what it was. By no means was it a smart movie. By no means was it a flawless movie. But it was fairly fun.

I would recommend it only if your expectations are low and your spirits reasonably high. Don't go out of your way to see it

Released from a young offenders institution 4 years later – still under the looming presence of ‘Earth 2’ – Rhoda attempts to restart her life and atone for her mistakes.

This is a lo-fi indie affair charged with an ever-present melancholy and running as a 90 minute riff on the idea, and lends an added accessibility to Rhoda’s emotions – possibly too literally, but the film’s confidence and originality are enough to keep you on side.

Shot in a hazy dreamlike quality, deviated from their expected paths – the film washing over us in a blue tinted sombre haze, days and weeks merging together and passing by. It effectively creates a consistent solemn aura that lingers long after the credits. Narratively there are few surprises and, after some reveals in the first half, it plays out as expected, but it’s through character and ideas that ‘Another Earth’ is most satisfying. Communicating an abstract thought in an uncomplicated way is no mean feat, and this is where science-fiction comes into its own as a genre. Marling is exceptional as the lead producing a natural, sharing a compelling awkward chemistry with the equally adept Mapother.

Created with next to no budget, the plot takes a few diversions that sit uneasily with the rest of the picture, and our sympathies with Rhoda are never as strong as they might be – but as a thoughtful study of an everyday idea, it’s an unqualified success articulated with originality and ambition.

In a twisted world without child protection services and despicable parenting, Miss Trunchbull at school. The only person to truly recognize Matilda's special gifts is her teacher, Miss Honey. The film is a bit darker than the book but does a great job of capturing the story.

If there is one thing that the film succeeds at is that it completely captures how intolerable Matilda's parents and Miss Trunchbull are. The performances are rage-inducing and show how innocent Matilda is. The camera angles are dizzying at times, especially Miss Trunchbull who tosses a girl by her hair, nearly hits people with darts and even locks Matilda in the ""Chokey"", a closet surrounded in nails. At times it is easy to wonder how much further the torture could have gone if the primary audience was not children.

On the opposite side of the spectrum are Matilda and Miss Honey who are the only characters that provide hope. Hope that things can change and that something positive can happen in a truly negative world.

I really like cop movies, but I felt for the most part it was an excellent choice. The calls that the two leads go on throughout the film are given a sense of immediacy and realism that I've never seen achieved outside of a reality show, and yet it still feels well crafted. Every call yields a tremendous amount of suspense because we as an audience are unsure of the dramatic violence that can happen at a moment's notice. It gives us a glimpse into the presence of mind of a police officer on a call; you have to be aware of your surroundings and constantly prepared for the worst. It is that sense of pacing which really made for a level of suspense I haven't felt in any movie that I have seen in recent memory. It also makes the violence, when it does come, all the more biting and furious. I've seen a lot of violent movies and have become a little numb to it, but I have to admit that I gasped several times during the film's more intense sequences.

I've always been on the fence about Jake Gyllenhal, given the fact that I am used to Pena playing bit parts in comedies. He carries the role of a lead brilliantly and manages to fuse a chemistry with Gyllenhal that feels profoundly genuine. You believe their relationship, which adds a tremendous amount of emotional weight to some of the film's heaviest moments. As someone who understands the needs of plot structure, I understand that a portion of the film needed to be devoted to the personal lives of the officers, but on the whole I felt that those were the weakest moments of the film.

Here’s a [YouTube link]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dlzv9inoqk) - it opens straight out with talking but that is the actual beginning. 

This is a somewhat frightening watch. Strangely for me, but I wasn’t able to feel much pity. Which is strange, because some of them are in truly dire situations, and I’m an empathetic person. 

Louis follows a small handful of people around and talks about their meth addictions, how it has affected family relationships and so on. There’s a lady who has to get off it because she’s not allowed her kids back, a couple who are so committed to one another that he won’t break the habit (despite being able to) because she just can’t ever wean herself off it, and then there’s a grandmother (or mother, I forget) in tears about an 18 year old boy. It’s all highly unpleasant really. 

The scariest aspect for me was the revelation of the cost for a hit. Only $20. Now, and I have since discovered a good friend who has two near best friends who are addicted. That’s just from one American I know… he had a string of random texts from one of them recently and they were far, far removed from anything slightly sane. Threats, tantrums, love you, hate you, you judge me,  completely ineligible text in some parts

That’s two formerly good people ruined there. So, but it always does come. And this terrifies me. This is not a habit you can easily break, you can’t put a patch on for 30 days and it’ll go away forever. It’s a seriously addictive habit and if you’re unfortunate enough to also have an addictive personality… well, you’re frankly screwed. 

I’m hoping that I’m proven wrong.  If I try to consider it logically, vast plains of empty space for miles and miles on end, except for perhaps the Yorkshire Moors, but then a lot of people ramble (do long walks) across those. 

Breaking Bad suddenly seems a bit less entertaining now that I know a little more of the harsh reality of the drug :/

Justin Lin's Tokyo Drift was up until now the only entry in the Fast and the Furious franchise I enjoyed and after the awful 4th film it seemed as if it was an accidental success and we were back to everything I loathed about the previous installments. Yet, it is also competently made in every regard. With the exception of some dodgy CGI here and there the frankly ludicrous action scenes are well-made, exciting and easy to follow. Justin Lin seems to have finally learnt how to shoot proper action scenes and thanks to a highly creative mind created some of the most fascinatingly stupid and entertaining action set pieces I've seen in a long time, especially from a blockbuster franchise like this.

Fast Five is big, this is the first in the series that has not a single section of boredom and with dialogue as ridiculous as the action scenes it put a smile on my face that never faded and at times broke out in laughter. The chemistry between the cast is the best of the series yet and although none of them will win an Oscar for their efforts, particularly Vin Diesel, whose expression seems to be stuck in place, they are serviceable and convincing in their stupidity. Snappy one-liners, an engaging storyline, competent direction and genuinely exciting action sequences that go from stupid to retarded - Fast Five sets the example for summer blockbusters and, is absolutely brilliant entertaining that I'm sure I'll revisit many times.

‘Oz’ has all the baggage of the 1939 classic to carry and feels restricted because of it, making him feel slightly miscast, although as Oz himself is a stranger from another world it’s conceivably intentional. Not to say he's bad - Franco is always watchable and is clearly having fun in the role, hamming it up and producing plenty of solidly funny moments. Michelle Williams on the other hand is exceptional as the ‘Good Witch’ – radiating pure Hollywood goodness with a humanity behind her eyes that lights up the screen. Judy Garland would be proud.

The production is a curious mix of flawless and ropey visual effects. Excellent character design (The little China Girl being a memorable highlight) contrasts with plainly artificial backdrops which seemingly allude to cinema past and the aesthetic of the 1939 production but feel awkward and cheap – a poor attempt to cultivate nostalgia and a waste of an opportunity to imagine an entirely new inventive universe. 

Lacking any real tension or threat, rapid pacing and a decent script keep everything flying along with very few dull moments. A far more worthy film than other family jaunts – director Sam Raimi’s influence is clear, utilising the frights and flashes of black humour that made his name in the ‘Evil Dead’ series. A little too shallow to be considered an out-and-out success, it at least avoids becoming the saccharine romantic morality tale of so many PG adventures. Its heart is in the right place - and offers up 130 minutes of outlandish magical diversion.

I never much cared for Gus Van Sant as a director as his style is frankly uninteresting. However, drawn out shots, natural dialogue and everyday scenarios give the movie an eerily realistic atmosphere as we follow a group of High School kids on their daily routine on what looked to be an ordinary day for them. The camera is almost not noticeable, carefully observing the characters make their way through the hallways, showing their interactions from every character's perspective. The idea is to make the audience grow accustomed to the place and learning of a select few students' troubles, plans, etc. It's done really well and even though it takes a very long time doing so with many minute-long takes of people simply walking, it's an effective method.

Due to the way it is shot it's almost as if the audience is transported into the school, who no one would suspect to commit such a thing. The problem I have is that we simply don't get to spend enough time with the two and the apparent inner hate they carry with them really doesn't come across quite as convincing as it needs to. It's a shame as I think there was a lot of room for Van Sant to do so. The film's final 15-ish minutes are very difficult and almost unbearable to watch. Whether the execution played any part in that or it is merely down to the content I am not sure yet, but it's certainly effective. The very last scene in the freezer is particularly disturbing.

Overall, the other students that is, is portrayed excellently. I may have written off Gus Van Sant too quickly.

1362260859.0,19jjc5,IJW: Searching For Sugar Man (2012) - documentary about a lost musician who was compared to Dylan,Girlwithnousername,11,0,2,"I highly recommend not googling the artist’s name before watching the documentary unless you want it completely spoilt for you.

The opening 30 seconds: ""It’s 40 years since this LP called Cold Fact by Rodriguez was released and in South Africa it was a very popular album, we had all the information we needed, but this guy – there was nothing.""

(quote continues in the spoiler section).

In 1970s apartheid-era South Africa

Nobody quite knew how a small-time artist called Rodriguez exploded; in fact they don’t even know how his music came to the country in the first place as it was not released there. But what his music did was to unite the youth of the day who felt as though things were very wrong with regard to segregation and the general direction SA was heading towards, he encouraged rebellion and free-thinking. 

He was likened to Bob Dylan (but adored way beyond levels of Dylan

So. Who was Rodriguez? Nobody was ever able to find anything out about him. And what ever happened to him?

***SPOILER FOLLOWS***

Continuation of opening 30 seconds quote: 

""…and then we found out that he had committed suicide. He set himself alight on stage and burnt to death in front of the audience. It was the most incredible thing

1332892143.0,rgo2n,IJW Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974),OneSalientOversight,10,2,0,"I found out about this film many years ago when it was referenced in a Simpsons Halloween episode as ""Alice Doesn't Live Anymore"".

This 1970s film was obviously influenced by the growing feminist movement at the time

So... could she live without a man? The audience both feel her pain at the loss of the man she loves but also happiness that she has been given freedom from an emotionally abusive relationship.

We soon find, since Alice has experience as a bar-room singer and piano player.

She finds work but the money is not enough to pay expenses. She then begins a relationship with Ben (Harvey Keitel). Things are looking up until suddenly Alice is confronted by Ben's wife who appears to be in a similar situation - in a controlled, is continually ill.

Suddenly we see Ben in a different light. At first he appeared young

Alice and Tommy pack up and leave very quickly. We're happy that she escapes Ben. Then she settles in Tucson where she finds work not as a singer but as a waitress.

The greasy spoon she works in is just right for a sitcom to be based and that is precisely what happens as in the years following this film's release *Alice* appears as a TV series from 1976-1985 with pretty much the same characters. Alice is the waitress who's moved to Tucson after her husband died and dreams of a singing career while simultaneously having to deal with her precocious son; Flo is the sassy

The job isn't wonderful but Alice is able to get enough money to support herself and Tommy.

Of course during the film (not the sitcom) we wonder at how good David (Kris Kristofferson) will be. Soon we're disappointed as he seems to turn into yet another manipulative and controlling man

As the film ends on a high note, but also the potential for marriage to David, a wealthy farmer. She's also come to terms with the abuse she's suffered over the years.

The reason why ADLHA is a good feminist film is that it shows realistic blue-collar female empowerment. It's not about higher wages or access to professional careers or the glass ceiling. Instead it is about to freedom to control one's life and be happy, painful attachment. There's no doubt that she loves David but she also loved the abusive Ben and Donald (her dead husband). A relationship with a man is not something that is dismissed in the film (as per radical feminism) but is accepted and seen as one of the most important part of Alice's life - yet these relationships are painful and sometimes abusive. ADLHA doesn't end with a radical feminist victory by allowing Alice to live happily without any male relationship at all - instead it grants her the victory of happiness while simultaneously granting her a positive relationship with a male.

Ellen Burstyn rightly won the academy award for this role. She was able to convey a huge range of emotions throughout the film. The audience laughed and cried with her, but we then realise the reason why Alice was doubled up with her hands over her face was because she could not control her laughter at the Flo/Mel confrontation. Suddenly we see a victory for her and the event leads to a deep friendship between Flo and Alice.

The Mel's diner actors - Vic Tayback as Mel

Kris Kristofferson has never been a favourite actor of mine. As far as I'm concerned the only role of substance he played that I enjoyed was that of Charlie Wade in the 1996 film *Lone Star*. His role here was effective but not outstanding.

As I pointed out before

Jodie Foster has a bit part in the film, very effectively.

I'm sad that Alfred Lutter didn't make it as an adult actor. Although Foster dominated his scenes with her

I loved Sgt Schultz. ""I am your friend!"" he declares over and over. He even has some great banter with the POWs.

The comedy duo of Animal and Shapiro is so well done that it deserves far more praise than it has received. From the get-go these two clowns dominate the film's lighter moments. This culminates with a drunk Animal dancing with a Betty Grable looking Shapiro and murmuring sweet nothings to him/her.

The bit parts are great too. There's the guy who receives a letter from his wife saying that a baby was left on their doorstep and you wouldn't believe it but the baby has her mouth and eyes and nose. ""I believe it"" the man says, is privvy to but this requires a step of understanding from the audience (which shows that the director respected their intelligence).

Then there's the announcement guy - the guy who moves from barracks to barracks and gives announcements and hands out letters. ""NEXT"" he says in a strange high pitched voice after everyone has quieted down from the last announcement. ""AT EASE"" he yells, there is a moment of quiet and then ""NEXT"".

William Holden's character is wonderful. I'm glad he was compelled by the director and the movie studio to keep his character selfish and morally ambiguous. Had Holden had his way his character would've had some more positive elements. As a result his character was more compelling - he was a selfish jerk who took advantage of his fellow POWs and even bribed the Germans a few times... but he was also the one who discovered the traitor in their midst after being mistreated by suspicious comrades. Holden's character (Sefton) was repugnant but the audience knew that he was innocent of the crime of betrayal and while we could understand the frustration of his comrades (and even identify with them) Sefton's beating at their hands left us with an unpleasant taste in our mouth - that an innocent man (though repugnant) was being punished for a crime he didn't commit.

As the film progresses I

A few issues I had: If the guys in Barracks 4 were so certain that Sefton was the spy

The unmasking of the spy at the end was not done well enough either. There was too much circumstantial evidence presented to the POWs from someone they didn't trust much anyway.

As for the spy's punishment and death... why not just fall to the ground silent and yell out ""help"" in German rather than stumble around making noise and attracting the attention of the machinegunners in the watch towers? After all - that was the plan the POWs explicitly told the spy was his punishment.

Holden was brilliant and deserved his oscar for this. Director Billy Wilder goes up and up in my estimation.",,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/raps9/ijw_stalag_17_1953/

For those who don't want it spoiled

*SPOILER TERRITORY AHOY*

From a scientific angle the notion of two planet earths in the solar system right next to each other with no ill consequences is total bullshit. The gravitational effects would wreak havoc

The rest of the plot I can't be so forgiving about. The main character Rhoda starts out the story by causing a car wreck (possibly while under the influence of alcohol as I recall her drinking at the party) through her inattention. That lands her in prison for a four year stretch.

The rest of the movie seems to mostly forget that she's a convicted felon though. Sure it's mentioned in her essay

Another rule that felons have to follow is that they aren't allowed to contact the person they wronged. They have to sign an agreement saying that they won't even write them a letter lest they face heavy penalties like going back to prison. Sure we can assume that Rhoda is a character stupid or naive enough to justify breaking such a rule out of a misguided need for absolution

It also seems idiotic that all of the major breakthroughs with this other earth are happening when they do. This alternate planet has been in the sky right next to us for four fucking years and we're only now getting around to making radio contact with them?! And that's only happening shortly after the announcement of a contest to win a slot on the first space flight to this oddity? Also it seems really poorly thought out that this flight is coming out of the corporate sector instead of the government. I imagine this is supposed to be some sort of nod to the direction that space exploration is actually going

These might seem like minor things to complain about, but it just comes off as boring and pretentious.

The plot problems I'm angry about, she rushes over to John's house to give him her ticket because there's a chance that his family is still alive on the other Earth. The only problem with this idea is that if they are alive on Earth 2, so is an alternate version of John. Which would make the John Burroughs that we're seeing become the ultimate 5th wheel intruding on a group of people that have no place for him. What kind of consolation is that?

If the movie had stopped there I might have been somewhat okay with that. I could have shrugged it off as an ambitious attempt at saying something important that fell flat. Unfortunately the creators chose to go one step further and flush away what little credibility they had left. The parting shot of Rhoda coming home from her shitty day job only to see her alternate self in the driveway before cutting to credits... that was just too much of an insult. I imagine a lot of people will try to justify this as a clever and ambiguous way to end the story. It isn't. It's lazy writing. It honestly felt like the director/writer couldn't figure out a way to end the story and went with the best shocker he could pull out of his ass.

Welcome to the Punch holds it own as a good crime drama but where it could go from good to great it fails in the 'conspiracy' being too far removed from the main characters and the ending left a little to be desired (see Elite Squad 2 for an idea of how to end something like this).

When her long time best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner) moves out to live with her boyfriend

This is a downright joyous experience, predictable theme that makes for dull, crowd-pleasing cinema – and bears next to no relation to life. 'Frances Ha' is about Frances, not about her love life or big life-changing moments. Realism is high on the agenda throughout and to its credit it doesn’t resort to grit, nudity or sex to convey that – proving that strong characterisation is always what matters most.

Its success predominantly rests on co-writer and star Greta Gerwig who is absolutely fantastic, but in a wholly plausible, endearing way – doing the weird little things we all do when no one's around. Most importantly she’s not just a great comedy character, she’s a real person; we’re laughing both with and at her, but we still intensely care about her.

‘Frances Ha’ is a small-scale film that may have the aesthetic of a student work, weaving her ups and downs together with montages and short scenes of all the little incidental things in life. Unconcerned with too much exposition we are dropped into Brooklyn and fly through this confusing transitional year in her life, the film passing by as quickly as the years that are escaping Frances.

Here is a film that deserves to be cherished by everyone – an honest and uplifting journey through friendship and adulthood

It's too bad The Spectacular Now is rated R because the teenagers being kept out of theaters are the ones who will undoubtedly feel the deepest connection to it. I kind of hope they sneak into this movie in droves because if they don't they're missing out on maybe the first movie of their generation that will plug into their actual experiences in an honest

It's not soul-crushingly dark like Kids was for my generation

That's not to say it's perfect

The movie opens with Miles Teller (think Shia LaBeouf's more likable little brother) as Sutter Keely, and to force the the oh-so-messed-up young Sutter to examine himself later in the movie. It's just barely better than outright voiceover.

Sutter is about to graduate from high school, smart girlfriend (Brie Larson) just dumped him. Together the two of them were drunk and happy, and as he puts it ""indestructible."" He can't quite articulate it because he's a teenager, but he's thiiiis close to realizing that without her — his partner in mischief — his alcoholism stops seeming like fun, and starts looking pathetic. He's also about to learn how far from indestructible he really is.

Enter Shailene Woodley as the so-naive-it-hurts Aimee Finicky — convincing as a mostly ignored girl who doesn't realize how much better her life is without Sutter in it. She's living with her absentee mother and paying their bills by getting up at 5am every day to deliver newspapers. One Saturday morning she discovers Sutter passed out on a stranger's lawn, who exist in wholly different strata of the high school hierarchy. From the distance of adulthood the two aren't very different, but director James Ponsoldt successfully assigns every dissimilarity the profound weight of teenage scrutiny.

Those differences and similarities are expertly eked out over the course of the next 90 minutes as Sutter and Aimee act as each other's catalysts for the psycho-chemical process of growing up. In that process, and pieces of this movie felt like stepping through a time machine it was so real.

The three crowning moments come in a deftly written dinner scene (instantly one of my favorites of all time), Teller's face is as legible as a book, several realizations dawning on him at once as his twitchy dad, played by Kyle Chandler, disabuses him of the illusions he had of a hero patriarch kicked out of the house by his uptight mother.

Before we go any further, who has her own double whammy between this, and the upcoming Divergent franchise. She enjoyed awards buzz two years ago for her performance as George Clooney's drunken daughter in The Descendants, and is winning key roles in both critical darlings and blockbusters.

Woodley is the vulnerable, playing like some deconstruction of teen movies like She's All That. Here's an introverted girl uninterested in popularity who finds herself dating a popular, funny, boy who changes her in deep ways while nearly destroying everything good about her. Director Ponsoldt gives her several key close-ups and every one makes you feel more connected to and protective of this girl.

Now onto those flaws. Some critics will find fault with The Spectacular Now's twee style. The entire thing does look like it was filtered through Instagram in some attempt to tap into a cheap nostalgia. And, ""How many more movies do we need about white middle class problems?"" And the movie barely passes the Bechdel test. And Shailene Woodley's character seems to be cruelly written with a blind spot that makes her oblivious at times to the point of idiocy. But in the words of the movie's Keely Sutter, ""get off my motherf---ing back!"" I loved this movie, and it already has the hallmarks of a cultural touchstone for kids who grew up with Harry Potter and are seeking something more authentic than they've been given so far.",,False,,False,t3_1jol8f

Pros: I liked that they touched on how life is different in the post apocalypse and wish they'd spent more time on that. In shows like this the world they live in is the single most important character and it's usually underwritten.

Cons: There was some over the top gore near the end that made me roll my eyes. Much like ""John Dies At The End"", the budget... even the same kind of unresolved ending and plot holes. I can picture at least 3 seasons of winter wastelands and summery flashbacks ala Revolution or Lost.

Chronologically charting a long history of orca attacks in captivity ‘Blackfish’ effortlessly pieces together the story of the animals, and this is the film's crux – as a species we’ve taken a beautiful living being that is one of nature’s most intelligent

By far its most memorable moments are the home video and press footage captured at SeaWorld, but the revelations and imagery are so astounding this doesn’t pose a problem – anyway, no one in their right mind can claim these animals aren’t experiencing a lower quality of life at human hands.

On the surface ‘Blackfish’ is a gripping story of death and cover-ups, spiritual creature as a plaything. The kind of film that uses entertainment as a medium to engage, inform - and expose our self-righteous flaws.

Muay. Oh my god. I have never hated a character so much. I get that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and she served no purpose other than to be a women which makes people motivated to help her when she's in trouble. Same with all the other women in the show. ""Oh this guys getting beaten up, I don't care. Oh no! He's assaulting a women! I must help!""

The three wheeled car scene. There was not a moment I enjoyed during this part. Just out of no where there's like 50 of these fucking cars and half of them tip over one tenth way into the scene. Not a single scene was interesting

Boring plot with lots of padding. The whole plot is go get X thing

Good casual fun. Don't try and take this movie seriously and just enjoy the show.

I actually really enjoyed a lot of the fight scenes, and they were quite varied, which was refreshing from usual movies.

1374245864.0,1imu6o,IJW: Wadjda (2012),ben_smith_123,12,2,3,"Sweet naturalistic drama about Wadjda (Waad Mohammed)

'Wadjda' is most notable for being the first feature film to be shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, Haifaa al-Mansour. That this hasn’t happened until 2013 is jaw-dropping, and adds huge weight to the film. Imagining the constraints of the production and the adversity she plainly would’ve faced in her career make Wadjda’s turmoil all the more poignant.

The drama itself is thoroughly enjoyable, a completely absurd alien world to many of us in the West. Not being allowed to drive, hiding your voice from men, arranged marriages of children – all these oppressive customs are viewed in passing by the young Wadjda, but equally the film never condemns the religion, showing those who are at peace and able to find solace in the words of the Koran.

Newcomer Waad Mohammed is genuinely remarkable in the titular role. A young woman bursting with life, with a beautifully honest mother-and-daughter chemistry that again feels incredibly poignant in the context of the film as a milestone.

This is a staggeringly accomplished debut that presents its powerful social commentary in a light, important film that demonstrates what the best cinema is capable of – opening our lives to the experiences of others, through the medium of entertainment.

This is a quintessentially British noir, he possesses a cold-heartedness that is only warmed whilst dealing with Doreen who represents a purity and innocence in an otherwise black seedy town. The convoluted plot filled with sex and death also shares much with pulp fiction; Jack traces clues and corruption from one confrontation to the next, interrogating shady characters in dive bars and high rises. Set in England’s industrial north, and not Raymond Chandler’s L.A., it is charged with an oppressive bitter mood The Golden State could never offer.

Creating a genuinely tough watch that dispenses with almost any sentimentality, distant character, but Caine’s steely presence and charisma woven with the remorseless nature of his actions, his carnal lust and the winding mysteries of his dead brother bring you under the film's spell with enough power to keep the film compelling as its plot takes increasingly complex twists and turns. Its evocative power also stems from a haunting melancholy recurring theme, constructed of chiming harpsichord notes echoing around the screen with a delicacy that juxtaposes with the film’s aggression, every bit as memorable as the film itself. 

‘Get Carter’ is a little too chaotic to provide the narrative satisfaction it wants to

Ryan Gosling seems to lose the Texas twang every now and then and Anthony Hopkins has a convincing Irish-ish accent. The movie started out well. The movie is quickly set up but it didn't feel rushed. The progression was steady. And the ending was fair. 

I sympathized with Goslings character. There were a couple of key moments that were predictable but Gosling played the character so well that I was in for the ride and I let him drive. Hopkins on the other hand was going into Hannibal Lecter mode. I'm disappointed that the director let him do that. It felt like he put more effort on the accent.

I have no idea what just happened. Field of Dreams is incredibly corny, a film that on paper should be absolutely horrible and torture for mind and body. However, from beginning to end I was completely invested in this magical, charming little movie, and despite knowing how cheesy it is I found it to be very moving and heart-warming. There is something about it that just makes it work and really won me over within minutes. When something this sentimental gets made today it'd be a cynical, mean-spirited cash-grab on unsuspecting or undemanding audiences, but the 80s seemed to have been the perfect time for movies like this. The film is so naïvely innocent in nature, I struggle to believe anyone could have a negative reaction to it.

Field of Dreams in some ways really harks back to Classic Hollywood with its lack of real conflict or anything truly threatening whatsoever, wrapped together in an All-American fashion, and carrying a distinctly youthful spirit. Despite not seeming that way at first glance it touches upon some real, mature themes, mostly about father-and-son relationships, and does so with grace and intelligence.

A classic example of cinema magic, but it's such a pleasant, sweet, and innocent film. Sometimes that's all you need.

Noah Baumbach's personal story of his own adolescence and how he and his family dealt with the separation of his parents is a film rich in emotion, without ever feeling forced at anything. Although not always expressed verbally, one can see the anguish in each of the characters through their actions and demeanors. What I expected to be a highly quirky comedy with a bittersweet ending turned out to be staggeringly human in its portrayal of a broken family. It's a very quiet film that, especially in retrospect, says a lot more than what can be found on its surface.

Baumbach clearly poured his heart into this film and it really shows. The characters so accurately represent people I've met in the past they could only stem from actual persons. Laura Linney, low-key performances and make some of the scenes painful to watch. Eisenberg's turn as the insecure, pretentious teenager always seeking his father's approval at everything he does, is layered and impressive for his age. He perfected his acting capabilities in The Social Network, but early on in his career already showed his promising talent. The Squid and the Whale is a very short film, but the amount of subtext fit into these 80 minutes is impressive and the end result is very moving.

Lilo &amp; Stitch marks one of the last truly great films to come out of Disney Animation Studios and despite always wanting to I never really got the chance to watch it. A huge loss on my behalf as it turns out to be a hilarious and genuinely warm-hearted piece of animation, being aggressive in nature and distrusting almost everyone. His relationship with Lilo develops very differently, beginning as merely a means of protecting himself, but as time goes by slowly growing into a bond.

Like with the two other already mentioned films, who through the help of Stitch find themselves again. It's been done before but Lilo &amp; Stitch offers a new spin on the whole idea and with enough variables being changed ends up being wonderfully charming and due to its eye-meltingly beautiful animation quite a ride for the senses. The only real fault I can think of is the series of action scenes towards the end, which are entirely unnecessary and remind me of the many mistakes Disney has made since then. It doesn't ruin the film, but certainly sticks out as bitter in what is otherwise sweet and endearing.

There aren't many adjectives to describe Julian Schnabel's dazzling The Diving Bell and the Butterfly that really do it justice and it's honestly been a while since a movie last made me speechless. The initial response I usually have to this type of uplifting, however obnoxious he had previously been, crafted a film of rare beauty and hard-hitting power that at one moment has you broken down in tears and in the next jumping fist-first in the air. With the performances of a lifetime, an intelligent script and breathtaking visuals from veteran cinematographer Kaminski and a true visionary on board in the form of Schnabel, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a truly wondrous, transcendental piece of film-making.

Without wanting to sound hyperbolic, makes you feel everything the protagonist feels, be it the initial fear and claustrophobia, the self-destructive pity following shortly and finally the acceptance of his state and the utterly inspiring will power. Schnabel created one of those rare moments in cinema, in the words of Kermode: a movie you don't just watch but actually sense, as if you can touch or taste it.

The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is such a rich and rewarding film it demands to be seen rather than read about in the review of an amateur critic. Do yourself a favour and get a copy of it

Rob Reiner these days is known for repulsively corny, meaning it is full of biting humor and a winning chemistry between the leads. It's nothing extraordinary nor original, but thanks to a good script and the much needed good performances works perfectly well.

Rom-Coms nowadays are 99% crap, when even in his lesser earlier work there is a lot be found to like. The Sure Thing is by no means a classic but certainly worth a watch as I can't really see anyone not falling for it.

Often dubbed as one of the greatest films about film-making, Nancy Allen and the always reliable John Lithgow, along with an interesting premise which merges Antonioni's Blowup with Coppola's The Conversation. Whereas Coppola's work was rather conventional in the visual department (I can't comment on Blowup since I haven't seen it), de Palma's film is quite experimental and features some brilliantly inventive shots, as well as an interesting colour palette that focuses on stark reds. Brian de Palma always makes visually interesting films but this may very well be his greatest in that area and repeatedly had me smile as it must've been a blast to shoot.

The central performances are excellent and carry a little of that B-Movie vibe I so often notice in said director's films. Although a fairly dark flick it doesn't take itself too seriously

So Hoop Dreams (1994) is a wildly ambitious documentary that follows the lives of two inner-city Chicago teens (over the span of five years) who both dream of one day entering the NBA. Both of them seem untouchably talented and capable in their own right, stratified world of high school basketball, but also into the struggle of two families to stay together through financial and emotional problems. 

I was really amazed by this film. I don't think I've seen something that so broadly encapsulates what it is to be human--to hope, to look after one's family.

I feel like I've missed so much by not knowing about Chan-wook Park's work. 
Let me say
The opening scene made my jaw drop with this beautifully written India's monologue:

 [""My ears hear what others cannot hear; small faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me. These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing, I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone. I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse, and shoes which are from my uncle. This is me. Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be. Only once you realize this do you become free, and to become adult is to become free."" ](/spoiler) 

that even stopped me from eating my popcorn and focusing on her words


The movie itself has a slow plot development

[even though she ended up in a very bad place which she was probably destined for, really bad thing from happening and going far away from her ''home''.](/spoiler).

1365964137.0,1cc5q4,IJW: Trance (2013),ben_smith_123,12,2,2,"Visually stylistic but superficial psychological crime thriller centred around an art heist. Young auctioneer's assistant Simon (James McAvoy) aids a gang of thieves led by Frank (Vincent Cassel) to steal a Goya painting just sold by his auction house for £25m. A blow to the head during the plan causes partial amnesia and he fails to remember where he concealed the artwork while escaping. After withstanding Frank’s brutal torture the gang eventually buy his story – and contact a Harley Street hypnotist

Despite a strong opening that hints at a rollicking criminal caper, layered psyche. The cast of characters are uniformly untrustworthy and not notably likeable so without a strong driving narrative it's difficult to invest much in them – especially as they’re all fairly flat - and for much of ‘Trance’ the events taking place aren’t sufficiently engaging either. However, well shot and put together, it almost conjures up enough pleasure to override this. Drawing an unusual stylistic portrait of modern London that parallels slick glass apartments with grimy clubs and back alleys – tinted with a recurring palette of orange, blue and red alongside frequent nods to classic noir – it’s an enjoyable world to be swept up in. A pounding electronic soundtrack culled straight from the 90s does much to keep things exhilarating and moving along – totally over the top, the intense music is frequently more interesting than the action on screen. The mysteries and unknowns should make every frame riveting: however, the film shifts around and ties so many knots keeping up becomes tiresome

When ‘Trance’ eventually kicks into gear in the final third it atones for an entirely forgettable start, dark ride - a tonal shift that isn’t really in keeping but at least some ‘stuff’ is happening. Utterly implausible and verging on unfathomable, it ramps up the sex, violence and deceit beyond belief – seemingly pleased to leave the plot to one side and simply have some gratuitous visceral fun. A chaotic mess that just about hangs together, it still has enough shallow pleasures to leave you satisfied – if a little baffled as to what the hell you just watched.

As you've no doubt previously read

As a result, we've made some changes over the last few months. I don't think these have been drastic changes, namely, they are:

-	Removing one-line reviews and [giving some guidance on reviewing]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/19smw3/mod_reminder_post_content_in_your_reviews_we_are/)
-	Asking for [IMDB links in all submissions]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1bbsdk/mod_post_imdb_links_need_to_be_included_in_all/)
-	Adding to the sidebar that all submissions need to include the year (as stated on IMDB)

Unfortunately we are still spending most of our time on the sub asking people to include an IMDB link (despite changing the submission bar to have a red ‘include an IMDB’ box). We get several reports of incorrect submissions flagged by users each day. Stating the year of the film is becoming increasingly relevant due to numerous film re-makes. Frankly

So the Autobot will filter out reviews which don’t include the film year and an IMDB link and it will automatically send them to the spam filter. Now, that probably gets checked four times a day.

it's about a guy (Andy) who works in a bank and is sent to Shawshank Prison (which is corrupt) for supposedly murdering his wife. After a month, he asks him for a rock hammer, a tool he claims he needs for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting. 

Over the course of a few years, as this is a rule the IRS have. Though Hadely at first threatens to throw Andy off the roof, he agrees, providing the men with cold beer before the job is finished. 

Word gets round that Andy is highly knowledgeable about taxes and he subsequently ends up doing the taxes for most of the guards

TL;DR:  Waaaaay too long

The movie is five and a half hours long, none of the other five parts got made.

The first part has some fascinating camera techniques that could not be duplicated for decade after sound came in. The cameras tracked galloping horsed from stirrup-level

Gance's editing was also brilliant and new. There were several scenes where he cut people's faces into one long shot of faceafterfaceafterfaceafterface, Absalom!"" when he visited Miss Coldfield who's wisteria was in ""the savage quiet September sun impacted distilled and hyperdistilled."" Gance was brilliant and showing emotion and having us feel it with the characters.

However, kneeling in abject whatever. This was a style of acting, but it was passe in the US, where a more natural style had taken over by the time ""Napoleon"" was released here. (I recommend comparing the acting in Napoleon with that in ""Mating Call,"" for example. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mating_Call_(film) )

There were _many_ scenes that were breathtaking. The camera work with the galloping horses, chased by his would-be assassins. I much prefer the camera work of silent films to talkies because the directors could compose static shots with all the artfulness of master photographers, and we get many of those scenes where Napoleon stands in dramatic splendor.

Ultimately, and as the first of six parts, ""Napoleon"" fails to make it a dramatic story, in spite of all the considerable drama going on in France in the early days of Napoleon's life. The problem, for me, is that the movie makes one point: Napoleon was at his best when fighting against insurmountable odds. That's all we learn about him. But the point is made over and over and over. The movie is a hagiography of Napoleon, where he seems to bloom full-talented as a child and never changes. People wilt at his stare from his pre-teen years. And he goes on staring until the end of this movie as he invades Italy. 

The movie is _much_ more interesting to me technically than as a story. Gance used techniques that stand up to today's computer-generated graphics. The fast-paced editing in some scenes foretells MTV edit styles, because the spectacle could not fit on one screen, decades ahead of Cinerama.

His action with the camera was also decades ahead of its time. He used hand-held cameras in battle scenes to show us the jumble and confusion of war,"" the camera is a means to show us the action, not a part of the film itself.) I'll be checking to see what else cinematographer Jules Kruger has done.

I saw ""Napoleon"" in Oakland's Paramount Theatre, and I recommend reading about it in the Wikipedia page. The gallery of photos provides a very brief view of how wonderful the theater is. The music during the movie was provided by the Oakland East Bay Symphony, conducted by Carl Davis, the composer of the music. The music was magnificent, timed to the events in the movie. An excellent perfromance

I suspect you'll never get to see the movie. From one point of view, you'll miss the incredible talents of the director, the cinematographer, and the composer/conductor. The movie itself is too much of its time, in my humble opinion, but the creation of it has not been surpassed in terms of technique, editing, two men well ahead of their time. Like Richard Kelly, was very successful commercially as well as artistically.

I have a few photos of the interior of the theater and a video of the thunderous ovation for the composer and the heads of restoration of the film [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/civex/sets/72157629726506227/).",,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/rq82t/ijw_napoleon_1927/

Harry Dean Stanton did quite well as the Assistant Director with no money who kept scamming members of the cast and crew to get some. He didn't spend much time doing this

Justin Theroux did a really good job of being sleezy. His character disappears halfway through the film though.

Grace Zabriskie also did a good job as a very confusing Gypsy.

Review: I know I'm going get some flack for this review I but I'm cool with that. To begin

With that said I began my viewing and was completely blown  away by the sound, the costumes, the space ship scenes,  and the cinematography etc. I kept trying to figure out how they filmed the different gravity scenes without actually being in space. At one point I gave up and just decided to enjoy it. I could go on for days about the movie visually and praise it until there was nothing left to praise but I will go on to the negatives.

The *entire* 2 hours and 40 minutes I spent watching it I had not a clue what was really happening. The dialogue left a lot to be desired. I didn't need him to spell it out for me and I knew the whole point of the movie was the mystery behind the black monolith(after the ape scene) but every single time they changed who they were covering as the main character I couldn't help but feel like they were intentionally trying to frustrate me. This to say the least made my viewing very unpleasant. But still I trekked on hoping that it would all make sense at the end. What happened was the movie got more confusing after [Hal went crazy and was shut off. I realized something had happened to Dave and he was aging at a rapid rate but I had no idea what was going on especially after what felt like years of the acid trip scene.](/spoiler) 

Needless to say I was unhappy that the movie ended without an explanation and that I now had to look up what I had just watched for the last 3 hours. To me that was the unsuccessful part of the movie. It was so ridiculously long(i'll get to this) and to have the viewer not be able to understand a movie with more than enough time and obvious technique was ludicrous.

The length to me was tiresome. I'm all for a 3 hour movie and I actually prefer long movies with plots that take time to fully flesh out but this movie had really long sequences that dragged. The sequences inside the spaceships were aesthetically pleasing and the ending sequence with Dave [in the room aging](/spoiler) was especially gripping but every long sequence before and after that were tedious and boring. Especially the dawn of man one and the ones in outer space. I do know the pacing was done to create and sustain the eerie atmosphere he was going for but the movie would have been able to do that without the literal 9 minute [acid trip scene.](/spoiler) I guess I just expected more dialogue and what not in a almost 3 hour movie. 

All in all I rate the movie a 8 for amazing graphics, cinematography and editing especially for 1968 but I won't be watching this again.

There is much to admire in ‘Man of Steel’ - which only proves to make the final incoherent experience even more frustrating. The story isn’t so much told as depicted in a collection of set-pieces and disjointed scenes, so it’s unfair to condemn it completely. 

The production design and visual effects are remarkable. Although not breaking any new ground, fight sequences and action have real impact. The relentless battles do grow tiresome as the film’s climax wears on, but one small scale fight in the streets of Smallville is near perfect in its inventiveness and execution.

The casting is also spot on, but there are plenty of competent standalone scenes that provide a degree of emotional involvement. ‘Man of Steel’ is ultimately about fathers and sons and, despite lumbering storytelling, the relationship between Cavill and Costner has something touchingly honest about it. In general there's little fun to be had. The outrageous supernatural events are taken deadly seriously and such an outlook becomes wearisome - this isn’t an intelligent enough film to justify its po-face. A few touches of lightness or humour would certainly make the chaos more palatable.

Ultimately ‘Man of Steel’ is a huge event film that ‘has’ to be seen

[The other thing I liked about this movie was General Zod. He is my favorite kind of villain; someone who does villainous things but not out of a want for power or for the sake of evil

[The characters, a girl who is known for her attitude and drive to get the story, is watered down and uninteresting in this movie. Aside from finding out who Clark actually was, she served little to no purpose other than to be a love interest in a forced romance. I actually hated Clark's Earth father and didn't feel anything when he died (it's not good for a character when he suggests that Clark should have let some kids drown in a bus in the *first* scene he's in). His death was a stupid scene, anyway.](/spoiler)

[Another big problem I had with this movie was lack of development for Clark. One of the most important aspects of him was his moral compass. He is a force for good and would go out of his way to save a life. And you would think that in an origin story, the *very* next scene is comedic and it seems he's forgotten all about it. For doing something that caused him so much pain, they gave him no time to think on it especially since they never established his moral compass.](/spoiler)

[The movie also suffers from plot holes. A few that stood out to me was how in the hell did he hitchhike himself to the Arctic and convince all of those people he was part of the excavation team?  Why didn't Pa Kent send Clark, why do the Kryptonians feel the need to control their population? And in the end, the military *knows who he is*! So how are they having a hard time finding where he lives? There are many others that destroyed my investment in the story and ruined it for me.](/spoiler)

The Man Who Fell to Earth is a film that could only have been made in the 70s. Nic Roeg's strange and surreal Sci-Fi poses more questions than it answers, who is dying of thirst during a terrible drought, he ends up staying far longer than he had planned. To build his spacecraft he founds a corporation, presumably based on highly advanced technology already in use on his planet, and amasses staggering amounts of wealth and economical power. Of course, such huge success in a short period of time raises some eyebrows and things get complicated for him.

Roeg is a master at cinematic crafts and The Man Who Fell to Earth is no exception, as well as creative editing. The disjointed, cut-up narrative walks the fine line between coherent and confusing with utmost precision, resulting in a picture that requires full attention from its audiences. Although not a whole lot happens explicitly within the 2 hours and 20 minutes, the strange, otherworldly, and occasionally extremely creepy atmosphere that lingers over the screen makes this secretive

Roeg proves once more to be one of the most interesting and versatile directors of his time with a hugely atmospheric genre film

The 2008 film based on part of the life of the Argentine doctor and revolutionary Che Guevara during the Cuban revolution. Che is played very well by Benicio Del Toro (who looks very much like him). 

The film spans 3 timelines but this does not get confusing, this is based around a meal and talk Che would have when he met Fidel, the second and most important is the revolution from 1956 until January 1st 1959 the third and inter-spaced during the film in black and white is 1964 where he is interviewed and speaks in front of the UN.

The film is of course in Spanish and this adds to the action, it is fast paced as it takes in two years of revolution, much of which was spent walking around mountains and laying in wait to ambush the army.

One of the best parts of the film is the [derailing of a train in Santa Clara

The film is good and I am biased as this is the area of History I specialise in but it gives a good overview of why the revolution was a success and why the people were happy for it to happen and gave help to the revolutionaries. It does not examine the politics behind Che

I watched this movie with my family yesterday. We were after something pleasant to watch with good action and a good fun and that's what we got.

The good bits were obviously seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger again. The other cast was also quite good. We have a relatively good setup at the start of the movie as it switches between the two settings (police vs county) which ultimately converge. 

There is a bit of unnecessary gore in most of the action sequences in my opinion. Lots and lots of blood and flying limbs. But

There's a bit of comedy and there also some semi-serious moments that don't just brush through death but show it fully. It makes it feel a little more real (compared to the new Die hard movie that had no thoughts on death at all).

The end sequence is fantastic and was really happy with the ending. Good old style

1369151686.0,1erpux,IJW: Gimme The Loot (2012),ben_smith_123,9,0,0,"Naturalistic comedy-drama following two Bronx teenagers over a couple of hot summer days. Malcolm (Ty Hickson) and his tomboy best friend Sophia (Tashiana Washington) spend their days graffiti-writing and sticker-bombing the city. Never receiving the recognition they deserve they hatch a harebrained scheme to tag a massive novelty apple at the Mets baseball stadium – so everyone will know the names Shakes and Sophia. But needing $500 to pay off the ground security they set about begging

At 81mins this is an incredibly short film, but it’s the characters and their relationships and interactions that make the experience so compelling. Humour effortlessly flows from the unaffected dialogue, making each scene warm and genuinely funny. Hickson and Washington are both incredibly natural, and share a chemistry that is blissful to watch. Fast talking, tripping over words and trading some exceptionally realistic digs with each other, the pair feel every bit lifelong friends. The support cast are equally adept, with newcomer Meeko as hispanic miscreant Champion getting many of the biggest laughs.

It’s refreshing to see an inner-city drama that isn’t a one dimensional morality tale told with lazy negative caricatures. Equally remarkable is how uncliched ‘Gimme The Loot’ feels, drugs – but thanks to the warmth and consideration shown to the characters it is transformed into a tender, sincere story that subverts expectations. Shot with a lo-fi aesthetic in sun-bleached pastel shades, ‘Gimme The Loot’ captures a sweltering summer's day in the city beautifully – again, it’s nice to see urban authenticity that isn’t just gritty and grim. The soundtrack is an equally uplifting mix of soul and hip-hop, encapsulating the breezy laid-back mood. A wonderful, sweet-natured, hazy memories.

1368968615.0,1emmy6,IJW: Out of Sight (1998),ben_smith_123,8,1,1,"Superior crime thriller starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Smooth talking prolific bank robber Jack Foley (Clooney) crosses paths with tough federal agent Karen Sisco (Lopez) while breaking out of prison. He and his accomplice Buddy (Ving Rhames) overpower her and they are driven to freedom – but are locked in the boot together. Sharing such a confined space for hours they develop an unlikely attraction both are unwilling to admit. Parting company

‘Out of Sight’ has so much more going for it than most run-of-the-mill manhunt movies. Director Steven Soderbergh has a real understanding of a vast spectrum of genres and is able to call on them with great effect here. The generally lighthearted tone makes it great fun, solid thriller. This erratic mood distinctively sets the film apart and keeps the journey unpredictable – as the expected formula is continually subverted, we have a vague idea of where we’re heading but the twists and turns are well concealed. Told partially with flashbacks it’s far more engaging, and ultimately satisfying, than it might have been, creating a continued degree of intrigue as the past and present narratives begin to click together. 

Much relies on the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez, and Lopez is surprisingly adept as the ballsy FBI agent – not a role you’d classically imagine her in.

Overtly a blockbuster, curious tone and characteristically for Soderbergh’s work fantastically well shot, it employs a bold colour palette that lends all the locations their own identity. An unorthodox, vastly enjoyable crime flick with real personality and intelligence.

After being disappointed by Dead Poets Society I had doubts whether or not I was right about Peter Weir as a director, be it the extraordinary sense of setting or the intricate characterizations, there is much to like about this adaptation. Of course, not having read the novel I can't make any comparisons and state whether it is truthful to it, but it also gives me the opportunity to judge it solely as a film. Weir's keen eye for the world around the characters and the way he shoots his films in a very natural way allows for the jungle to create a real sense of isolation and claustrophobia. While Mosquitia is seemingly paradise at the beginning, things start going very wrong very fast. Although the threat appears to come from the outside it becomes clear after a while what the true source of the many troubles is. The way the jungle and later on the river cause a special case of insanity and megalomaniac tendencies in the central characters reminds me slightly of Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Apocalypse Now. Allie Fox was never a particularly stable man as the start of the film indicates

Weir's films have always been about the characters and the way they interact in new, here it is an eccentric inventor from the US in the jungle of central Africa. His being there initially leads to the re-building of an entire village and the creation of a massive ice-making machine, which ominously towers above the tree-line. Although utterly fascinating in one way, Weir allows a different perspective on it and the way he shoots it makes it terrifying and almost alien. It mirrors Allie's personality and, interestingly, breaks down the same way he eventually does. The only difference being that the building collapses rather fast, while Allie breaks down slowly and gradually. Step by step losing his sanity and grip on the real world, convinces with every facet of Allie's character and has the needed presence to be actually quite scary. However, who do a tremendous job in their roles and play off Ford's character excellently.

Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast is an impressive and criminally underrated piece of work that features just about everything that makes him such an interesting and brilliant director. The drama is compelling

Bronson is a very troubled film and despite several obvious qualities simply isn't as satisfying as it should be. Refn, Hardy is let down by an otherwise confused and at times poor direction.

Although it's still a visually arresting film, never to catch it up again. Creative decisions such as the theatre scenes may sound great on paper but lack in their execution, making them exceedingly tiring each time they appear on screen. Similarly, the acts of violence and numerous fights, whilst visceral and brutal like they should be, are repetitive and numb the overall punch of the film after the 100th time. Bronson is a terrifying beast and the film does a great job at conveying that, but the lack of fresh ideas throughout and the weak pacing leave much to be desired. As a result

Yesterday, despite adoring all three of them. It never really occurred to me that I'm a huge fan of his work but apparently I am, yet having only seen three of his many films I knew I had to explore the rest of his work. When going through his filmography Dead Poets Society was one of the more striking entries to me, since it's very well-known and highly regarded. I've heard many times of the inspiriational, moving effect this film supposedly has and knowing just how affecting The Truman Show was I felt enormous excitement about it. Whether it's the wide open fields in Witness or the ferocious sea in Master and Commander, Weir has a way of really transporting audiences into a different world. It's hard to explain but his movies seemingly effortlessly suck you in and consume you.

Things felt right at the beginning and it was all set to be another spiritual experience in the way that only Weir seems to do it. However, with the exception of Robin Williams, the cast gives solid, some even excellent performances that save this film from being unbearable. Whereas each of Weir's other films I've seen is distinct in style, utterly engrossing and memorable, this just felt superficial and sickeningly manipulative. In fact, had I not known beforehand I would never have guessed that this is from the same man who gave me those wonderful memories of Truman's revelation or the construction of the house in Witness.

What looked like the perfect place to start catching up with one of my favourite director's filmography turned out to be rather off-putting and left me completely cold.

1367931136.0,1dux2r,IJW: Olympus Has Fallen (2013),ben_smith_123,8,1,1,"[Originally posted here](http://shelfheroes.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/olympus-has-fallen.html)

Fantastically well-executed action movie starring Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, The White House is infiltrated by North Korean terrorists, taking the President and his staff hostage. At this point we see a slow motion shot of a flaming, bullet-ridden American flag falling to the ground – this is about as subtle as this film gets. Instinctively springing into action, only Mike has the knowledge and skills to save lives, reclaim the building and prevent a global nuclear war. He’s disastrously failed the President before, but is it now his time to make amends?...Probably.

The violent action is phenomenally good in a brutal, knives are thrust handle-deep into necks; you really couldn’t wish for more, especially in comparison with the usual 12A watered down releases we’re subjected to. Even the exposition is solidly handled with a similar muscular swagger – it’s certainly not a film you could accuse of being over intricate. Savagely direct – much like Butler – no time is wasted over-thinking as it gets down to business and powers through 2 hours. Rapidly paced, it doesn’t slow for a second – and as the plot is constrained to The White House it feels more frenetic and dangerous, dispensing with the turgid “we need to get from point A to point B for some reason!” stuff, allowing ‘Olympus’ a consistent rhythm that never allows enjoyment levels to drop. The countless plot holes and cliches are plain as day, but with all the explosive nonsense happening on screen there's no time to stop for contemplation.

Butler doesn't have the charisma or presence of other leading men but his work always has an earnestness and enthusiasm which makes amends. He does a decent job here, and instilling a brutish physicality into every fight. He's no Bruce Willis, but even Bruce Willis isn't Bruce Willis these days. The North Koreans make for brilliant cut-throat villains who – for a change – don't fuck about, mercilessly killing hostages and agents without ceremony, literally piling up bodies on The White House lawn. In lieu of any characterisation or motive, barbaric bloodshed does a fine job of turning us against those ‘sonsabitches’.

Funny film this one. I enjoyed it, so I figured I'd give this a chance.

The visuals are really there

Acting is fantastic from Jim Sturgess and his accent really adds to the story. I feel like he made the best of the character but he couldn't hold them film up on his own. 

I'd say the film goes to hell about halfway through when it gets a bit silly and decides rather than answering questions or making it believable they'll just end a scene as is and not explain it. One scene has Adam (Jim Sturgess) in the opposite world sleeping. How did he get home? He removed the inverted materials that didn't catch fire? I believe this was before he got the heat proofing stuff so how in the hell could he get back. Another has Eden pregnant. When the hell did they have sex. HOW could they have sex. Stuff like that. 

I think the story could've continued better with the progression of the magic pollen directly through Adam rather than a side character. However the story had sort of lost it's way by then anyway so that probably wouldn't of helped it.

I believe this will be a great film with a remake. Story had potential and was wasted.

Certainly a recipe for some chaos.

Anyway, and this movie is no exception.  

Netflix calls it a ""dark comedy"", so I found myself rooting for him even though I knew he wasn't acting sensibly.  Caleb's brother is another solid choice (you can't help but feel bad for him - he's so innocent and unassuming!)

1334563518.0,sc46n,IJW Les Diaboliques (1955),OneSalientOversight,8,1,4,"Before watching this film for the first time I was completely unaware that it was a thriller film or had any knowledge of its outcome. Thus I was able to watch it first time without anything being spoiled.

There is a point somewhere in movie history when fantasy became naturalised. By this I mean that the idea that the fantastic beomes commonplace and almost expected. Les Diaboliques came from an age when this was not the case.

As I watched the film I was constantly aware of just how modern movies use fantasy as their schtick. Had LD been a modern film

Of course I was not aware of the problem until Michel Delassalle's body disappeared from the pool. Up until that point the film seemed to be about the tension of the protagonists in setting up Michel's murder and the disposal of his body. *Double Indemnity* comes to mind as a film whereby the protagonists are the bad guys trying to cover up their evil deeds and the interpersonal friction that causes.

But when the body disappears

As I watched my mind was engaged. What had happened to Michel's body? Was there someone else involved that I hadn't seen yet? Had the body disappeared down a drain somehow? This was a delight to experience and shows just how important it is for filmmakers to engage the brains of the audience and trust in their intelligence. Moreover Clouzet didn't resort to the sort of obvious hints that Hitchcock used in *Vertigo* (a film I recently viewed). Clouzet seems to trust his audience more than Hitchcock did (think of the scene in Vertigo when the camera fixes upon Kim Novak's hair

It was somewhere near the end when I finally understood what was going on. About 5 minutes before the mystery had been revealed I had worked it out myself. With a film like *The Sixth Sense* I was able to work out director Dingdong's mystery half-way through. Maybe we need more Clouzets and less Dingdongs directing thrillers?

Nevertheless I did find the solution itself to have problems. Like many of Hitchcock's films the solution itself relies upon too much that cannot be relied upon in real life. What would've happened had Christina not suffered a heart attack? What if Christina had decided to ensure Michel was dead herself by keeping his head under water or keeping his body underwater in the pool? What if she had had an attack of conscience and gone to the police to report the murder?

The other annoying part was the presence of Alfred the detective. The guy almost forces himself into the case against the will of both Christina and Nicole. The fact that he solves the case and appears at the end to arrest the bad guys was just too easy. But maybe this is just my own postmodernism coming in to play here as I would be quite satisfied with a film in which Nicole and Michel get away with it - Clouzet, perhaps he could've inserted the detective earlier into the story and let him solve it in a more realistic and less sudden manner.

It was a great film though. It got my brain going and it inserted a great mystery for the audience to ponder upon,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,t3_sc46n

1376823635.0,1klmds,IJW: Red Heat [1988],OneSalientOversight,7,0,1,"Okay. Red Heat (1988). Unless you're interested in Buddy cop films and Russian history

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a Russian police officer who goes to Chicago to bring home a Russian criminal. James Belushi plays a Chicago police officer who accompanies Arnie around town. Shenanigans ensue

This could've been a good film but ended up being quite disappointing. There was more depth to it than Twins (the other Schwarzenegger film in 1988)

In short, and the scenes in which chemistry was important ended up feeling quite forced. If Twins showed that Arnie could do comedy, Red Heat showed that there were certain comedies Arnie should not get involved in. Remember, the 80s was when Arnie moved from being a body builder into being a movie star, and films like this and Twins were attempts at broadening his appeal.

The film was produced and released in a very important time in history. The USSR had opened up with Gorbachev's Perestroika but the end of communism itself was still a few years away. Red Heat was partially filmed in Moscow, and the film's Russian language section was so badly done that it has become a so-bad-it's-good cult classic amongst Russian film buffs.

The characters themselves are not especially appealing. Arnie loses his partner at the beginning of the film and all we see is him stoically watching his funeral.  Does he really care that his partner has been killed? A touch of anger or sadness would've helped, similarly, loses a partner and good friend to the same killer, but continues to crack rude jokes, complain, swear and carry in like an idiot afterwards. Both cops shared the same pain of losing a partner to the same killer and that should've been the common ground that they could work on. I suspect scriptwriter Troy Kennedy Martin knew this, and it wouldn't have taken much to understand this concept in light of the new openness and friendliness between the US and the USSR at the time. Sadly, the opportunity was wasted. Neither character seemed to care one whit that their partners had been killed

Arnie himself looks very different in this film. He appears to have toned down his bulkiness for the Chicago scenes in the film at least

The best acting in the film was done by ""Larry Fishburne"" before he changed his first name to Laurence. Fishburne plays a broomstick-up-the-rear-end always-follow-procedure cop who hates Belushi's slackness and lack of professionalism. The problem was that Fishburne somehow added too much depth to his character. He may have been a rigid cop but his actions are quite brave and, but it almost feels as though that scene were tacked on to please some Hollywood execs out there.

I also felt that the film depicted African-Americans very poorly. This isn't me being politically correct - African Americans feature prominently in the film

Overall it feels as though this film was as a grand experiment which suffered from bad casting choices and script interference. Admittedly, Arnie's character (captain Ivan Danko) is one of the very few positive portrayals of Soviet era Russians in Hollywood history, even if Russians themselves find him hilarious.

This movie suffers from one of more common pitfalls of the horror genre in the last couple of decades: too much action, there are virtually no chances for the audience to catch its breath. In short, the pacing was too frantic.

The pace might not have been so bad were it not for the wooden acting turned in by nearly the entire cast. To be fair

Another issue I take with this movie is that the plot doesn't leave any room for a more rational fear. The producer's desire to use cutting edge special effects seems to have outweighed any concern for preserving that sense of believability that exists in horror films where the threat is (or can be construed to be) non-super natural in origin.

I love this movie because it doesn't feel like it is trying to hard. It's not overly artsy or flashy

One of my favorite things about this movie is how realistic the dialogue is. There are funny/witty conversations

I also love how unconventional the storytelling is. There isn't really a distinguishable ""conflict

Mainly what I like is the way it shows how boring and ordinary life is. It has a way of showing a dull things while the movie still has charisma. The entire movie isn't dull

William (Patrick Fugit), and Will promptly suggests covering Stillwater, and idolising the exceptionally talented guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup)

Director Cameron Crowe clearly has a deep affection for the period and its music – ‘Almost Famous’ is loosely based on his own experiences – and presents an idealised vision from a fanboy’s eye that owes more to record sleeves and posters than to real life. For a tour filled with sex, endearing and funny look at growing up and fandom. It’s not as affecting as it might be as it plays the sleazy and more troubling elements so safe, but it’s never less than thoroughly enjoyable.

Fugit does a decent job as the wide eyed wannabe writer, both aware of the debauched murky side but unwilling to look at it in any meaningful way. Fundamentally it is nostalgic and saccharine but nevertheless captures something real about the innocence of youth, and most importantly does it with a joyfully warm ride, as funny as it is touching. The 70’s were nothing like this, but who cares?

Scattered throughout the documentary are some absolutely poignant quotes (i.e. 'no morality in war', 'one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter') which whilst we have all heard before, in the context of the Israel-Palestinian situation, are given some real depth and power.

**Postives:** The actors portraying the crew were fantastic and I thought they brought a great sense of realism, (compare that with two thematically similar films: Prometheus - $130M vs Apollo 18's $5M), I think they did amazing things with the budget and time constraint they had.

**Greatest Strength:** I think though this film's greatest strengths are its respect to the subject matter -the realism in not only technology, where the best of humanity's scientists touch and taste there way through the foreboding alien planet. I'd like to think a special nod to that occurs in scene where Dr. Katya says, ""I wish I could take one of these gloves off and touch the ice."" Where then a crew member immediately replies with, ""Please don't.""

**Negatives:** Though the crew in space are competently acted, Embeth Davidtz and Dan Fogler, really took me out of the realism with there often over the top and cliche performances. Also I found myself often times chronologically lost. Though the director does a great job of knowing that often times less is more, by the time there is the [big creature reveal, I found it to be anti-climactic, maybe it the fact that nothing was hinted to us as what to expect or maybe it was just me and watching too many monster/creature movies but I felt the ""endboss"" design could have been much more alien and fantastic.](/spoiler)

There is much more tension than lets say Apollo 18 because there is depth. And as a sci-fi film, rooting you in complete realism throughout the majority of the film. It doesn't do a single thing new however, and you can almost guess what happens in the film just by thinking of all the other similar films of this genre. 

**I'd give it a 6.5/10 for regular viewers

I've seen a lot of offensive films in my time, offensive, unpleasant films I have ever seen. Yet somehow it is also riveting, like watching a car crash unfold in slow motion. Several times I was on the verge of turning it off in sheer disgust, but found myself holding off, just to see how much more depraved it could get. 

The ""plot"", to conduct a ""inquest"" into slavery. Presenting itself as a condemnation of slavery, it instead revels in the unpleasantness, delivering atrocity upon atrocity with a smirk on it's face. The horror inflicted on the slaves in Django Unchained pales in comparison to the never-ending parade of unpleasantries served up here. I suppose it does present a view of what slaves went through at the time, but it's hard to feel that they are condemning the acts when all the slaves are presented as little more than dumb animals. 

Amongst the dubious ""delights"" on offer are rape

It's certainly unforgettable, even if it's just to see how low Italian exploitation cinema managed to stoop. You might need a good shower afterwards, however.

1373631746.0,1i5d5m,IJW: A Prophet (2009),ben_smith_123,9,3,7,"Meditative prison drama following Malik’s (Tahar Rahim) 6 years in prison. 19 years old with seemingly no direction, César (Niels Arestrup)

Utilising all the tension and machismo of the genre this is a captivating underdog story told with the familiarity of convention – but it effortlessly radiates something far more spiritual that elevates it above a mere prison drama. Malik remains untouched by religion, forever changing the lives of those he comes into contact with. This transient, confident figure bears little relation to the fragile boy we first met, but regardless of his transformation a surreal spectre of his past wrongdoing continually haunts him, a reminder of his vulnerability and mortality. Tahar Rahim is exceptional as Malik producing a performance that embodies the character’s naivety and vulnerability with an underlying steely determination and focus. He lives an entire life inside, and sharing this journey makes the film compelling – he remains an enigma, but having watched him suffer such hardships in the first movement he retains our undying sympathy. 

Shot with a realist eye that captures the sweaty claustrophobic intensity of prison life, but it’s undeniably stirring and capable of eliciting a feeling beyond words. The sheer clarity of Audiard's directorial vision is what makes ‘A Prophet’ such a special film – revelling in the hallmarks of the prison genre, but shaping Malik’s odyssey into something of transcendent beauty that is both equivocal and utterly fulfilling.

★★★★★

Well, until the end of this review, it'd be more accurate to say IAW Olympus Has Fallen, so this review will probably be very stream-of-consciousness-y as I give my thoughts at various points in the movie.

* ~10 minutes in: So that introduction was confusing. All I can really gather is that the First Lady died, isn't he?

* ~0:15: Ah

* 0:25: Finally some action! Interestingly, the whole scene felt like it was trying to bring up memories of 9/11 with all the [scenes of the plane swooping near buildings and destruction of the Washington Monument.](/spoiler). Also, this is the movie **not** directed by Roland Emmerich? White House Down must feature DC being turned into a crater then.

* 0:30: This movie just became a CoD fight. Someone just got an 11 kills kilstreak. Come on

* 0:32: I don't think these terrorists or North Koreans really have a gameplan here. If the goal was to assassinate the president, as looks likely, if they're trying to take him to somewhere that isn't likely to be stomping with the military within the hour, then how on earth would they do that since DC would've become a no-fly zone as soon as the first plane had shot our guys?](/spoiler) 

* 0:33: There's that military I expected.

* The more I watch

* 0:37: [Title Drop](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop)! Take a drink!

* 0:39: [Dylan McDermott is a bad guy?](/spoiler) This is my completely unsurprised face.

* 0:40: They keep trying to make me feel something. Maybe it's because my suspension of disbelief was destroyed 10 minutes ago.

* 0:42: Was just reminded of the annoying kid again. Followed by a unnecessary scene of some hospital.

* 0:46: Ok, [to stop Koreans from starving.](/spoiler) My suspension of disbelief needs booze to come back.

* 0:48: Ah

* 0:51:

 What? No. The blood is on the hands of whoever kills a person. In this case

&gt; The US doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

Yet another bingo square.

* 1:25: And the East Wing is down!

* 1:27: Talking back to Morgan Freeman? That's a paddlin.

* 1:32: And there's the daily dose of narm.

* 1:44: Spartan Batman made through on his promise.

* 1:50: Now that the movie's over, giving a sense of patriotism and MURICA, FUCK YEAH!, and on the front, it does it well.

 In this movie

This is one of Stanley Kubrick's most famous films. It is a hilarious black comedy that satirizes the fear of nuclear war and shows what happens when patriotism goes too far. It is full of over-the-top performances especially by Sterling Hayden as the insane General Ripper and George C. Scott as the hilarious General Trugidson.

1371549440.0,1gkr5y,IJW: The Iceman (2012),ben_smith_123,9,2,6,"Dark biographical drama starring Michael Shannon as notorious mob hitman Richie Kuklinski who reportedly killed over 100 people during the 1970's. Working a stable – but seedy – job in a porn production lab Richie already has a dark side to hide when he begins dating his eventual wife, sometimes in anger – whilst becoming tangled in a web of mob politics and deceit that begins to threaten his family.

Shannon’s central performance is exceptional and justifies the price of admission alone – smouldering with intense menace, seldom likeable but always captivating.

In its attempt to chart such a vast length of time there is never really a strong enough narrative to tie ‘The Iceman’ together, but individually there are countless moments of dark thrilling brilliance that are separately powerful enough to keep you engaged.

Along with Shannon’s brooding Kuklinski the support cast are all exceptional, van and all. ‘The Iceman’ has its flaws but a slew of fine actors turning in solid performances in every scene make it eminently watchable. 

Visually the 1970’s are stylishly recreated in washed-out colours and well-observed details, with something authentically sordid at its heart.

Soderbergh is a director I find myself drawn to in a weird way. I've now seen three of his films, never stood out to me as particularly great, and yet I still find him to be interesting. His direction is conventional and lacks certain characteristics that make different directors distinguishable from each other. He has a way of just pointing the camera at things and letting the setting and actors do the work. Like with his other work, Behind the Candelabra is a fairly plain film, despite the opulence of Liberace's shows and living circumstances. It's far less indulgent than one would expect from a film that revels in wealth and glamour as much as this, and while I quite dig that it also works against it in a way.

Matt Damon and particularly Michael Douglas are good in their respective roles, the duo is a joy to watch and boost the entertainment factor infinitely. In a way they completely carry the movie, as with the exception of the set and costume design, I can't help but feel the whole affair is slightly bland, nor did I ever truly feel emotionally invested with either of the characters. It's a story worth telling but I'm not sure whether Soderbergh was the right choice for it. He's too calculated and cold as a director to pull something like this off. In the end, Behind the Candelabra is interesting and moderately entertaining but also a missed opportunity.

Howard Hawks' white-knuckle, but for many reasons I think it's both much more interesting and superior to the remake. At 90 minutes it is roughly half the running time of the 80s version, and the pace is accordingly high. It moves at the same speed as the many bullets fired during it, and like its many drive-by shootouts flies by the screen, giving you not a moment to breathe. Its no non-sense and brutal approach to the source material is shocking for a film of its time, the visceral gunfights still packing quite a punch after all these decades.

Of course, whereas Hawks' production was quite daring, and its violent escapades are still exhilarating to watch. At the center of the film is the charismatic but ruthless Tony Camonte, excellently played by Muni, whose rise to success within organized crime and eventual downfall is depicted as brisk as the duration of a drive-by. Despite coming up short in running time Muni's Tony is much more rounded and menacing than Pacino's. It's also told in a far more personal manner, making the climax actually very emotional. Muni comes off as much more natural and human than I remember Pacino being.

Howard Hawks' Scarface is exciting

Visually arresting, deserted roads, birds of prey, cellular photography – the quick cutting between this ever-changing collage delivers an emotive experience – but one that is far too vague to convey the desired themes of race, religion and love. Stylistically it has been shown a great deal of attention, but the script and more typical exposition elements feel neglected and markedly televisual, which jars with the inventive beauty and unpredictability of the photography. With no ‘scene’ lasting longer than a few minutes (frequently less) the intriguing core conceit is never able to captivate or move in the way it might.

‘Piercing Brightness’ is a work of art. To judge it as a feature feels harsh, it will be fascinating to see what he produces in the future as he learns his trade as a storyteller.
