I remember getting into guitar gadgets when I was a meaty

Aaron Pill of The Appleseed Cast.  One of my favorite guitarists.
This photo's pretty damn old too.
I probably watched hundreds of YouTube videos about the pedal.  I had to have it...so the antagonizing began.  I was relentless and I never stopped talking my mother into buying it for me.  After over a year of unsuccessful murder attempts my mom plotted against me, making whale sounds, and creating god awful feedback!  I used it in every band I've ever played in.  At one point (during a heavy Minus the Bear phase) I had borrowed a second one and had both on my board.

No.  The DL4 does not have the best sounding delay, Moog 104M, and I loved my DMM (before Howard Davis f*&amp;#ed me over).  But like these other famous units, nothing else sounds quite like it.  It's not a pristine clean sounding digital delay, it has some quirks.  However, I've had phases where I just flat out didn't want to use it anymore because it was ""outdated"", I didn't have the $$$ to mod it, promising all of the features of the DL4 but better!  I quickly acquired these devices, these new units never really offered more realistically usable features than the DL4 did.  

My DL4 had burnt out once previously.  I used it for 8 years, I decided to bust it out again.  Plugged it in.  Lights came on.  Abnormally flashed a few times.  Then nothing.  I tried different cables.  I double checked the owners manual to my new power supply I've bought since the last burnout.  I tried a different power supply.  Nothing.  I've read on all the forums about static under the chip, hard resets, yada yada.  I've tried it all, it's toast.  I'm well beyond my warranty on it.  Another $80 doesn't sound too appealing.  So I feel like it's time to retire it.  (Unless someone wants to fix it up free :D  )  

Now I'm in a weird situation I haven't been in for years


R.I.P. my little green friend.

I didn't even realize this was a sub. I built this board about 6 or 7 years ago and haven't moved away from it since.

[Picture of the pedal board.](http://i.imgur.com/ec3lohO.jpg)

I play guitar mainly by myself (no band) so I wanted to find a way to add some ""depth"" to my playing. So what I've built is a David Gilmour inspired pedal board.

The idea is that I use left side of the board to do volume swells while I use the right side of the board to solo over the swells

So what I've got is a Morley A/B switch separating two pedal setups. I can play them independently or together.

The ""Left"" side runs: Morley A/B Switch &gt; Ernie Ball Stereo Volume Pedal &gt; Boss DD-6 Delay &gt; Boss BF-2 Flanger &gt; Amp

The ""Right"" side runs: Morley A/B switch &gt; Dunlop Crybaby Wah &gt; Boss DD-3 Delay &gt; Rocktron Rampage Distortion &gt; Amp

Also on the pedal board is the foot switch channel selector for my amp, ""Drive"" or ""More Drive"" on both channels.

Like I said before

This is a comparison of these two power supplies with various noisy pedals.  I tracked the max volume in my sound editor and have the following results.

The numbers represent the max volume during the wave recording.  These numbers are all negative numbers so the closer to zero they are

In general

No, but probably not enough to justify the higher price (they tend to go for ~40 more on Ebay).

I used the Y splitter cables only because I needed them to power my pedals so I wanted them in on the comparison.

One more thing... all the noises are generated using the bridge pickup in single coil mode with the tone at 10 (trying to get as much noise as possible).

*  The pedals came in the mail extremely fast. I think it took at most four business days from order to arrival at my door.

* Of the five pedals ordered (Joyo's vintage overdrive, flanger and equalizer) two of them were replaced with pedals I hadn't ordered (vintage overdrive and flanger were replaced by ultimate drive and california sound)

* The pedals themselves are pretty decent. Of the five I tried, plus the LED's are awesome) but the Voodoo Octave is lacking in its ""octave"" function and cuts away a lot of low end and the compressor definitely has its issues as well.

Has anyone had a similar quest and tried one or even two of these options to compare them? The qualifiers for a different selection are:
a)ability to set a scale

The only new pedals for me are the JHS Mini Foot Fuzz and the Wampler Ego compressor (replaced my Keeley comp)


Here's the rundown:


**This1smyne 8-loop true bypass looper with the following:**

* TC Electronics Polytune Mini
* Wampler Ego compressor
* JHS Mini Foot Fuzz
* Mad Professor Little Green Wonder
* Caroline Wave Cannon
* Wampler Ecstasy
* JHS Morning Glory (likely going to be replaced with a JHS Superbolt soon)
* Paul C Timmy

**After the looper comes:**

* T1M buffer (under the board)
* Ernie Ball volume pedal
* Strymon Ola
* Empress tremolo
* Strymon Timeline (with a T1M mini expression knob)
* Strymon BlueSky


The board is a Pedaltrain 3 and everything is powered with a pair of CIOKS DC-10's. All of the cables going into and out of the looper are from the Lava solder-free cable kit and then there a few Mogami cables connecting the rest.


One cool feature is that I have a little patchbay box (yet another piece made by T1M) that comes after the volume pedal,False,self,t5_2r0bp,False,,,t3_13d8gz

* reverse polarity connectors?

My guitars are a Fender CP Jazzmaster, and I'm running through a Hot Rod Deluxe (if any of that makes a difference.)

I don't mind a pedal that adds some top end

My ideas right now:

1. Xotic SP Compressor (~$130)- I like the idea of a blend control and the small shape

2. Barber Tone Press ($160) - Parallel comp similar to the SP. Again the blend control is nice

3. Walrus Audio Deep Six ($200) - Mostly because I have their Mayflower OD and it's the best pedal on my board

4. Strymon OB.1 ($200) - Again the company has a great reputation

5. Diamond Compressor (~$210) - People seem to throw this around a lot as a great compressor. EQ seems like a good control to have. Also

Budget-wise, reviews, and internet word of mouth. 

Anyone have experience with these pedals and  a suggestion of which one I should go for? Or is there something else I should be looking at?

Any of you familiar with this pedal will understand why as it has a very loud volume boost when engaged, poking out of the dryout hole on the side.
So where to start, before I go into my humble theory/plan of action for you guys to review/critic, here is the schematics for said pedal:

[WH10v2 Schematics](http://www.dirk-hendrik.com/temp/wh10_v2.pdf)

So the new pot will have 3 lugs, and lug 2 would go to the last component before the output jack? (lug 2 is what throws me off)  So if that is true, would that mean lug 2 would go to the R30 before the output jack, effectivly bypassing the signal through the new pot to the output?  Luckily I have a friend who will help me out and is generally good with these things for the hands on portion, but I want to make sure i don't screw up to badly.

so to recap my questions:
where do I make my connections for the lugs? (see schematic)
Will gutting out the dry components have any negative effect?
Anything else I should know?

It's almost definitely not my rig, as I run some pretty heavy fuzz/distortion already and there are no pops/crackles. Not to mention that I changed rigs/isolated the pedal testing it. Could it just be the nature of the circuit? I find that hard to believe, too. Could I have just been unlucky enough to get 2 bad pedals in a row? Harder to believe still. 

Do you have this pedal? Does it backsass you like it does me? What would you do if you were me?

Thanks in advance.

PS: In the process of returning the first pedal, and then forgot to send me a postage sticker. So I called for like a week after, when they finally picked up it took them a while to figure out that they forgot to send me one. And then it took them 2 weeks to call me to tell me that I was being stupid and that the pedal was fine, at which point I had to call back (a few days later because they wouldn't pick up) and ask them to send a new one anyway.

Does anyone have any alternatives or suggestions? Sound clips would be a plus! 

If not

Would it be worth getting a few now and using them with my current amps (I will get to those in a second)??  Or wait a while to get the amp first?   

The amps:  **VOX Pathfinder 10.**  Little practice amp

**Fender Mustang III.**  The guys from Fender seem to say it is OK.   Obviously using a dirty setting then adding a distortion pedal is gonna be clip city


Last amp

Never used any pedal with with amp.  I have read some forum posts that say it works.  Originally they advised not using external effects with that amp.  

So that is that I have for now...

I want a simple, Metal Muff, Bad Monkey (might splurge for a more expensive OD)Small Clone, Holy Grail, Tuner, Crybaby and maybe a compressor.

However, but I think overall it would be a great idea, considering I have a list of pedals that I'd like to buy in the future that could all be satisfied with the M9 as well.

So now for some questions...first off

For anyone that does have either an M9 or M13, what do you find it lacks that you use outside pedals for?

In my preliminary brainstorm

* another delay

* a volume pedal (and an EXP for the M9)

* a looper (I know it has one

* maybe keep my BD-2 or Muff...the M9 has plenty of dirt selections

I think that in the long run

Another question for users...how is the durability? I'd hate to invest in it and sell off back up pedals only to have it break and me be left with nothing.

So, what I would do is put a good OD before it, maybe a dirt or fuzz (Always wanted a Fuzz Factory, but since it sucks on bass, could never justify it), and maybe one of these Boss Fender amp imitator pedals after everything (since I don't have the money for a good Fender amp). 
Would all this setup be a good idea? Or maybe getting the ME-20 is a bad move?
