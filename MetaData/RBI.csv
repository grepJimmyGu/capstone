In regards to suspicions helicopter parents are still not ruled out

Law enforcement is unlikely

The simcard is currently in an old phone but no phone calls yet. I'll provide any updates on that front in here.

Any more suggestions are welcome

Thanks for the comments everyone!

**UPDATE** 

I called and an automated message said ""the service is now closed and if you have voicemail you can turn it on and ......... "" nothing interesting - didnt get the last number called in

I created an account on the 02 website and the only information i got is that there have been no top-ups in the last three months

I called 02 and they said that they could not give me the incoming call log

Also how does the six months no outgoing call charges means deactivation of sim work?
As I left for uni at the beginning of October and its now May

Around 9 p.m., reading the paper with my great grandmother.  An argument ensued, ending with my grandfather shooting the man, point blank with a shot gun, killing him.

The man had introduced himself as Chester Stotts.  But, a paper driver’s license).  He did have a social security card with the name Chester Otis Stotts.  He had spoken of a wife and two daughters.  And, it also believed that he came from Kentucky, Indiana or Missouri.  Law Enforcement were not able to find anything viable, so the man was buried in a unmarked grave in our community cemetery.   My father would later place a tombstone on the grave with the only name we knew “Chester Otis Stotts”.  In addition, he and my mother would make regular trips to Missouri, Kentucky or Indiana in hopes of tracking down his family (this is before the internet age). They did this up until their deaths 4 years ago.  

Now, that had a male member go missing in 1959.  I know this took place a long time ago, and it’s possible this man’s immediate family has passed, but it would be nice to get some closure.

And for the record, but I can continue his search for the family.

I believe her name was Dusty or Destiny I think she was a step daughter
I know Dusty or Destiny attended Antelope Valley High School for a while. 
The other 2 girls were about 4 years old and 6 years old if I remember correctly. Marty worked in Aerospace in Palmdale CA. 

Here is what I remember about that evening:
I was in my parent's back yard working out, I grabbed a couple fire extingushers from my parents kitchen and ran over next door.

The front door was unlocked to I ran in and went down the hall and the older sister was crouched down in the corner of the hallway
I entered the little girls room fire was coming from under the bed up the wall and over the ceiling. 
I looked around the room but it was so smokey and dark and the only bright light was from the flames
I reached over and picked them up
I then went back into the house and started swipping the fire with the first extingusher until it ran out
I jumped out of the window mostly because I needed air
By this time the fire department started to pull up and started treatment on the girls, stubble on my face, neck and some of hair on my head were burned off. 

A few days later I found out that the 2 little girls were playing with a candle under their bed. 
Marty was upset that I broke out the window that he wanted my dad to pay for the replacement
Shortly after the fire they moved away. I would just like to know how the girls ended up in life and if they remember that evening at all. I am sure the older sister does. About a year after the fire I moved away from home.

Things were going okay until we started talking about sexual preferences, and lastly, and to quote her ""U want ta fuck my daughter?"".


When I responded negatively to the above, not being sure if she was serious or not. However, she kept bringing it up: asked me to tell her incest stories; suggesting I should try underage; asking me what sorts of things I would do to her daughter. In the process she also told me that her daughter is 10 years old.


I declined to answer any of those


I tried not to think about it much at the time. I thought that maybe I should do something about it, when they actually live in a surrounding town or county). I only had her phone number, which has an out of state area code. I didn't know if I was being trolled, or if it was just a fake profile setup by some creep. I also wouldn't want to give my phone to the police for evidence or whatever because there are pictures/etc of drugs/paraphernalia on there (trees and such) which might get me in trouble. I had also admitted in my texts to her that I do certain drugs and whatnot. Anyway, going to the police didn't seem like a good idea at the time, so I just tried to forget the whole experience.


But now its starting to eat at my conscience and feel like I should do something it; what if there really is a 10 year old girl out there whose being abused by her mother in this manner?


What should I do? The only concrete personal information that I have about her is her phone number (which I will not post on here). I also have the entirety of our text conversation still on my phone. I think that she probably really does live in my area and I'm pretty sure that she really is 26


I thought about simply sending an anonymous email to my local police department with the information that I have


TL;DR A woman I met online wanted me to abuse her daughter


What should I do reddit? Do you think this could even be real?


**UPDATE**: 
I contacted the central police department in my area electronically and explained my situation to them. I'm awaiting their reply so I can send them the information I have. Thanks for all the responses everyone.

After beating her to death while her 2 kids slept in the next room they took most of her belongings and children's toys and spent the night selling the items door to door in the shelter (most of these items were recovered by police). A neighbor stated she had seen these 3-4 men harassing her for her food stamps outside of the shelter earlier in the week. 

Police did a slap shot job in the investigation bc she was a homeless woman in a shelter. The scene was contaminated by unloved investigators and no reliable fingerprints were ever lifted. After beating her to death they stuffed her mouth with narcotics in an attempt to make her death seem drug related. Her tox screen was clean at autopsy.

Security footage only showed men in dark hoodies repeatedly entering/leaving her apartment to sell her belongings while her body laid in the apartment living room in full view of the hall and anyone who may pass.

W/O a doubt these were drug addicts. I'm hoping at some point they bragged about their crime to someone, a tattoo of her name on her upper arm, large gap in front top teeth and very large chested. Her chest was how ppl knew her lol. 

Any info or even similar cases in the Queens burough is greatly appreciated. 

**EDIT** Thank you all for your advice and kind words. I realize how long ago this was

I think it's important to know (NY'ers might recall this) that around 2002-2003 the Social Services Offices in NYC got into a lot of trouble for having women and families sleeping IN the offices; under desks and on benches. Ilisha was the woman who broke this to several local news affiliates after sleeping in a bathroom with her kids. Arnold Diaz's ""Shame On You"" responded to her plea first and the city was forced to step up and put these ppl in cheap roach motels. Ilisha was told by her case manager that the City was unhappy with her (she did an interview about her experience) and any further ""trouble"" and they would find a reason to delay/reject her benefits. I can't help but feel this played into the slap shot investigation. What I mean is, who's items were sold door to door (on video!) yet no one who purchased these items could recall a single detail of what the men looked like would peak SOME reporters interest. 

I even contacted Arnold Diaz, is it?"" I want to note, at the time I was 100% confident and cooperative with the police. They weren't interested that I spoke to her on the phone about an hour b4 her time of death. They also weren't interested in the fact that her son had gotten up to use the bathroom and witnessed the men arguing with his mother. They didn't even ask him for a description! They never spoke to the security guard at the front desk who buzzed them in. They did next to nothing.

The neighbor who discovered her kids eating cereal next to her body in the morning and called the police told me how the first officers to arrive touched everything w/o gloves and even rolled her body before a detective or coroner was at the scene. Some of the pills fell out of her mouth and an officer said ""Shit."" and stuffed them back in. I don't want anyone to think I don't trust law enforcement just bc her case is unsolved

Now this last part is the most outrageous and suspicious. When her Aunt got the death certificate it was marked ""Suicide"" but the ""Method"" area was left blank. We got the autopsy report and waited 6 hours to speak to the man who conducted the autopsy. We asked how she committed suicide? How did she break her own jaw, crack her own skull in 2 places, cause internal bleeding from several major organs, rip a chunk outta her own scalp then stuff pills in her mouth but not swallow them? He took the certificate and report and had security escort us out (we were not being belligerent, threatening, etc). A week later a new death certificate was issued with cause of death listed as ""Homicide"". We had been clear that were going to send his report to another coroner for a second opinion if he didn't answer our questions, instead he simply reissued. I think he was pressured to close this case for the police.

How do I know these men were addicts? Several neighbors willing to talk to me away from the shelter explained that for months residents had been complaining about these men smoking crack and leaving crack pipes in the shelters courtyard where the children played (its enclosed by the building and you need to pass thru the building to reach the courtyard). They had also been in several scrapes with ppl over food stamps and drugs. Now Ilisha had been fighting for extra food stamps from the City and one of the neighbors who spoke to me told me one of the men involved had overheard her telling a friend in front of the shelter that she had finally been approved and they were even giving her extra food stamps going back to when she first filed for the increase. This man approached her and started asking if he could buy some of her food stamps and when she said no he became belligerent and a passerby had to restrain him while she got her kids inside. This was not the first time one of these men had had altercations with shelter residents over buying/selling benefits. Therefore I'm confident these were crack addicts (the neighbor referred to them as ""crackheads"").

I never came across anyone in the building who was questioned by police except the woman who found her body. Not one. The detective never denied not interviewing anyone and often wouldn't even return calls. My best friend of 15yrs was nothing but another homeless woman to them. When the City wanted to put her in a cardboard box and drop her in a paupers grave I came up with the $$$ for a proper casket, but I have hope that if I throw out enough hooks ill get something eventually. At some point one or all of these men have probably been to jail/prison. Even if an ex-con recalls hearing a similar story I'm willing to listen. Heard some druggie on the corner talking? Ill listen. You get away with such a horrific and blatant crime, chances are good that at some point you're gonna open your mouth.

A few months back I was attacked by 5 teens from 14-17 years old.  The reason I was attacked was for asking them to put out a fire without getting them in trouble for drinking.  [pics of my recover](http://imgur.com/a/d1SAz)

I was beaten so badly and left for dead.  The only reason I am alive today is due to kind people that helped me out of the woods.

They all had records before this for drinking and fighting.  They are all drinking again and posting pictures to facebook of themselves drinking/smoking in woods again.  I have contact the DA about them doing this again yet they still seem to walk without even losing a step.  With in one of the papers recieved the judge at the pretrail thing said they were not to use facebook and have no contact with each other

Only one got raised up to an adult which is the only one that is getting a decent sentence

I have a civil lawyer

I am just wondering what if anything I can do to make these peoples lifes just a little more crappy since it seems that they got such a light sentence.  So far everyone pleaded guilty

* hire a PI to follow them around.  3 are out and the costs might be unfeesable.

* contact the PO's.  (don't have anyway to know who they are)

*  call 911 with a burner in the woods where they go.  (good idea in theory but I can't go in the woods anymore)

Casio fixed the projector, and explicitly didn't require a signature. They sent it back to me during the holiday season. I do not have this in my possession. Obviously, SOMEONE stole it. I don't care about WHO stole it, I believe that Fed Ex or Casio is to blame. I should have had to sign for it, and/or I should have been notified that it was coming back. I would have worked from home had I known I was getting my baby (try playing Guitar Hero on a 1080p projector) back and it was going to be no sign. required. Why would Casio send me a $1,000 item back during the holiday season and NOT require a signature? Moronic.


I put in a claim to Casio (who put in a claim to Fed Ex)

This is bullshit. My SO and I want some justice. I would like my projector back

Reddit: Please tell me what to do to get some justice. I can't let this one slip through the cracks. Are there magical words I can speak to Casio to get my projector replaced (they still sell it)? Should I take them to small claims court? Do I take this up with Fed Ex even though they have refused to talk to us about the matter?

TL;DR sent in broken projector (in the warrantee period) to Casio, stolen from me (never took possession), now neither Fed Ex or Casio are doing anything about it. What do I do?

1371080391.0,1g8d1z,I'm Being Stalked. What do I do (x-post from /r/AskReddit),imbeingstalkedhelp,119,25,58,"I'm an immigrant to the U.S. and I met my future-husband in 2006 and we got hitched in 2010. After we got married, I got a boyfriend.

I joined a dating site in early 2013, and then due to my unresolved past, he decided to end things with me.
Fast forward to April. Al randomly texts me professing his love and desire to be with me forever. At this point, I noticed my car tires were slashed, and my license plate stolen. Ironically enough, I get a call the very same morning from Al inquiring how I'm doing, etc. I explain I'm not doing so well due to the car, and he offers his help with my car. Being a damsel in distress, I accept his offer to help me with my car trouble, etc. Because I was very stressed

After our casual hook up, and ignoring my requests to be left alone (I didn't want a relationship). One day, I received a 5 page letter addressed to the U.S. Immigration Department, in detail, outlining numerous false accusations stating my initial marriage was bullshit (fraud/federal crime). Although false, these accusations could lead to me being deported and my husband being sent to federal prison. The conditions he offered for not sending the letter would be for me to date him and have a family with him. Although I could prove these allegations are false, it would cost a lot of money, etc. and I don't really want to make more trouble for myself (i.e. my husband and I are separated. I don't want the govt. looking into it anyways). Al also told me that if he couldn't have me

As days went by and I didn't respond to his threats, state, or country, he would always follow me until I agreed to his conditions. He would randomly come to my apartment and sit on the doorstep awaiting my arrival. He would post things on my social media accounts, tag me in creepy pictures, message me with threats, the most threatening one being he would follow me until one of ""us"" dies.
Around this point, I grew more paranoid because throughout the day I would receive non-stop text messages from him accusing me of lying to him (in general) and telling me he knew where I was at that exact time. More paranoia sets in and even when driving on the interstate, I couldn't stop looking around me out of fear he was following me. Taking my friend's advice, I ended up going to the police and getting the documentation needed for a restraining order. I filled it out and turned it in.

The next day, Al got a restraining order against me, telling the police everything he did to me I did to him. Another surprise was that the person who handed me the restraining order papers handed me the wrong papers and the restraining order was never filed. On top of all this, Al told the police I was unstable and was threatening to commit suicide. As it is in many states, accusations like this are not taken lightly and when the police came and got me from my apartment, I was taken to the mental institution (in handcuffs) for a 72 hour psych-evaluation.

When I got out today,"" he has continued to message me on my social media accounts telling me to put everything he has done in the past and begs me to start a family with him.
I've had to re-do my restraining order paperwork

First of all I have large gaps in my memory I believe to be associated with various childhood traumas. One of these gaps covers most of first grade (1995, but they've always acted very odd about the subject. They're still acting strange about it almost twenty years later and I'm starting to suspect Cecilia might have been murdered.

Around the time she stopped coming to school there was an incident where a man with a gun tried to get me and a friend to get in his car. Thankfully my big sister intervened and we ran to my house where my Mom called the police. 

I don't remember if Cecilia was with us too, the last thing I remember is my mother on the phone with 911.

All of this happened in Denver, and was average height and weight for her age. No glasses or other identifying characteristics. The man I saw at the park was tan, possibly Latino, heavyset, and pimpled. He drove a dented blue car. He had dark eyes and I think he had a sparse mustache, but I'm not sure. He had some kind of hand gun.

So far I haven't been able to find an obituary or much of anything else in the newspaper archives. Someone in my original offmychest thread found an article that might be related--the Cecilia in that case attended a different school and died two years later than I believe this happened

My father is a teacher in his late 70s, so the possibility that a European company would reach out to my father wouldn't be out of the ordinary. My father's role was to purchase large quantities of technical equipment from the US and send them to Europe. Yes, alarm bells should have been going off, but it was more insidious. After a series of training tests, communications with the company (over email and phone), my father was to make his first three purchases for a total of $25,000. The company required him to purchase a dozen expensive laptops through their bank account in order to make payments on his credit cards

He made a total of three purchases

I have their website URL but all the registry info looks fake. The credit companies have determined that my father owes the amounts in full. His lawyer and a lawyer friend of mine have confirmed that he has no legal leg to stand on. My father will likely be declaring bankruptcy shortly.

**TLDR; A company forwarded my father $25

Not sure if anything can be done. I have the company's URL, and addresses. But it's probably all fake. My parents have contacted multiple lawyers, various US fraud agencies, and their states' attorney general to report the scam.

There's enough evidence so far to attract the FBI and the state's attorney general (they investigate claims of tax related fraud)

This morning I ran across court documents describing how the US government sued a man with the same name as our current city manager 10 years ago for doing essentially the same thing he's doing now.

I'm about 90% sure the two people are one and the same

**Update - June 26:** 

The mayor of the town in question was elected after the city manager was hired. He's also a former city police chief. When asked if the current city manager was the same one involved in the IRS fraud, that's not proof enough, at least not enough for me. It is enough to motivate me to continue digging for the link.

Interesting, where he went to school, when and where he bought homes and sold homes, and more. If it's public information, I have it. I actually feel a bit creepy, and certainly more aware now of my ""trail"". 

The most interesting part for me (and maybe obvious to others) is how he goes ""silent"" during the big scandal years.

I had my wallet, cash, and personal phone in my pocket.

Info I have:

* Out of State text only phone number of girl doing the deal with me
* Local number of friend/brother's cell phone she was reluctant to use
* Her personal email address she replied from on craigslist
* Maybe her facebook page from that

The police said it's a slow process and they have to subpoena phone records of suspects and such. So my first question would be

**[Edit 1]** **Let me clarify that by 'not helping' I mean:**

* I gave them the perps personal info on a silver platter. 
* The craigslist ad was up from the 23rd (when it happened) all the way to last night and they could have attempted to meet with them. 
* They could create false facebook friends but they said they were unsure about doing that.
* They could have reviewed the tapes with the GM when she was there reviewing them for me
* They could have taken witness testimonies of people who saw it happen
* 
I don't care about my work phone

**[Edit 2]** **If I post their personal information....**

Can I be **100% SURE** that no one is going to herp de derp and go link them to this thread? Or do something stupid like message ""Gotcha"" to them? Or blow up their phones with text so they turn them off before we can get more info? I don't need a thug with a gun showing up on my doorstep. Nor do we need to inadvertently lower the chances of them getting caught :P

Anyhow I need advice on how I might locate the guitar. My cousin has several warrants but is yet to be caught. in fact he can't even be charged with this theft because there is no evidence. At this point I just want my guitar back. It means everything to me and I'll even pay to get it back. I assume he probably sold it at a pawnshop. He definitely didn't take it to Grandmas Music and sound because I used to work there. In fact one of my old co workers was using that guitar to record

This car followed my friend home for 15+ miles

edit for clarity on how we know the car was following him: At one point early in the video my friend is stopped at a busy/big intersection, 3 continue straight and one right hand turn lane), you see the car behind him while he's stopped, but then my friend decides to take a different route home so he cuts across the lane to his right (which is a few cars deep, so he gets across by squeezing through a gap of the stopped cars), but yet the Kia manages to catch up to my friend down the street when he catches another red light. I know this is kind of confusing but it's the most telling part of the video showing that he was 99.9% followed by the car.
The point where I took the screenshot is at 14:35 in the video

I need to recover the craigslist posting to present in court.,HeathenChem84,76,14,75,"So my cousin never printed out the ad and communicated with this lady over the phone. Here's the link where the ad used to be: http://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/cto/3374730848.html. 

Here's a little bit of the back story:

They talked on the phone

The seller showed up, my cousin paid this amount and told the rep (at the window) she would rather pay $7 for new license plates so there's no confusion with any future tolls.  Signed paperwork and left the office. 
They agreed that my cousin would take the car she had to rent in order to meet the lady at the tax assessor's office so she could drop it at Enterprise and the seller would drive the VW to Enterprise (About 3 miles).

At the parking lot (of Enterprise)

My cousin paid for the rental car and came back and the seller asked if my cousin wanted to drive. She said the seller could drive herself home  (since she knew the way) and that my cousin would bring back the car. Seller drives the car

The seller pulled in front of her house (she thinks) and got out. They said bye to each other and my cousin drove back home. 

The next morning my cousin started looking for the inspection report (that the seller showed) to take it to someone to inspect because she could smell something burning (which had actually been discussed with the seller earlier as well but was blamed on a new oil change). This is when my cousin realized it was missing so after work she drove it to the dealership (the one she had originally wanted to take the car to) and there they took over two hours and told her the car was in bad shape

Devastated

She called the Firestone in the seller's hometown asking them for a copy of the inspection report that was done on a VW recently. They were not able to find it (or so they said). She called again the next day to speak to someone else at the Firestone

She called around for estimates, but again, no answer. My cousin couldn't drive the car so had to keep it at the shop, arrange for the money, and two weeks later after all the repairs were complete, she drove it back home. 

Car value $4000 (according to the mechanic)

She ended up paying $9300 after repairs.

1366919681.0,1d3rf9,"Who is James? Help us solve the African mystery of a flash drive, a physicist, and an unusual set of coincidences.",vickio,72,20

I am an American living in Tanzania. On Monday, my friend Michael in Tanzania received a package in the mail from his mother in America. The package had been opened and resealed, which is not uncommon for us because package contents are sometimes checked by the customs office in Tanzania.

Loose, Emily, so he gave the drive to me.

My wife and I watched the videos, neither she nor I recognized the man in the the videos. I gave the drive back to Michael who watched the videos and determined that neither he nor his wife know the man in the videos either. We showed them to others here and no one in our organization recognizes this guy.

At this point

My own investigative work is included below. **Ultimately, and ask him who Emily is. I understand that the posting of personal information on Reddit is forbidden and hope you can help me without violating that rule.

Here is a frame of the video showing James and his surroundings:  
&lt;http://imgur.com/KL8cwbE?&gt;

Here are the actual video files that were found on the flash drive:  
*(REDACTED)*

Here is my case file so far:

### The flash drive ###

*   Lexar JumpDrive TwistTurn USB Flash Drive 16GB
*   Volume name ""LEXAR""
*   Contains three files
    *   ""Video 1.wmv"" (131.8 MB
    *   ""Video 2.wmv"" (172.8 MB
    *   ""Video 3.wmv"" (142 MB
*   A scan of the volume for deleted files reveals nothing

### Notable things that James says ###

*   Video 1
    *   ""Hey Emily""
    *   ""It's James""
    *   ""You've been gone so long""
    *   ""It's Pi day""
    *   ""I hope that you're having a great time in Tanzania""
    *   ""I have included a gift of astronaut ice cream""
    *   ""I hope that it makes [you] less sad to leave Tanzania""
    *   ""I don't know how sensitive they are to alcohol appearing in your classes
    *   ""I don't know if you want to show it to your class or not or if you think I'm just a terrible speaker and you're embarrassed of all your friends""
    *   ""We miss you and I look forward to seeing you in June""
*   Video 2
    *   ""If I were a chemist instead of a physicist""

### Notable items appearing in the videos ###

*   Gray Champion brand t-shirt
    *   ""2007 SEC Champions""
*   Music stand
*   Vacuum cleaner
*   Photo of an unidentified baby
*   Photo of unidentified people sitting at a table
*   Quinta Do Noval Porto Special Reserve bottle
*   3 Calendars
    1.  Featuring an unidentified comic strip
    2.  Featuring an unidentified politician
        *   Turned to July
    3.  Featuring artwork
        *   Turned to January
        *   ""Art is A Hammer""
*   US one dollar bill
    *   Serial number L15396741N

### Things we know about James ###

*   His first name is James
*   He recorded these videos on March 14th
*   He has a friend named Emily who is a teacher in Tanzania
*   He knows someone named Megan who also knows Emily
*   He expects to see Emily in America in June
*   He is
*   He may be associated with Louisiana State University

### Things we know about Emily ###

*   She is a teacher
*   She has been in Tanzania for some time
*   She is leaving Tanzania
*   She will be in America in June

### An unusual set of coincidences ###

*   My wife's name is Emily
*   She is a teacher in Tanzania
*   Michael's wife's name is Megan
*   My wife and I are planning to return to America in May and will be in the states in June

The obvious conclusion is that Michael's wife Megan asked her physicist friend James to record videos of science demos for their mutual friend, James recorded these videos, copied them onto a flash drive, and gave them to Megan's mother-in-law to have shipped to Tanzania. We reject this conclusion on the basis of the following facts:

*   Emily denies knowing James
*   Megan denies knowing James
*   Megan would not have asked a friend to mail a flash drive containing three videos
*   Michael's mother denies having any knowledge of the flash drive in the package she sent or of the videos contained on the drive or of a physicist named James

### A working theory ###

Our current working theory is this:

*   Michael's mother sent him a package with no flash drive in it
*   Someone named James sent a package containing the flash drive to another Emily (not my wife) who is a teacher in Tanzania
*   Both packages were opened by customs in Tanzania and the flash drive was accidentally moved from one package to the other

In support of this theory is the fact that the package Michael received **did not contain the promised astronaut ice cream**.

RBI


**UPDATE (4/26):**  
/u/rr645 found [a blog](http://emilytotanzania.wordpress.com) which is written by someone named Emily with the following similarities to the Emily we are looking for:

*   She is currently teaching chemistry in Tanzania
*   She is returning to the states in June 2013
*   She has a poor internet connection (which explains why James would mail her a flash drive)
*   She specifically mentions missing ice cream

/u/rbidetective noticed that the Emily from that blog studied at the University of Wisconsin. He then found a [list of University of Wisconsin Department of Physics grad students](http://www.physics.wisc.edu/people/gradstudents) and one in particular named James who looks like the man in the videos.

With that info

I will attempt to contact James and Emily on Facebook and will update again if hear anything. Thanks RBI!

**UPDATE 2 (4/26):**  
/u/rr645 has received a response from Emily to a comment he left on her blog. She has confirmed that the James seen in the video screenshot on this post is her friend and that she is the intended recipient of the flash drive!

She never did. It has been about 3 years and there has been no sign of her. No phone calls or emails

From what I've been told, suspected her mother's husband from the beginning and told them as much, and why... They proceeded to ask the husband if he knew anything about her disappearance, which he denied, and they refused to investigate him any further.
 They told her ""We asked him if he knew anything and he said no

The man was remarried within months of her disappearance. 

My friend has sent letters and made phone calls to Jamaican and Canadian authorities and politicians. They have all basically told her that she's shit out of luck

Helpful comments there

I've been receiving anonymous phone calls and text messages from a stalker for over year. She is a woman who had a fling with my ex


My phone carrier has tried to help but the messages don't appear anywhere in call logs. I was under the impression that all calls are logged no matter if they're inbound or outbound.

(Example: make a call at 12:00


The current round of text messages show a series of random numbers as the 'sender' number. Always random

She is likely using her iPhone to make the calls and send the texts. Police have been investigating this for some time. They've questioned the stalker (who denied everything) and believe it is her that is responsible

To be clear


Questions:
NEW: how can there be a call or sms that the phone company has NO record of?

&lt;some backstory&gt; Ive been asking about my dad since I was about 16. For as long as I can remember
I initially asked my mom some family history when my son was born 17 years ago. You know the standard was anyone in the family suffering from this or that. My mom said that no one on her side had any major ailments. So I asked about my dad. She says nope sharply and left it at that. 2 years pass and my wife at the time gets preggo with my daughter. Same medical history questions only to be shot down again. I let it go with the occasional here or there questions. Still cold.
Last year, she could talk to her dad. I ask her to give me that opportunity.
She begins to tell me that I (she) did the best that I could. ""Things could have been different. I had choices. I didn't have to have you"". Of course this enraged me. Did my mom just say to me that she could have aborted me but choose otherwise?! She then goes on to continue to say that I didn't deserve to know who my dad was. Finally I told her then fine. Ill find out on my own. I asked her if my brother and I had the same dad. She at least confessed to that. She said she would take the information to the grave. She doesn't care if she doesn't have a relationship with me or my kids (her grandkids).
Its been about a year since I last spoke to her. She calls me on father's day to wish me a happy father's day. Kinda insult to injury if you ask me. I ask her if she is willing to tell me the information I want to know. Of course she wouldn't.
I sunk to a low and contacted a couple of talk shows in desperation but that has led to nowhere. So now
The guy on my birth certificate may or may not be my actual dad. I know the man and some history but he wont talk to me directly. Ive contacted his sister and his daughter. I know his address but he refuses to talk to me citing that my mother knows the truth and that she should be the one to tell me. Basically it's none of his business. Things began to really unravel when I transfered from private school to public school. I went by my moms last name. The school asked for a birth certificate and low and behold, but if this guy wont talk to me, I doubt hes giving up DNA.

*I'm posting this as a throwaway because whoever is harassing us has already collated enough of our personal information and (should they find this) I'd rather they not be able to dig through my standard Reddit account

Some context: My husband and I are both active making Ron Paul videos on YouTube, a large number of people began making hostile comments and downvoting the video (fair play on YouTube), but then one of them (and I should note that these were mostly brand-new accounts created that day) posted our home address repeatedly in several comments and kept threatening to ""come over.""

Of course, when another brand-new account posts several comments dropping not just our home address, but my husband's work phone, our personal emails, my cell phone, etc. etc... and threatens to come over again. We file another privacy complaint about *that* new sock puppet account with YouTube and update the police, who can't do anything because they claim that individually, and there isn't really such a crime as ""threatening to trespass.""

So all we're left able to do is ignore the douchebags as much as we can

But since a lot of the comments are Jere Brower-ish in style and were initially posted on the Brower-tagged video, and if so, is any of it publicly accessible? If our dox are being dropped there or we're being targeted by name, it'd really help our harassment case. Also, they're dicks.

So I found the group on Facebook. Here are the relevant threads -- we just received the posted images via a fake email from John Vigil.

Be sure to read all the comments if you really want to rage. At this point I'm pretty convinced they're just trolls and not as worried about my person safety

**Update 12:59PM Pacific**

Well, but ""vesty"" appears to be their nickname for my husband. They've insinuated that he's gay more times than I can count now. :P

Since we know who they are now and I'm keeping records of all of this -- anybody think that there's any grounds for legal action against these people? Or should we just shut our traps and let it pass?

1348780618.0,10l0z9,"House was burgled, have some information, what should I do?",ramstoria,41,11, a couple other random things. But my wife's jewelry was taken that was inherited and is irreplaceable. It makes me sick someone would do this.   

Fast forward to a week later. My neighbor told me one of the suspects was arrested (tl;dr arrested for something else, that the neighbor the day after the break in was walking her dog with her toddler and saw the kids again, she snapped a picture of them because it looked like they we're scoping out houses. Cops came, but they were already gone by then. They live in the same complex of condos.

So I go to Google and I find the arrest log

I talked with the Sheriff, but didn't find anything (no idea how thoroughly they searched or if they even knew what to look for, especially with the jewelry). They say hopefully a print hits since he's in the system now. But it doesn't sound too promising. I can only confirm that one of the kids was arrested, but we are 100% there was two involved and the neighbor that called 911 is pretty damn sure there was a third.     

So I have the arrest report, I searched Facebook. Bingo. Found the kid's profile that was arrested, and pretty sure I found the second kid (based on his Facebook picture and the picture my neighbor took) and it's the kid's cousin. The profiles are either private, semi-private, or they just don't post on Facebook ever.    

So where do I go from here? I don't get a shit about the video games and computer that was taken. I have data backed up and we have insurance to replace those items. I care about getting the jewelry back. At this point, but not sure if that's the way to go or what.    

Should I just drop it? Anything more I can do? Any ideas?   

The arrest record and court records are public information

Thanks gang.  

PS. I say kid throughout this

PPS. Yes, each one said they would not buy it because it's not real gold (which we knew).

Please contact me and/or the police if you have any information. Thank you. We need to stop it before it ends up in a chop shop.


My suspicion is if this was someone that stole my sister's keys a month ago than they have already got a buyer and the car is probably gone. But I am hopeful. I don't know if they would go and try and sell it on Craig's List. But I figured that would be a good place to sell off parts if they don't have a chop shop

I was wondering if it is at all possible for me to get my money back from a supposed well known scam. I live in a college student only apartment complex
His information was inconsistent (I should have known..)
I continued to badger him with questions but he eventually sold me
He told me that I can get an immediate refund and that he still gets to win points to a trip to Italy (this is why he's selling) if I get the refund.. But I'm afraid that I will overdraw my bank account with the check that is supposed to be held for 21 days and I am supposed to get a call for an authorization.. 

The affiliated company is MTS Circulation LLC and I looked them up. According to the Better Business Bureau
I'm so nervous now. I really don't have a lot of money

If you guys think there is anything that can be done to find some background info before I approach real LEO's (and which ones should I contact)

**Background**

I purchased a magazine and noticed an add for a symposium (that related to my field of study) that would take place in a month close to my home town.  I signed up early and payed the $169 registration fee.  A few weeks later I received a polite email stating the symposium would be postponed until next year and that I had the option of receiving a refund or purchasing 3 years subscription to the magazine.  Naturally I chose a refund as the subscription rates were a ripoff.  A month later, even though gmail confirmed that they were received.  Naturally, I started to do some digging and found some interesting info.

**Current situation**

The president/owner of the company also owns at least 3 other similar companies.  One or two of them are non-profits, though some digging shows the names of some donors.  Since the early 90s, the companies have received over $15 million worth of grant revenue.  The problem, however, is that these funds are then transferred to the for-profit and they are not used for any sort of research.  The company then uses their money to lobby hate-speech.  Further research indicates that the companies have no physical address, just a PO box.  Some of the people involved are former gov't employees.  I apologize if Im rambling or if this post lacks proper flow.

**TL;DR** Company A is essentially a tax avoidance entity set up to collect funds from donors and commission research to company B.  Company B then uses that money to promote hate-speech and supports radical political movements.   Both companies are owned by the same person.  A lot of people involved are former gov't,,False,,t5_2tayf,1349829477.0,,True

2. Window to basement left open

Marley Lion, and around 4:05 a.m., police found him lying on the ground beside the vehicle. Lion was still alive at the time, and he told an officer he had been sleeping in the car because he was too intoxicated to drive home. He said **two black males walked up to the vehicle and one of them shot him five times** before they left the parking lot on a gravel path toward Yew Street.

It was 2006, from there the FBI agent proceeds to question me in my dorm hallway with me in my boxers and kids from my hall walking by.

After a few minutes the agents start asking questions that indicate to me why I'm being investigated.  I ask the agent point blank what I'm being investigated for and am told until I'm indicted they don't have to reveal why they are investigating me or what for.  But they're questions hint at child pornography.  I was shown a picture of some girl and asked if I had ever seen her before, asks what it is to which I respond that it's a humidifier and change to subject asking if he needs my external back up too.

The FBI ended up taking my laptop and my external hard drive which interestingly and humorously enough was indeed filled with porn but all adult MILF porn like MyFriendsHotWife, MILFHunter, etc.

After taking my laptop the FBI then went door to door to all the other rooms on my hall asking them if they had ever seen or heard me watching child porn.  Needless to say I became rather infamous on my floor after being in school for only a month.

The FBI ended up subpoenaing my roommate infront of a federal grand jury where they asked him questions like if he had ever seen me with child porn

My parents of course were freaked out and hired a federal attorney costing $10

Eventually almost 9 or 10 months after everything began I got a call from my attorney notifying me the FBI was closing my case and I of course was not being charged.

It was a nerve-racking experience especially since I legitimately didn't have any idea what I could be investigated for or why I was in their target.  My only suspicion as to why they were investigating me was because four months before this happened I had been given an MIC at a party over Spring Break, a horrible person, and had inappropriate pictures of their daughter on my MySpace. That was the final straw, I called his lieutenant to report the detective.  His lieutenant was not terribly helpful but after that call the detective stopped calling me, then a month or so later the FBI is on my front door.

The only other thing I had ever done in my life which could semi-warrant an investigation were two fraudulent donation sites I made,False,,t5_2tayf,1367425476.0,,,t3_1dhi56

Of course, they're pretty good about this, but the weird/scary thing is that suppose they forget for one night, it'll happen. Like clockwork. This leads me to believe whoever is doing this slinking around frequently, if not every night. And that pisses me off.

A year goes by and he says he is going off to school

So Fred arrives in NYC and calls up Pablo expecting to go meet up, while visiting his father in the hospital Pablo was knocked over and suffered a concussion, so he was restricted from flying.  No worries, he was taking a train and would be in NYC the next day.  Fred finds another place to crash and then calls Pablo the next day, and Pablo has more bad news - his train is delayed due to inclement weather, but he should be in the next day.  So the next day Fred goes to meet Pablo at the train station, but Pablo calls with yet more bad news - he was robbed on the train and had to meet with the police.  He told Fred to just go about his business

That was the last phone call anyone ever received from Pablo.  Fred texted Pablo after not hearing from him a day or two later and Pablo replied ""You're a good friend

His facebook is still active, and she said he was at the gym but would call back; nobody has answered the home phone # since.  I know his full name, birth date, parents names, and the name of the company where his mother works (though the company posts little to no contact info besides a generic help email).

Some other possibly relevant details:  I found an old article from a year or two after Pablo was born where a person with his father's exact name was convicted of kidnapping.   Pablo and his family spent approximately 6 years traveling the Caribbean on a boat right before we met.

It was at this point that I yelled at my fiance that he needed to get this guy's license plate but when he stepped out of the car and began dialing the police the man reversed at about 50mph into the gas station(Chevron) next to us rather recklessly and then skidded out in an attempt to avoid us catching his plate.. Police were phoned and arrived but unfortunately could not find a plate that matched the vehicle..

I have a partial plate but would this information hurt my case if we were to share it

This unfortunately has left my fiance with a gash that may need stitches in his left cheek.. Otherwise I would have just let it go. I wish I could have done more to help the situation but being 24 weeks pregnant I couldn't really run after the car to confirm the plate.. :/

Update: Wanted to thank gabbythefck for helping me out. It seems that the plate we had taken down is a fake and this guy will likely get off free unless someone happens to see him. I am just really glad someone was there to further help us out. If you happen to see or have info on a beige Nissan Pathfinder with the plate 089YZQ we'd appreciate it.

1358407900.0,16qpcm,Safe With $40K And A Ring Stolen (Reward Offered),ViktorStrangle,34,7,17,"My friend had his safe stolen in Anaheim

##Background Info

""I run a cash business where we collect cash payments for the sale of Disneyland tickets. On 10/09/12. Me and my business partner went on vacation returning 10/24/12. We left the company to our employees while we were gone. 

On 10/22/12 at approximately 8:00 a.m, he found that everything was untouched in the office except than the safe was gone. The safe contained approximately $40,000 cash, and one diamond ring valued at around $600 (details below see: **diamond ring**). 


I know
There are two doors that enter the building (both require a key to enter). The one door is in the back, entered in the back door, as we saw no-one enter in through the main door. 


There is no suspicious persons or anything useful in this one camera, leaving at 1:00 pm on 10/21/2012 empty handed. There are also no cameras with other coverage around the premises. There are cars shown on this camera entering and leaving the parking lot, but unfortunately none are too easily seen, and many cars drive into the parking lot over night, as with our business, you must drop tickets off after you are done using them in our 24 hour drop box. 

There is an alarm system in the building, etc. 

All doors were said to be locked before leaving the premises at 1:00 pm by employee **R** who worked on 10/21/2012. 



---

##Suspects

Here is a list of employees/ partners of the business with a brief description. Everyone listed below has access to both a key to get into the main building, but not our office. If anyone need any extra information, please let me know.

* **R**- Female in her 30s. Used to be in the military. Slow girl, but then took off all of December due to a vacation she was going to take to Chicago. I spoke with her recently and she said she has post traumatic stress syndrome and has been sent to San Francisco to get rehab, and she didn't make it to Chicago, but can't come back to work. I sent her an e-mail, and upon reply will be able to see if IP address matches for San Francisco. Her story stayed the same that she didn't have money, and she never seemed to get her car fixed from when she would come to work.

* **M**- Male  in his 20s. He is a senior in college, and his last day was 10/24 when we got back to the trip.

* **B** and  **V**- Males in their 30s. We found **V** to help out with our projects through Craigslist, due to a slow down at the office (no hard feelings were seemed to be felt). The two came in on the Friday before the robbery (10/19)  to pick up their last paycheck. and were seen walking around the office in areas they did not need to go. We share office space with a med center and one of there employees noticed them in the front while my business is only in the back area.  Both are ex-military members. **V** has a family and wife, and has always been respectful. **B** had tendencies to not show up to work on certain days, and his brother would always apologize. **B** and **V** would sometimes ""forget"" to give back certain change amounting to no more than $10 when going out for errands, etc. **B** always had excuses when he didn't come in to work. **B** has told me that he doesn’t have a job and sells weed as his main income and that his friend grows it outdoors. 

---

##Aftermath

Based on the above info, and saw him and his brother driving around in seemingly new vehicles. Our PI confronted **V** at his house, and the detective was told the cars were used to help them move packages from their old apartment to a new one. The one was a friends and the other was **V**'s wife new car. When **V** was asked by the PI if he though **B** did it, he said he wasn't sure. The wife seemed upset at this time, saying **B** has gotten them into trouble before. I had the private investigator look into **B**s bank accounts, and he found $300 in one account, and a negative balance in the other. It seems **B** is still living with **V** and **V**’s wife at the new apartment they moved in to

When **B** was asked by the police detective to come in for questioning


At this point, and the detective has already told **V** there was a private eye following **B**, so following will probably lead to little if anything. 

Other than suing the landlord for negligence in not paying the alarm company, and now I am in debt.

Help us find Emilee Irsik! On October 19, TX and then to London Heathrow Airport. She then flew on British Airways to Hamburg, Germany arriving on October 20. She was to return to Wichita on October 26. Unfortunately, Emilee did not board her scheduled return flight and she has not rebooked on a later flight. Her cell phone has been off since she departed Dallas, TX on the 19th, and all attempts to contact her via email, Facebook, University of Hanover
with the NCIC registry. The American Citizen’s Service Unit of the US Embassy in Berlin has notified the police in Hamburg that she is missing and her family is concerned about her welfare. The police in Hamburg have in-turn notified other police departments across Germany. There is also information regarding Emilee on German radio. If Emilee spoke to you regarding this trip, please contact local law enforcement or the US Department of State at (202) 647-4000 and ask to be transferred to the Duty Officer in Berlin. If you are overseas, please contact the German police or contact the local US Embassy. Please “share” this group with your friends, and anyone you know in Germany or may have contacts in Germany. As her family, we are extremely concerned about her welfare and just want to bring her home. Please join us in praying for her safe return. Please send all media requests to this page and you will be contacted by Emiliee's family as soon as possible.

In pursuit of a better job, a place that was in fact nicer than my old place, but the area around us was fairly shady.

We live pretty much across the street from a corner store and it's no chore to walk there and back. Yesterday

* Droid (Plan B didn't work worth shit and Verizon is basically laughing at me because I installed CM7.)
* Guitar in hard
* Desktop computer (With all of the music I've written over the last 10 or so years).
* Laptop (Gaming-grade laptop with all of my accounts set to log in automatically) Side note: I have a BIOS password on it and Prey installed
* Nikon D700 + about $3000 of lenses + a couple years worth of photos.
* External hard drive

I'm lucky enough that they didn't try to take my 42"" monitor

It wasn't a smash-and-grab job

What hurts pretty badly is that my Facebook, Steam, Gmail and original Reddit account have since been hijacked. Google is being really, REALLY slow to help me. Like... One canned response. They're probably not going to be able to in at least a couple days because of my phone situation. Valve can't help because my Gmail is unrecoverable. Same with deviantArt and same with Facebook.

My girlfriend called my room mate wondering what the deal is with my Facebook which has been horrifically defaced. Friends messaged

**Why does my son have an iPhone?** My son's father is a verbally abusive tool. When my son turned 5 I got a Firefly (kid's phone) to maintain direct contact while he was with his Dad. Fast forward a few years and I dropped my iPhone 4 in the toilet the night before the 4S release. Bought the 4S the next day. The phone randomly came back to life a week later and passed it along to my son considering the fact he had gone years without breaking or losing his cheap kiddie phone.  His understanding has always been that he's ""borrowing"" it and it will be repossessed without notice if me or my husband need it.

**Retrieval:**  The phone lost signal right as my husband was arriving.  When he got there, what if they kill me""?  The police arrived, my husband had to provide various methods of proof to get the phone back.  The police officer called the woman and she swears she just found it and didn't know (which is bullshit, I sent messages to the phone via Find My iPhone).  Oh well, she paid $110 already and we have the phone back.  Plus I called her from an offsite, private, blocked number and explained to her what a cunt (a word I have only used twice in my life) she is and society would appreciate her finding a job to pay her bills as opposed to stealing from a child.

Original post .....

&gt; So the story came up once again of how supposedly you swallow 8 spiders in your sleep over the span of a year. [Snopes has debunked this](http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/spiders.asp). Lisa Holst of ""PC Professional"" wrote an article making outrageous claims in order to prove that people on the internet believe anything.

&gt; Problem is, ""PC Professional"", and the people-are-so-gullible article all apparently do not exist.

&gt; [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVmnLaTXylc) gives a good summary of the situation. The three pages mentioned in the dideo are [this](http://www.eightspiders.com/2008/08/why-eight-spiders.html) [this](http://ask.metafilter.com/146671/Paging-Lisa-Birgit-Holst) and [this](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2094/is-a-writer-named-lisa-holst-responsible-for-the-belief-that-everyone-eats-eight).

&gt; Now it could well be that the story of ""it was a story made up by Lisa Holst"" could very well itself be made up. (Yo dog!) I know it is hard to prove a negative

&gt; I have seen the hive mind pull off some crazy detective work before. Figuring out a license plate just from the indentation it made in a car crash.

More sleuthing led me to find that this guy has been at this for a while.  Running his phone number on Craigslist showed me multiple listings of phones that he was selling.  I've texted him from a different number offering to buy one of these phones as a sort of trap to find out where he lives
What I know for sure:


- The Man's appearance.


- I have the serial number and IMEI of my Nexus 4.  It has no personal information or pictures on it and I did a factory reset


- The car he drives.  It was a bumble bee yellow Pontiac Sunfire.  I have his license plate number.  If anyone has some kind of way to associate an address with it

- As I mentioned in the last bullet

- I have his cell phone number.  He's been using this number since at least October.  He is on T-Mobile and using an unlocked iPhone 3G or 3GS (at least

- His Significant Other's phone number.  It was a second number listed on one of his ads.  

- His S/O's name.  She had a voicemail

- This is *not* his first time doing this.  He has multiple phone listings on craigslist

That's essentially all I know about the guy.  Ideas I've had include setting up a few fake phone ads and seeing if he bites on any of them, and T-Mobile is sending me a new one, but I'd like to stop this guy and get my phone back.

A friend just clued me in to reddit after NO help from the state department and police department. My brother Steve served in the US military as an Army Ranger and returned as a private contractor this year, his laptop was missing from his room. All his private info was on there-- scanned copies of birth certificate, SSN card, credit card info, access to FB, gmail, linkedin

No one will do anything to help him. Although this private company is under the state department, he could possibly figure out who it was. Somehow he's been able to track down his facebook IP addresses, and there were three he doesn't recognize, from Texas. He hasn't been in Texas lately, that's for sure. He has the IP addresses and the time accessed.  He's been texting all this info to me from his phone and asked me to call a PI to see if anyone can help. He called police departments in Texas and they said they can't do anything either. I called a PI today, and they told me they need a subpoena to get any information. If he could just find out the name of the person who did this, he would be able to track that person down from the small pool of people who work at this base and hopefully find out what was done with his computer. Like I said

Hope someone out there can help me.... I'm not the most computer savvy so please keep that in mind with the computer lingo you send my way. I will absolutely send you the IP addresses and info he gave me

Hi all. I know my chances are slim, and I want to reunite them so badly. I'll start at the VERY beginning... 

K was very sick in high school. Her mother got her a little kitten whose health was also very poor as a way of making her feel more ""in control."" K had to take care of this kitty

Well, K was out of the country. Anyway, they ate dinner outdoors every single night so they could let Sassy, an indoor cat, play outside supervised for a short time. Sassy didn't always go outside, though; they just liked making it an option for her for an hour or two every night. 

One night, etc. But there are about 200 condos in this complex and they had no idea where to look. Cats are easy to conceal. 

So it seemed like all hope was lost, Sassy has a VERY distinct appearance. In addition, they recognized the tiling and the bar stool as the ones in every single condo in the complex in which Sassy was stolen. 

However, please, please say who stole the cat. K's mother even offered her $3000, as the cat was worth $2000 and the extra $1000 would just be a bonus. In response, the girl who posted the picture said ""I'm sorry, I really am, but I can't tell you

Anyway, but every time K drives home, she stops by the condos and walks around, looking for Sassy and asking people if they've seen Sassy. 

We don't know much about the family that stole Sassy

•African-American.
•Somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga
•The ""best friend"" mentioned before goes to Etiwanda High School.
•Condos where Sassy was stolen are near Victoria Gardens.

  * Any personal anecdotes must be highly relevant and only used to give context to information or suggestions that you share. Only report the essential facts and do not use this subreddit to practice your literary skills.

* I reported it as lost through my Canadian carrier (Fido)

If the thief wipes it


If I lock it via Find my Phone App

2. I am now playing the waiting game hoping the thief will turn the iPhone back on. If he does


3. Report to police??

It happened a little after 1am on October 13th.

Stupid I know, they say they didn't see my phone (I should've frisk them down...).

Shortly after I knew it was taken, it went straight to voicemail (I know that I had signal inside of the place and it was at ~30% battery at the time so they probably turned it off).

Asked lost and found

I filed a police report the next day and occasionally check iCloud and Cylay (phone's unlocked/jailbroken T-Mobile) but because I turned off wifi/data cellular before I got into the club

I check craigslist to see if anything comes up in the Los Angeles area

I'm desperate to find my phone again so monetary reward for anyone that can help, I'd just like it back :(

In short

He came here on a green card or work visa. It expired and he had to go back home. But during his 1-2ish year stay in the US

All I know is that my biological father was in the USA when my mom got pregnant. I know his first and last name. And I have a book and an old letter written in Serbian or whatever he speaks. Someone kind of translated it but the letter wasnt written to me. It was written to someone else and he mentions knowledge of me. And he mentioned some other kids of his (I found out about this letter when I was like ... 14

My mom is getting older and cant really fill in too much for me. I have a book about a city called Ljubjiana (this is from memory ... I just moved so I dont know where the book actually is right now). And it had an address taped inside but I couldn't find the address on google maps or anything. But found something that sounded almost like it in Slovenia. But mom has always told me they lived in Serbia. 

Mom and I have always been a little too worried about my stepdad's feelings to really pursue getting in contact with my biological father (my stepdad raised me since I was 4). But now I'm 30 years old .... I mean

So if  you guys could give me some starting points. Can I talk to some embassy and explain and see if they could pull some immigration records? Or what? I have no clue where to really start. I tried to google his name but his last name is fairly common and I doubt a 50

Sidenote: My biological dad's roommate used to live in the US and probably still does. My mom was good friends with his American wife. But they've been divorced for a long time and my mom hasnt talked to them in over 20 years.

Google voice's transcribing has been a huge help, especially for an occasional laugh, but this is either too brief or too inaudible to transcribe.

1357922450.0,16dwh1,I Need Your Help Identifying This Guy (Catfish?),paynoattentionokay,7,0,23,"**Hi RBI. I made this throwaway last month

**The quoted text is basically my original post with some updated detail changes.  The crazy latest update from this morning is under it.  I apologize for the length




&gt; In the spring I was contacted by a man from  a dating site.  When he contacted me
He is originally from my area, even though neither of us were looking for anything more than friendship and conversation, it blossomed very quickly to much more.

&gt; His personal story was quite fantastical. Almost unbelievable. From an awful family and love life, for months. Although, it was a lot to take in, I never could pinpoint a reason to doubt him.

&gt; Two months into our exchange, he said his life was going to be changing too much (because of the monkey wrench), and we should cut things off and ot would be easier for him to have us never speak again. He pretty much cried during the conversation.  It didn't make any sense and my attempts to reach him since have been futile.

&gt; I'm sure most of you are thinking, but it is-- please trust me. Also, if certain things he told me are truthful, they are possibly dangerous.

&gt; What is weirdest of all is that I have enough information to where you would think I could easily locate him and verify his information. But the more research I do




&gt; **Information I have**


&gt;  * **Name:** I have his first and last name (he said he wasn't given a middle name). His name is extremely common

&gt;  * **Birthday:** I believe I know his city of birth as well.

&gt;  * **E-mail Address**

&gt;  * **Phone Number:** He has a work assigned cell and personal cell. I have the personal number. Some voicemails to me are saved.

&gt;  * **Screenname:** The one he used on the forum.

&gt;  * **Location:** Current city and area of the city. I know of previous places he has lived. He also has claimed to currently own some properties.

&gt;  * **School/Work:** I know what colleges he attended and major.   He said he had a PhD.  The schools are in Maryland and California.  One is an Ivy.  I know what type of job he works but not clear on details.

&gt;  * **Family/Friends:** I know the name of one family member and one friend. I know how many siblings and nieces/nephews he has.

&gt;  * **Pictures:** I have three photos of him. Yes




&gt; **Research**





&gt;  * **Pictures:** The images he sent me of himself were through the site we met on. Reverse Google image search comes up empty.

&gt;  * **E-mail Address:** Googled, but then I realized our e-mails were just from me. He would never respond back through e-mail.

&gt;  * **Phone Number:** He mentioned phone was no contract. Found out it was a MetroPCS phone (probably a burner). The name registered to the phone has the same first name, and has produced nothing in searching.  **--UPDATE: This number is now registered to a different name altogether.  My best guess  is he switched his number and a new person now owns this particular number.**

&gt; However

&gt;  * **School/Work:** Not much here. Only guy with exact school and degree match I could find

&gt;  * **Screenname:** Results are from the site we met on.

&gt;  * **Social Networking:** He said he didn't do Facebook or anything. Looked into all of them

&gt;  * **Other info:** He claims to have patents

&gt; Just to be clear, he never claimed to be in another country at any point or was educated anywhere else. He never asked me for money, favors, or for confidential details. In fact, when I passingly told him money was a bit tight, he offered to send me a large sum of cash or a check-- several times. Which I found to be out of bounds, and another reason of many in wanting to confirm this guy.




-----------------**UPDATE**---------------------------------

I had rejoined the same dating site a couple of months ago, his picture was the first one to show up.

I was completely shocked.  His location was set to NYC, so WTF?

I kept reading, pet, and two of his photos (one he had on his original profile, and one he had sent me through the site privately) were the same.

The other two photos that were posted, and three years younger.  In this ""about me"" he gave a different first name (which was also in ID name).  He stated he was ""new"" to NY.  That he was raised in AZ, went to school in Massachusetts, and landed his ""dream job"" in Los Angeles, where he has been living ever since.

I saved the photos and took screenshots of the profile.  I wrote to him with just “?” (I didn’t know what to say, even the style of writing seemed off.   I wrote “****, I’m confused, and this isn’t making sense so what is going on”.  I was immediately blocked.

I was thinking maybe by chance this was someone else, and wrote briefly explaining what the situation was and what I was trying to figure out.  Again, I was blocked.  Shortly after, the profile information and pictures were removed.  A few minutes later, everything was deleted and the account was closed.

I can only come up with three scenarios for this: A) This is the same guy I was talking to, and went back into hiding.  B) Someone else has his photos, made a profile (maybe somehow knows him since some of the details were the same), embarrassed he got caught and deleted everything. C)These photos belong to someone else all together, and it's an operation done by two or more people.

**Now I need suggestions on where do I go from here.  What other avenues can I look into?  How can I proceed in finding out the truth?**
**Again, and would be so thankful. I would be happy to give any personal information that might help...privately... since it’s not allowed on here.  Thank you!**

Hello everyone, Alan. My family is from Moore, Oklahoma and as you know, we've been through some shit the last few weeks. thankfully none of my family was hurt, and we had very little property damage, but in the aftermath of the storms, we weren't so lucky. see theres a reall shitty subset of people in the world

He plays in a band called ""Brown Note"", for a friday show, my uncle returned to his house to find it gone. all of it. 70k worth of speakers, boards, guitars, and all sorts of home made shit he'd made over the years. Luckily it was insured, but insurance can only do so much.

The biggest casualty was my uncle's favorite guitar. His Charvel. here's a pic of [""The Goat""](http://i.imgur.com/wfYUpha.jpg) .

Its a Charvel San Dimas Style 2. and is out of production. My late Grandpa helped him pick it out

So my request is this, but that guitar was an extension of him. It would mean the world to my family to have it back. Thanks for your time everyone.

Saturday May 25th 11:30PM, and after the following incident.](http://imgur.com/a/UQPKX) 

Sunday May 26th at 1:30PM, so I file a report in the evening for suspected hit and run. 

Monday morning my bike is missing. File stolen vehicle report, then 2 men used a trolly to hold my locked front wheel while they rolled it on to the truck bed. Like the picture,  the truck has windows for the back seat that are separated from the passenger window by some of the frame. Video quality is too grainy to make out much else.

Monday being a holiday, and security company handling building cameras have the day off. Smart, as Tuesday I'm told by numerous places that their cams only save 24 hours of footage (probably a lie from low level employees who don't know/care). Canvas the neighborhood and see that KarTek across the street has high res video showing the traffic, report it to the detective, and he claims it's too far away to really matter. What no one seems to understand or care about is it I find any images of the truck passing, I can more easily get a make/model, put together a route of where they were heading, which I'm happy to do

VIN is 4MZAX57J533420153 and license is 16S7035. What appears to be the gas tank is actually a plastic cover which can be removed and will likely be sold, I can't prove it's mine so they won't investigate. I'll be keeping an eye out for other posts that include this guy's number. My levers also fit Yamaha R1 and R6 models, and in the words of the officer, ""Weird yours got stolen, usually only R6's get nicked out here.""

***And now on to the original post:

From the code on this link:

http://www.zodiackillerciphers.com/?p=179

Here is what I figured out.
I added the lines

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahadabra

Here is how I got **418**. Using the Zodiac Killer's code (see above), the second integer, aka after the [:], is how many times it occurred in a row. The totals of these numbers, with their appropriate positive or negative attributes, gave me a subtotal for each line. These subtotals, also both positive and negative



Line 1:  +22:5, +1:1; +22:10, Line 1= 0

Line 2:  -187:1, +22:5, -419:1, +22:5, Line 2= 0

Line 3: +254:1, +22:3, +1:1, +22:12, Line 3= 232

Line 4: -187:1, +22:6, -419:1; +22:6, Line 4= -209

Line 5:+254:1, +22:2, +1:1, +22:14, Line 5= 232

Line 6: -187:1, +22:7, -419:1, +22:7, Line 6= -209

Line 7:+254:1, +22:1, +1:1, +22:16 Line 7= 232

Line 8:-187:1, +22:8, -419:1, +22:8 Line 8=  -209

Line 9: +254:1, +22:18           Line 9=  232

Line 10: -187:1, -419:1, +22:9,  Line 10=  -209

Line 11: -208:1

Line 12: -208:1, +22:9, +1:1, Line 12=  -230

Line 13: -187:1, -419:1     Line 13=  -209

Line 14: +254:1, +22:8, +1:1, +22:2,  Line 14= 232

Line 15: -187:1, +22:1, -419:1, +22:1, Line 15= 232

Line 16: +254:1, +22:7, +1:1, +22:4,   Line 16= 232

Line 17: -187:1, +22:2, -419:1, +22:2,  Line 17= -209

Line 18: +254:1, +22:6, +1:1, +22:6,  Line 18=  232

Line 19: -187:1, +22:3, -419:1, +22:3,  Line 19= -209

Line 20: +254:1, +22:5, +11:1, +12:1, +22:7,  Line 20= 232

Line 21: -187:1, +22:4, -419:1, +22:4   Line 21= -209


Total is + 418 (From the sum of individual lines' totals.)

Here is some of what the Wiki article says about Abrahadabra and 418:

""ABRAHADABRA has 11 letters
ABRAHADABRA = 1+2+2+1+5+1+4+1+2+2+1 = 22
The five letters in the word are: A, the Cup; H, the Sword; R, the Rosy Cross; and refer further to Amoun the Father, Thoth His messenger, and Isis, Horus, the divine-human triad.
Also 418 = ATh IAV
418= BVLShKIN
418= RA HVVR
418= הרו-רא-הא
418= AIFΑΣΣ
418= The sum of all integers between 13 and 31 inclusive.
Abrahadabra is from Abrasax
418 = 22 x 19 Manifestation""



*Notice the 22x19=Manifestation

Edit: I looked up the 800+ pg. FBI file where this magic square was from. Also in there were a couple of photocopies of detailed pictures of someone practicing Thelema (robed magician sitting in a pentagram

I looked up every older alphabet I could find, it has its own alphabet—and a very ambiguous one at that. Thelema has two alternates for every letter, and uses pictures. Many of the pictures matched up to the Zodiac's.

So in fact

He may not live (He has suffered several strokes and other setbacks while in the ICU) and if he does he will almost certainly have permanent brain damage.

A bit about my cousin: He's a 22 year old guy, never been in a fight in his life, laid back, likes to play videogames, watch ted videos, typical stuff. Blood tests showed that he was not drunk when the assault happened.

The suspects: You can view surveillance camera pictures of the suspects here:

[http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf](http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf)

One is a white male, medium build with a shaved head. He was last seen wearing a Portugal soccer jersey. The other is a woman described as having a dark complexion, 25−30, with long, black, curly hair.

They both appear to be smoking.

We've created a website with more details at at [http://www.justicefordan.ca](http://www.justicefordan.ca)

Earlier in the day there had been a soccer game between Spain and Portugal. The male suspect is wearing a Portugal jersey with what looks like a number 7 on the front which is Renaldo's number.

Please take a look and share these pictures with anyone who you know who might have been in the area. This was a savage and unprovoked attack that's left a good guy fighting for his life.  If you have any suggestions or questions please feel free to ask.  I've cross posted this from /r/toronto

I was in probably 8th grade and got a random instant message on AOL instant messenger from someone I didn't know. They asked if I was ""x"" (I wasn't) so it seemed like an innocent mistake but we got to chatting (it was a girl's screen name so at that age I was excited to talk to almost any girl) at first about innocent stuff but it turned sexual quickly (and if you guys remember A/S/L whoever it was knew very quickly that I was in the 11-13 range)

The person would ask about what sexual experiences I had had and what I was doing and what I liked. I would send pictures (non - sexual) of me in hopes of impressing this ""girl"". The girl would send me pictures of pornography (girls) and we would send dirty IMs back and forth (""she"" would ask me to describe in detail me masturbating etc.) 

She would always say she was going to send me pictures as soon as she was at her dad's house (said her parents were divorced and she lived with her mom) but only sent me one picture (fake off the internet I'm sure) the whole time we talked. We probably talked about a year before either we stopped messaging back and forth. (Can't remember why we stopped)

Looking back, maybe there is a way to uncover their identity or potentially stop a predator.

Sorry for the long back story
AIM Screen name : keilyp   (formatted to look like KellyP)
Said she lived in ""West Virginia"" but who knows.

I went to aol.com and clicked ""forget password""  for that screen name and it said I could send a link to following email address to reset the password (I didn't)

d*****e@msn.com   (The stars are put in by AOL)

Who knows

      My mother had her credit card information stolen a few months ago. As soon as she had noticed odd transactions (about $60 in credit checks and a subscription to lovefilm.com) she had the card canceled and the number switched. Also, medical insurance, and credit repair services. These phone calls seem odd because they have been to her work phone which she has had for only a year. Not her cell phone.

From my understanding

So far the only action taken by my mother has been switching cards. Is there anything else that could possibly be done to help secure her information? Should I file a report to the police? Lastly

I appreciate any responses. Thanks RBI!

1372005424.0,1gwxk4,Help me analyze the clues in adoption agency letter to lead to the birth mother,njnj999,11,7,12,"I've been trying to help my boyfriend locate his birth mother (he was adopted in Florida and the records are sealed). The only thing we have to go on is what they call ""non-identifying information"" as provided by the adoption agency. Non-identifying information is exactly that-- vague references

I listed all the vague facts we received below in hopes someone might  be able to provide me with some good guesses as to what the real info might be. There is a lot of info, I would love to hear them (we've also tried 3 dna services and all the adoption registries and have come up dry).

-My boyfriend's birth mother was born in 1941/1942 in Ontario

(Which town could this be? what are the options for military bases

--Facts about the birth mother: while growing up in Canada

(if I can figure out the town she lived in

-Facts about birth mother's family: her father was from England before moving to Canada and at was at one time a concert pianist. I estimate he was likely born sometime between 1900-1920

(any way to get more info on concert pianists in England/Canada in this timeframe?).

The birth mother's father left the family shortly after her birth and moved to a ""northern central US state"" and operated a wood business. The birth mother's mother worked as a crane operator ""during the war"" (did not specify which war) and later died of uterine cancer. The birth mother had twin brothers who later married and had children in Canada. One of these twin brothers had a child with muscular dystrophy (born 1960 or 1961).

(is it odd that the she worked as a crane operator? Any guesses where this might have been?)

-Facts about birth mother meeting her husband: Sometime in the late 50's to 1960

(any ideas what ""heavy equipment operator"" is code for?)

They married and lived on the Michigan base, born in 1960-61 timeframe. In either 1962 or 1963 they moved to Tyndall AFB in Florida.

In 1964, 5'6, 135 pounds with brown hair dyed black and ""pleasingly striking"" in appearance.  The birth mother belonged to a local Presbyterian Church at or near Tyndall and may have sung in the choir.  

The birth mother's husband (NOT my boyfriend's birth father) was 26 years old in 1964-- he was a serviceman and worked as a ""heavy equipment operator"".  Her husband was sent to Asia in 1963 and returned in January 1964-- when he returned he suffered from infectious hepatitis and was hospitalized at Tyndall for one month to recover.

While the birth mother's husband was on assignment in Asia

When the birth mother's husband returned

* She has attempted to get the police involved. They said something along the lines of needing proof. (I'm a little hazy on this part)

One of my clients came in (she isn't rich or super wealthy or anything) and was visibly upset. She's had a bad week. She had some issues with her car's tires and unfortunately had to take it to firestone to get new ones. 


One of the employees there was checking under the hood ""for good customer service reasons"" and my client explains ""I just had a lot of work done on the car



She tells me that the firestone employee was very very upset



These people had her address and various sensitive details about my client. 


Needless to say her tire had a 5 inch slash in it. She lives in a gated community and the creeps who did it must have waited for someone to let them in.


Its a quieter neighborhood and she could hear the car driving away quickly.



this is a much older lady. Very very sweet and nice. She treats me with respect and kindness and we chat often. I can't imagine her having enemies.


My urge to kill can't be controlled..... I'm fucking mad and want to do something. 



But these people are obviously dangerous and aren't afraid to retaliate.


We don't have total proof. All I have so far is that its obviously a male

So I was called about a month ago by a private investigation company in Los Angeles that had been looking for my mother and Aunt (the two heirs to my maternal grandmother). They said that they were owed substantial funds (the low to mid six figures) from something my grandmother had. (we don't know if they were unknown bonds, etc.) Of course, the company won't tell us what the funds are from until we sign something that says that they will receive 35% of any found funds. Obviously, I'm trying to circumvent using them and finding the funds ourselves.

I've gone on all the ""Unclaimed Funds"" sites to no avail. I've checked with a couple of life insurance companies

My thought process (and this is where I need your help) is:
The PI company is doing the opposite of what we're doing. He must have a list of names of people owed money and his job is to find their heirs.

So does he have some software? Where would he find such a list?

She lives about 2 hours away from me but we've both honestly been busy her being in high school and me with just life honestly and I haven't had the time to visit plus her parents have to give it the OK.

She's sent me a ton of pictures

I found another account on the same site with a different last name (one of her parents). This is where stuff gets really fishy. She always will call me with her friends and list off their names or say who she's with

So I bring this up to her we argue about trust and the next day 50+ posts on this site are deleted most are ones we talked about but some aren't. This is too obvious so I'm not sure what's up there.

After prison Novak meets this really wealthy guy


In my opinion, that if Dolezsar is bumped off all fingers will point to him because of the financial incentive. Some of Novak's friends quote him as saying during an unguarded moment that the perfect way to commit a crime is to pin it on someone else (so the police stop looking).


Novak finds a nice real estate developer living in a neighboring condo who looks kind of like a stereotypical hitman (Eugene Christopher Wright) and introduces him to Dolezsar. Dolezsar is supposed to give a couple million to Wright for a real estate deal. Then Novak (who has the key to Wright's condo[1]) possibly plants a shell casing in Wright's apartment and possibly obtains some DNA to plant in Dolezsar's car. Novak gets Wright to buy an untraceable cellphone to talk to Dolezsar, 2007.


When the police come by asking questions, the DNA, and a weak eyewitness. While police are investigating, Novak, who is friends with Wright, spends time with Wright's wife and asks her a lot of questions about the investigation. After Wright is arrested, Novak suddenly leaves town.


During the 11 hour deliberations


It really bugs me that it's likely that a sociopath criminal framed an innocent man here


You can watch the crime special for the story: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINb2kAeeV0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINb2kAeeV0). If someone could get Wright's wife to do an AMA that would be awesome.
