My step-daughter graduated last December from University. I paid for her to go to college

From time to time her deadbeat father would pop into her life and she would fawn all over him. Although he has not contributed a cent to her education or paid any child support

The wedding venue holds 250 people max. I gave them a list of 20 people that I wanted invited, I saw one of my friends on this list at the golf course and asked if he was coming. He told me that he wasn't invited. He told me that he got an announcement, but not an invitation. He had it in his back seat (along with probably six months of mail) and showed it to me. Sure enough, it was just an announcement, and my name was nowhere on it. It had her dad's name and her mom's name and not mine. 

This led to a pretty big fight with my GF, I might be able to get a couple people in."" But that is an ultimate slap in the face in my opinion. So, I was boiling on Saturday.

Yesterday

I don't think I have ever felt so angry and so disrespected. I was shaking. I took a few seconds to gather my composure

""I'd like to make a toast."" The sound of spoons against glasses ring in my years. ""It has been my great pleasure to be a part of this family for the past ten years."" Awe, commanding great respect and sought out for help in times of need, it seems instead that I hold the position of an ATM, good for a stream of money, but not much else. As I have been replaced as host, both on the invitations and in the ceremony, I am resigning my financial duties as host to my successor

Is this selfish? I'm supposed to shell out 40 - 50 grand for a wedding that I can't invite anyone to? That I am not a part of? I'm so done with this crap. I'm done with my step-daughter, but the other vendors have been great about refunding. 

TLDR: You want your ""REAL DAD"" to be on the invitation, your ""REAL DAD"" can pay for everything too.

EDIT: The immediate aftermath was tantrum and people sitting there mumbling while not actually saying anything to me, not once. Today's aftermath is kind of depressing for me. GF brought me Bride's wedding planner to show me how much work I was ruining. I thumbed through it, found a page in the music section for Father / Daughter dances. All of the songs were catered to Real Dad's taste. So I thought they were just being disrespectful, but now I'm feeling like they never really gave a crap at all, especially since the menu included two ingredients I'm allergic to, that actually made me laugh. Either way, I'm glad to be done, I never promised to pay for the wedding. I offered them the use of my home when they were sure it was going to be small, let it be the bride's family then

EDIT: June 9th 1:15 am. Girlfriend and Bride are now moved out. They are moving in with the groom. It was very hard not to be petty with some of the ""belongings"" they took with them, I will let you know, but I can't guarantee that I will put in the effort to find out. From what I've heard they are trying to ""scale things back"" and get his parents to help out. GF burned bridges when I found out she tried to write herself a check on our joint account the day after the unpleasantness. By then I had already moved money, so I guess I'm a bigger ass than her, but I could feel it coming. That's all. Thanks.",,False,t5_2ranw,True
1362455907.0,19opc3,This is 20 years too late. ,time_to_confess,3825,931,401,"Hello everyone. This is a rather tragic story. It will not be suitable for light hearts. It's my deepest

20 years ago, Mathieu, was 14 months old. And his older brother Sam, 2 years of age. Mathieu was the happiest of children. He would smile at you even if he didn't know who you were. He was the sweetest, happiest little boy to ever cross into my life. Both of my sons were all I needed and wanted. My wife and I were 18 when she got pregnant. She was so happy, that I couldn't even grimace. I swore my self to her and married her when she was 6 months pregnant with my Sam. She was so beautiful then. Her smile could make a well kept man go mental. She was an extraordinary specimen. 

                         The Incident. 

 It was a freezing winter's morning. 19°F.  The roads were slick; the people's coats were packed on like the snow blankets covering the ground. I had work at 9 am that morning. I awoke to Mathieu; crying. It was 8:43. I had to be at work in 17 minutes. My boss had a no tolerance policy and would dock your pay for too many tardinesses. I knew I couldn't be late. 

 I got my son and myself ready and was out of the door by 8:51. I was rushing my son and I to my mother's house, time was going extremely slow. I felt as if I was the Grim Reaper, watching this ordeal from an orb of some sort. And *I* chose my fate. I came back to reality to see me nearing the truck. I maneuvered my truck to hit my side of the his. Hoping to save me from my son's injury. It was no use. I survived, woke up in a hospital some time later with a broken  femur and head trauma. My son's neck was broken from the impact. He died instantly. 

I remember telling the nurse ""I want to see my son. I need to know he's okay."" She looked away, my whole life changed. My wife blamed me and left without a trace. The next time I saw her, was 16 years later. She was sitting in a casket. She died from a fall while mountain climbing. The last time I saw her alive. She was crying and yelling at me, she wanted me to take my son's place. And frankly, I did too. I still do. 

Since then, it was from an office guillotine.) Many run ins with the law, and overall, a broken, beaten, shrivelled up heart. A heart that is set in stone. And unmendable heart. 

He would've been 21. I could've taken him and my eldest son out for a beer, and you have to deal with them, or die. It's one feeling knowing that someone died because if you, it's a whole other, morbid feeling to know that it your own son. And that of a toddler. 

Though I shed many tears as I wrote this, I will remain. Thank you all for reading.

This year has been absolutely miserable.  After living with my girlfriends parents for years to get on our feet we did it at the beginning of this year.  

I was promised a promotion at work which would bring in MUCH more money and we could live comfortably, and our bills fell behind and I fell into a deep depression.  

I have been paying rent, and my kids are asking me why we don't have a Christmas tree? How am I supposed to tell them that we can't afford one?

I have sold all of my stuff worth of any value to be able to pay some bills and I have nothing left.  My power is due to be cut off on December 10 because of a $400.00 past due balance

I just got off the phone with my landlord asking in a not so happy tone when the rest of Decembers rent would be paid.  I feel like a complete and utter failure.  It pains me to my core

Or what I will say on Monday when we have no power or water.  I am working two minimum wage jobs

I just wanted to vent, or I could have a better job with more income.  I am supposed to be a father and a provider and I can't even do that.  I am dreading Christmas morning, and wish I can just escape all of this.  

**UPDATE: Power bill almost completely paid up

**UPDATE 2: THANK YOU ALL!!!! The compassion is beyond amazing. Just a FYI almost all extra gifts, as well as some of the money. I will also be paying all this extra generosity to others who need it around me as well. Pictures will be posted for proof. Your all amazing and many tears have been shed today**

**UPDATE 3: Honestly everyone

**UPDATE 4: I see I am  getting a lot of hate now, PLEASE PLEASE DONATE TO OTHERS NOW!! We are beyond blessed at this point.  Let's make this an awesome one for others too!!**

**UPDATE 5: FINAL UPDATE: Thank you all again. i honestly can't say that enough I hope I helped some other people out as well. I need to get home and go to bed as I got work at 5AM.  Please No more donations you have all done so much already.  I am eternally grateful to all of you.  Pictures will be posted of Christmas and the gifts I have helped others with.  Goodnight and thank you.**

**ONE LAST UPDATE: I am trying my best to go through all of the submissions for help.  As of this morning over $1, car repairs, food money, and etc. Donations are also being made to a local community outreach center that helps with utilities and other hardships.  To answer just a few questions. People are skimming my pasts posts regarding me purchasing turn tables, records, and etc.  99% percent of those items were purchased at thrift stores and yard sales for pennies on the dollar.  That money came from many of the side jobs I do for extra cash, and everything that was posted was sold well over 6-8 weeks ago.

The reason I kept adding to the wish list was for the benefit of others that I know from my place of employment, she is a kid she didn't know any better.  

I am at work on break but I am trying to fill as many Christmas wishes with verification as possible, but they can ""hide"" it so no more donations will be made.  I sent the request by e-mail last night and I am hoping it will be taken down. For those sending negative hate, threatening e-mails and messages, and even death threats, please put that negative energy into helping others.  For everybody that donated and contributed, and sending positive message and vibes I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You are all wonderful people.

1370791839.0,1fzg4a,A video game saved my life.,CarelessMonday,3425,1278,317,"It's weird that I want to share this to you people

Harvest Moon saved my life.

I was bullied since I was a freshman in high school. I don't know the reason, a nerd, a lesbian, take your pick. I was depressed, I was angry, I wanted to kill myself, and I tried but I seem to have a tolerance for sleeping pills. Soon I just gave up. I feel like I wasn't alive
Gaming was my only escape from hell. Everyday after school, where I can feel alive again. Well one day, some of this kids beat me up and locked me in the old janitor's closet. Now a lot of people know that I have claustrophobia, so I was terrified for hours until they let me go, I cried when they just left and making me feel worthless. I thought for that moment, I would hang myself.

No more pills, I passed by the game store I frequent and saw a game on display. ""New Arrival"" it said on the case, it was a copy of Harvest Moon: Back to Nature .It was a simple cover art, it has Comic Sans, yet it mesmerized me.
Now I didn't know why I bought it

So I took it home.

I put it in the CD

I started to play.

As I played, getting to know them made me pretend I had friends. As night fell, I completely forgot I want to hang myself.
It was like magic. I now ignore all those bullies
In Mineral Town, lots of animals and vegetable to take care and make happy.I won races, shows, I played the ocarina in church, went to festivals, got married and had a kid. It feels as though my real life is there inside the game.
I was living my ideal life.

I loved the feeling that people need me

A happy person.
In time
I grew up, the Xbox, the 360, the PS3 and PC. Even though I still have some psychological damage and issues because of the bullying, like anger problems. I try to keep them in check for my sake and others.

So last month, I finally got that job as a programmer again, but it was out of town.  I had just enough money to relocate to the new city.  They became very hostile starting a few days before I left, accusing me of not loving them, and tore that cardboard covering that normally comes with it and threw it away.

I was on my way to the gym (I usually go it the mornings

I tried my best to smile and said hello. She wouldnt speak at first she was just crying. I asked if she was ok or if someone was trying to hurt her. She didnt speak so I kept talking. I told her my name. I said I wanted to help her. I will buy you dinner

Finally she agreed to let me buy her dinner and came back over the railing. I held her hand and we walked down the on ramp. There was a CHP officer waiting at the bottom. She started to get scared and wanted to go back. I made her look at me and I swore I wouldn't leave her side. I would stay with her every step of the way. I spoke to the officer and sat with her while another officer showed up. They asked what happened and Jane had me tell them. They had to take her to an ER and wouldnt let me sit with her in the squad car so I followed after I gave her my name and number. 

At the ER she was poked(for blood) and questioned and x rayed. She asked that I stay with her through all of it. I listened as I found out her history. Rape, in and out of foster homes. In between doctors and nurses we chatted. I showed her pictures of my dog and we talked about childhood pets. We talked about our favorite salads. About silly things. Once about God.  She told me about the man she was scared of. The reason she was on the bridge. He had threatened her family because she left him. She thought if she killed herself he would have no reason to hurt them. She loves her family and spoke with great pride about their jobs and her niece and nephew. She loves animals and children. She said one day she wanted to have a job to help foster kids have a place to go to be safe. and so they wouldnt get into trouble. She spoke about being at a group home and helping with the little ones that came in. About a three year old with rashes from neglect (being allowed to sit in his own waste for long periods of time). ABout kids being abused and feeling like they had nowhere to go. She said that after she was raped she felt like she was a target because people knew she had been vulnerable. 

We spoke for hours. I left when the nurse brought in a bed for sleeping. I asked her to call me when they sent her to a new hospital and I will bring her dinner. I promised her on that bridge I would buy her dinner.

The whole thing is surreal. I had no idea what I was doing. I was barely keeping a smile on my face

I want to tell people what I did. I want to tell them how scared I was and how she opened up to me afterwards but wouldnt say more than two words to doctors and nurses. I want to say

edit: THank you all for your kind words. They mean a lot to me. My closest friend is also a coworker and after I told her privately she convinced me to speak to my supervisor and ask for the day off. I am still very shaken and emotionally drained. I keep replaying what happened over and over in my head. I feel anxious. I will update you all when I have more news about how Jane is doing.

I'm hoping I get some old dude or woman so there's no sexual tension because I was embarassed enough telling my story to the triage nurse. Nope. In walk a resident and a nurse. Nurse was early twenties and the resident was late 20s. Thankfully they are courteous and polite so not too bad so far. They've likely seen worse anyways.

They first tried ice to get it soft but it didn't work. The resident then tries to bend out the ends of the key ring with pliars

Fuck. This resident in her late 20s is now lubing my shaft and trying to tug the key ring off. This isn't stimulating me at all... no clearly not making me more aroused or hard...

Doesn't matter. Key ring won't budge. Her and the nurse leave and they come back with a drill that has a diamond tipped bit. They tell me this will cut the key ring off and I'll be good to go.

She was a ""good Christian"" girl that, coincidentally slept her way around the school's male population.

Senior year

When we graduated

This morning I stopped for breakfast with my fiancé, ""Hey, didn't we go to school together?"" Yeah, we did, bitch. You ruined it for me.

But I just smiled and carried on a pleasant conversation. She told me that she went to that private school but dropped out a year later. She got pregnant and had two kids. She's taking online classes to get a degree in teaching. She works two jobs. Single mother. I went through the motions and told her that that all sounded nice. 

When it was time to go, the people that think they're ""all that"" end up with the short end of the stick. I never believed it, but it actually happened.

Maybe I'll throw in a reference to the Prodigal Son and kill a fatted calf for him. That's certainly what's expected of me.  That's certainly what my *son* expects of me.  He ~~wants~~ demands praise and forgiveness and a party and me to hug him and tell him it's all right.  Demands me to tell him how proud I am that he's made something of himself.

But I'm not

His mother and I gave him every opportunity we could.  I don't expect any praise for that, stable, comfortable, supportive home.  We were involved in his school, we introduced him to music (to the extent that any two people can; his mother was a damn good cellist, though) and sports and culture, we fed him healthy meals, we got in the best shape we'd ever been in since our 20s--and we let him stumble and fall and make mistakes and *get back up again*.   

He started shoplifting at 15.  The first time we caught him, and offered to pay for any damages.  The second time we caught him (this time with a pair of shoes), we did the same thing.  The third time, we started going to family therapy.  

Therapy seemed to go well, because the little shit had concocted some story about how we were a religious cult who raped him for breakfast every Saturday ... and the dumb chickenshit therapist actually believed him.  Rational heads prevailed, we fired that therapist, and he went through six more in as many months, until eventually we couldn't find anyone who would take him as a patient.

By 16, bongs, and crack pipes where he knew we'd eventually find them, just to fuck with us.  I know this because he said so, in those exact words.  He had his first intervention and first trip to rehab that year, and his first relapse.

He had to repeat a year of high school at 17, but I had nothing to go on but my own instincts, so all I could do was tell her parents to keep an eye on her.  No charges were ever pressed, and the family never spoke to me again after that, but they did pull both of their kids out of that school, and my son was furious at me for daring to not let him continue committing statutory rape.

He decided to try for ""normal"" rape later on.  While I was away, straddled her, put the blade to her throat, and slid his other hand inside her. 

I don't know exactly what happened next.  I know he held her down and tried to undress her.  I know she fought.  I know he stabbed her. I know she got away and locked herself in the bathroom before he could catch her; I hope that means she kicked him good in the balls.  I know she broke the window and screamed for help.  I know he ran.  I know she was lucky the ambulance got to her before she bled to death.  I know he called his friends to brag and beg a ride.  I know the police caught him.

I know if I'd been home

The state tried my son as an adult.  He pled out

I would be a liar if I said I didn't blame him for her death, sober when he climbed on top of her, sober when he raped her, sober when he stabbed her, sober when he ran, sober when he called his friends to brag, and sober when the police found him.  When I made the mistake of visiting him after the divorce, he laughed again and asked how it felt to have ""some prick take your bitch away.""

I should have killed him right there.  It is to my eternal shame that I did not.

They let him out after serving three years.  He spent the next six years on the streets, and would grace me every six months or so with a phone call demanding money.  Eventually I refused to talk to him unless it was to drive him back to rehab, and I stopped completely after he stole my wallet.  

Two years ago, and laughed about; he stayed outside.  He slashed my tires, threw a brick through a window, and drove off in her car.  His aunt had no idea that he'd taken or keys, or that he'd been armed the whole time.  She blamed me.

He guilted her into letting him stay with her, and here we are.  

In stark contrast to the ball of shit that is my son and his life, lawyers, skilled tradesmen, actors and musicians, academics, entrepreneurs, and career military.  I've seen a few start their own families.  And even the ones who've had a rough start, managed to pick themselves up again

My son has pretended to reform before.  He has even convinced himself once or twice.  But he always backslides, always hurts other people for his own short-sighted benefit.  His aunt is already at the stage where she is pretending she ""must have forgotten"" where she put some knickknack or piece of jewelry, and has already told me to fuck off after I've warned her of what my son can, will, and has done before, and what he will do again now that he thinks she is weak.  When he fucks up again, when he hurts someone else with his ceaseless bullshit, stupid hope I used to have that my son would ever amount to anything

But I have this cousin. She's sixteen years old. She is severely, but she doesn't want to and cries and throws a tantrum whenever someone tells her to just use the fucking toilet. 
Anyway, everyone gets her a cake and presents so she doesn't freak out. 
So today we went to a family gathering for my uncle's birthday. My family had been reminding me for weeks before to not forget to get Lizz (my cousin) a gift. 
So you know what? As a little protest
So when everyone is giving her gifts, As soon as My aunt tells her, ""Okay, Lizzie! No more gifts, that's all of 'em,"" Lizz FLIPPED OUT and she started screaming, saying she didn't remember opening her gift from me. So my Aunt asks me where my gift for her Is. I tell her I didn't get one for her.
So at this point
Now later when I'm getting ready to leave, and they all started telling me that it was ""only fair"" that I let her keep my DS, because, oh get this, apparently it was ""selfish and cruel"" Not give Lizz a gift. 

So now that stupid fucking retarded bitch has my brand New 3DS and my Animal Crossing

I honestly wish she was never born or was put up for adoption or something. I'm not mad that she's mentally handicapped

EDIT 3: Just got back from the post. The package with a dollar-store frisbee and a candy bar are on its way to Liz. I should get my 3DS back in the mail sometime next week.

*****EDIT 4: I just want to apologize for being insensitive about my cousin. It's not her fault she was raised badly, or even a less asshole-ish term for that matter. I just need to give her and my aunt a break, I get that now. I just had a phone call with Lizz, and she said she can't wait for her frisbee to come in the mail. Honestly I was just a complete dick to get that angry over a damn *toy* and I really need to gt my priorities straight and I should stop being narrow minded about the whole thing.

1357934880.0,16ea8u,I am a girl who was raped by another girl. ,abrogatedsuffering,1394,236,244,"Reddit, fear
    
""Marie"" was the daughter of my mom's best friend, involved in all kinds of city stuff, politics, business clubs and social stuff.     
    
Marie was almost a year older than me
     
As we got older she started pecking at my self-esteem. I was skinny and nerdy with boring hair. I wore boys jeans and didn't need a bra until I was 17. She started wearing a bra when we were in the 4th grade. She got curvy and started buying clothes in women's sizes in the 5th grade.     
     
Marie was psychologically abusive. She said stuff like she was trying to make me feel better, like when she talked me into bleaching my hair, then told everyone I didn't have the skin for a blonde. She sabotaged my friendships with other people by telling us opposite stories, so we each thought the other did or said something wrong. She told boys I liked that I thought they were pigs, and boys who were mean to me that I had crushes on them. Marie was popular, and I was seen as her socially awkward friend. Everyone thought she was so nice for tolerating me. She told people she had to be nice because she was my only friend, and what would I do without her?     
    
In a way she *was* my only friend. She manipulated me into letting her control my life. She pretended to be protective, and sometimes did them, too. She threatened boys who talked to me too much and made nasty accusations. She always had to get between me and other girls. She would warn me that they were just trying to find things about me to gossip about. She would trick me into making myself look bad and then tell me what the other girls were saying about me. She had me thinking she was protecting me, but all the time I walked on eggshells to keep from setting her off.     

That all started when we were in 5th grade. Mom got a new job that had her working out of town, things were okay. One day the class was separated into boys and girls, and we got the talk about periods and pregnancy. I don't know why or if this is normal, but we also got told how to masturbate, and that we should do that instead of having sex with boys because it wouldn't give us diseases or get us pregnant. I remember at the time that sex and masturbation both sounded gross to me. I decided I was never getting married. Marie laughed at me for that and told some of the other girls. Some of them agreed. Some of them called me weird. I felt like a freak, but I didn't defend myself. I didn't even know what to say.     
    
The next time we had an overnight, grabbed my arms, rolled over on me and pinned me. There was no one to call, because her mom was at a meeting and my mom was out of town. I fought back but she was stronger and heavier. I could hardly breathe with her on top of me. While I turned my face away and cried, she forced my hands inside her pajamas. When I didn't do what she wanted, she let go and hit me until I obeyed. She told me what to do, and I did it until she came. When it was over, instead of her. She also told me that if I tried to tell anyone about it, so I just didn't react. I didn't tell anyone what happened
    
This isn't anything like what they show in lesbian porn. I didn't start liking it. She didn't do anything for me, and I am straight. I didn't want anything about what happened. It was horrible, scary, humiliating, and gross, but I was afraid to talk to anyone about it. Our town was really small. We only had one building for school. Everyone knew everyone else, and almost everyone went to the same church. Everyone knew and respected Marie's mom. Other adults treated her like gold because she was her mom's daughter. Anything I said would have made me look like a liar and a freak
     
The one time I did try to talk to the junior high guidance counselor about it, who spent a year of very traumatic sessions curing me of my ""delusion"" until I gave up trying to get help and went along with what she said to me. My last session was writing a letter of apology to Marie. Even though I never had to give it to her, the helplessness and wrongness I felt was bad enough to give me nightmares about the whole town finding out and coming down on me like the shrink did. I was always afraid after that, wondering who the guidance counselor had told and which teachers might see me as a lying freak with lesbian rape fantasies. Sometimes the thought would hit me in class, and I wouldn't be able to look at anyone. It made me very awkward sometimes when teachers called on me for questions. I got yelled at a lot for not answering loud enough to be heard. Ironically, Marie was the one who would commiserate with me between classes about what a bully the teacher was when that happened, and even though she was the one causing the problem
    
The abuse continued for years. As we got older, making me go down on her, slapping me when I gagged, mocking me when I cried. It stopped when we were in high school, when my mom's job transferred her out of the area, and we moved. Finding out that we were leaving was the most exciting day of my life. We would be far enough away that I would be free from Marie. I was scared to start over in a new school, but I decided that I'd rather just not have friends than face another night at her house. I also decided I was never going back to that little town again. In the end
    
I'm not writing this to make you feel sorry for me. Now that I am older I feel stronger and am starting to recover. I'm taking classes and moving on with my life. I just wanted you to know that sometimes, and where I would get a chance to explain why I was saying it. ",,False,,t5_2ranw,False,,

Today was my sons birthday, when I went to get his present, I realized I'd lost my wallet. I sat in the parking lot of Gamestop for over an hour crying. I'm crying now. I don't understand why we can't catch a break. I was so excited, I was going to finally replace his DS that he lost in the house fire with a 3DS XL, mario, and pokemon. It's all he wanted.

I know he was heartbroken, and that he didn't care that we couldn't get one, but that right now he misses his memaw(grandmother, who died recently) because she always made his special cake.

We're running out of options, then we'll have a house...but listening to my son cry, knowing he was heartbroken. It killed me, I feel so guilty. If I hadn't lost my wallet, he would have had some joy in his life. I feel like somehow I took that away from his special day. I couldn't even afford cupcakes for him to take to his school today. 

I'm a complete and utter failure of a father, but today that doesn't matter, today I wanted to shield you from it, and give you some joy. I know purchasing the 3DS would have been slightly irresponsible, but we've only got a week before Daddy gets paid big boy. And then we'll have a house, with your own room.

My reaction surprised me. Instead of freezing in my seat and staring or looking around confused or running away from the accident

The woman driving the car stopped and got out of her car, I told her that she had done the right thing. She stopped. She didn't drive away and the girl was talking, and probably in shock, but didn't appear to have a scratch on her. I told her it would be a good idea to move her car to somewhere safe (not blocking traffic) and she went to move it. When she came back I tried to comfort her by just putting my hand on her shoulder. I told her to breathe. Next, I noticed she was wearing a work uniform and suggested she call work to let them know she'd be late. She did, and soon the girl's mom, police

The mom could see how horrified/frantic/tearful the poor woman was and saw her seemingly uninjured daughter and gave the frightened woman a big hug. The woman who hit her daughter with a car!

A couple of years ago I was around 14-15 and watched the show Secret Millionaire on Hulu. I don't remember too many of the details but I remember the millionaire was helping this low income man distribute toiletries to the homeless in whatever town they were in. The man saw that one of the homeless men had stepped in shit and his shoes were absolutely ruined so he asked him his shoe size. The homeless man said he was a size nine and without hesitation the other man took his shoes off and handed them to him. 


I remember I started to tear up when I saw that and told myself that before I die I need to do something like that. 

So a couple of nights ago I was with my two friends and we were walking to my car from a concert around 10 at night. We are approaching my car and I am supposed to give both of them rides home so they are trailing behind me. Within ten feet to my car a man was pushing a cart full of trash bags

At this moment without hesitation

""Excuse me
He looks at me.

""Do you have any shoes?""

""Well

""What's your shoe size?""

""Like a twelve I think""

I swear it was meant to be because I am a size twelve. I had a pair of [Nike Shox](http://www.lookjordan.com/images/Sneakers/Nike%20Shox/Shox%20Agent/Nike%20Shox%20Agent+%20Men%20Shoes%20in%20Grey%20and%20Blue.jpg) that were in really good condition and slipped them off and handed them to him. 

He looks at me and I just smiled ear to ear. 

""You sure man?""

I replied ""Yeah keep 'em!"" and shook his hand. 

He said thank you and I walked to the driver side of my car and told him to have a nice night. 

My friends were telling me how they were holding back tears but in the spur of the moment I honestly forgot they were with me.

*Edit 01/04/2013:* I just wanted to let everyone know that the manager has finally contacted me. He apologized over and over again. He also scheduled me for another interview next Wednesday at 2pm. I am currently trying to decide if I should go

*Edit 01/04/2013:* I've been contacted by Cracker Barrel and they are trying to work things out and figured out what went wrong. I posted a full update on my [blog](http://hellozachary.blogspot.com/) 

**Original post below:**


Got there 15 minutes early and didn't leave the building 'til five o'clock. You are probably thinking, huh? Well, I never actually had my interview. Let me give you a timeline of how I spent my 2+ hours at Cracker Barrel. 

**3:00pm:** A server tells me the manager should be out soon.

**3:05pm:** I tap my foot gently to the country music they have playing inside.

**3:07pm:** I watch a man eat two buttermilk biscuits in less than 60 seconds. He looks happy.

**3:10pm:** The little peg game they have on every table is tempting me

**3:15pm:** A female sits down next to me and she reveals that she has an interview scheduled for 3:15

**3:16pm:** I try not to make eye contact with her because I am shy and afraid of people. 

**3:17pm:** Shit...shit! I made eye contact and now I must say something so I don't look creepy.

**3:18pm:** Do you live around here? I ask her

**3:20pm:** Another girl comes up to the round table. She reveals that she has an interview scheduled for 3:30

**3:22pm:** I wonder what came first; the cracker or the barrel?

**3:23pm:** A server tells us that the manager is in a meeting but should be out real soon.

**3:24pm:** I start to prepare myself for the interview. Firm handshake

**3:26pm:** A waiter talks to me and the two girls. Tells us not to worry about the interview

**3:30pm:** I begin to wonder what is taking so long. Also

**3:33pm:** The two girls at the table start to talk with each other. I look down at the table and try to look busy. 

**3:40pm:** One of the nice waitresses looks at me and says something like

**3:45pm:** Another girl sits down at the table. She says that she has an interview scheduled for 4pm. I begin to wonder if I am getting Punk'd.

**3:50pm:** The new girl asks how long we've all been there. We tell her and she seems shocked.

**3:53pm:** One of the girls begins to complain about waiting so long. I kind of laugh but inside I am thinking

**3:55pm:** We're offered something to drink by the wait staff

**4:00pm:** An attractive female in the gift shop looks at me. Does she like me? Nah

**4:01pm:** I look back to see if the attractive female is still looking at me. She's not. 

**4:05pm:** We're offered drinks again

**4:06pm:** The girls at the table start talking about how ""ridiculous"" this is. And then they start talking about past jobs

**4:08pm:** A waitress says she thinks that he's still in the meeting

**4:09pm:** I say

**4:10pm:** I look back in the gift shop and notice the attractive female is looking at me again. Do I have something on my face? Or a ""kick me"" sign on my back?

**4:13pm:** A customer at a table nearby orders hot chocolate and it looks so fucking good.

**4:15pm:** Another waitress offers us drinks and we finally accept the offer. I just got some water. I was thinking about the hot chocolate

**4:18pm:** I glance back at the gift shop and see that the attractive female is still in there. I try to keep the dirty thoughts away; this would be a bad time for a surprise boner. 

**4:20pm:** Everyone at the table agrees that this is a bit ridiculous. Why hasn't he at least come out to say he's running a bit (or a lot) behind? We all question.

**4:23pm:** We all agree that we should get the job just because of the long wait.

**4:25pm:** I make eye contact with one the first waitresses who talked to me. She gives me a

**4:30pm:** One of the girl's cell phone says it's 5:30pm. We all panic and wonder if it really is 5:30. It wasn't...her phone was just messing up. 

**4:32pm:** I watch someone eat some pork chops. I don't really like pork chops

**4:34pm:** The attractive female is still in the gift shop. I start to wish I had confidence. 

**4:39pm:** Still no sign of the manager. 

**4:41pm:** I finish my glass of water and begin to twirl the straw around in the ice. I stop a few minutes later because I think people are getting annoyed.

**4:45pm:** We all are getting extremely annoyed. We're left there waiting...and waiting. 

**4:48pm:** One of the girls goes outside for a smoke break.

**4:50pm:** Girl comes back inside and asks me how old I am. I inform her that I am 21 and shes like

**4:55pm:** I decide that if the manager doesn't come out by 5pm then I am leaving. 

**5:00pm:** No sign of the manager, ""Probably not"" and walk out the door. 

**5:03pm:** I think about how I just wasted over two hours waiting on a shitty manager who doesn't have the decency to at least come out and apologize. 

**6:30pm:** I arrive at home and eat me a bowl of corn chex with sliced up bananas. Still mad...but my anger decreases with every bite. 

**7:57pm:** I post this on Reddit.

**10:23pm:** I'll probably be in the bathroom thinking about the attractive female in the gift shop.

I am going to call a cab and take her to the vet again. I don't think I can say i saw what happened but I will tell him I think that maybe a friend did something to her like that and get them to check her better. 
I never thought she could get hurt enough from it to die but now I am really scared for her. 
If she is okay and not hurt then I will think about it but if she is really hurt inside I will tell dad somehow. If he wants to throw me out I will take her with me and keep her safe at least.

Mom was a drunk, bio mom took her youngest (5yrs old) to a picnic party at a local park. Busy chatting with ppl and not watching (!!!!) a man dragged her daughter out of view, stuffed his fingers down her throat to silence her, and raped her....FIVE YEARS OLD YOU SICK DISGUSTING PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!!

At the hospital the first person she asked for (she could hardly speak bc of his fingers ripping up her throat) was our friends. She wanted her foster daddy there to make sure that the man who hurt her couldn't get to her. The police know who it was

This POS has caused so much damage to her reproductive parts that she will need extensive reconstruction surgery

The police however have not told them if they got a confession yet (they don't need one. DNA has him dead to rights). I'm going to propose the both sets of parents that perhaps the best way Reddit can help would be letters to the future Judge in this case asking to throw out any attempt at plea bargaining and ask for the max sentence allowable by law upon conviction.

It became too much for her. She hung herself in her bedroom.  

While this sounds completely and unforgivably fucked up, to her mother, to her sister, her Godson, her boyfriend, her friends, and her entire family.  To her dog. She left herself hanging there, to be found

It was pretty meticulously planned out.  She had cleaned her room, even changed her profile picture on Facebook.  All of this planning went into her suicide, all of this thought.  
She had been in trouble for a long time. Suicide was something that was almost constantly on her mind for years.  She was also beautiful, the best friend that I’ve ever had.  A sweet girl, a little derpy, who was socially awkward and had big dreams and a tiny bank account.

See the thing is, protect, heal.  People who serve their communities and neighbors, trying to keep the city clean and safe and healthy, instead being called in to cut down a 22 year old hanging from her hammock.  Human beings who don’t know what to say, can’t even look at the people who called 911. Who have to take pictures of it, by law.  I know that police officers are supposed to be badass, but I have never seen that kind of absolute horror on someone’s face before.

She planned out her outfit, how unbelievably nightmarish that particular process would be for us.  What do we do with her toothbrush? Her favorite shoes, all worn out and dirty, by the door?  All of her belongings, 22 years worth, dresses and books and shampoo, packed in boxes and sitting in the living room of her mother’s tiny apartment. A literal mountain of grief.

She didn’t think about who would have to call her mother. She didn’t think about how completely impossible it is to bring up “oh, how it would wipe out everything her immigrant family has broken their backs struggling and saving for decades. How many details go into planning them.  The impossible situation of trying to plan a wake, funeral, and burial when your world has literally come to an end. 

When you die, find you a funeral home, get in contact with everybody you know. Somebody needs to find you something to wear.  Somebody needs to plan your makeup.  Somebody needs to pick you out a coffin. Make sure you get in that coffin. Hire a car equipped to drive that coffin around.  Find you a grave.  Get everybody you knew into a cohesive, informed organization.  Make sure that your mother didn’t succeed in following you.  Figure out where the fucking world you buy tombstones from.  It’s all the work of planning a Super Sweet 16 at a moment’s notice except your heart has physically been ripped out of your chest and all your guts are leaking out everywhere.

When you die, this causes extra gut-leaking.  

When you die, your Godkids still have birthdays.  When you die, your mom still tries to call you on Sunday afternoons. 

I almost would have preferred that she had been murdered. It would be possible to accept her death as a murder.  There were ways she could have made it look like an accident.  

I sound like the most selfish fucked up excuse for a human being, I feel like this might actually kill me.  I am so angry and pissed off because I feel like there was absolutely no purpose behind this.  Intellectually, I know that she was sick, but personally, I know that she didn’t have to die. There is always somewhere to go. There is always another course of action.  All those issues that loomed so large before she died were temporary situations. Time goes on no matter what, and nothing lasts forever.  She could have gone home to Peru, to her mother’s house

Of course, paralyzing, nauseating feeling can manifest in my consciousness. She knew we would find her. She knew we would have to clean up after her, call her mother, look at her lying there on that steel table in the basement of the hospital with a giant ridge in her neck and her tongue split in half.  She needed us to know that it was our fault.  She needed us to know just how badly we had failed her.  She was so angry with us, this was the only thing she could do to demonstrate the depths of her disappointment in the people, the society

And you know what? We really


Anyway

I was so scared of her as a kid because she was big and would scream and hit me for no reason (that I could ever figure out). She would kick me when she walked past and giggle about it, and of course they believed her. She constantly stole stuff

And she was fucking disgusting. She would regularly go into the bathroom and wipe shit on the toilet seat, including rotting food. She would blow her nose into her hands and rub them together like it was soap. She also had some sort of weird fungal thing on her nails that never really cleared up, despite going to the doctor numerous times and getting medication. Her nails were all yellowed and warped and cracked for years, like something out of a horror movie. I hated her and I'm certain she disliked me too. She was just so mean, like a 5 year old bully in an adult’s body. Yet whenever she met someone new she was all smiles and hugs, so everyone always told me about how friendly and precious she was. The worst was how sexual she could be. She would practically try to molest me, she would rub on me and grab between my legs. She’d flash me or try to pull down my pants or wiggle her butt in my face. I don’t know where she could have learned it from, you can’t blame her” and made her leave the room whenever I yelled for them. I remember this as young as six (and you can bet every time I pushed her away or hit her then I was the one who got in trouble) and all the way up until I graduated. It happened to friends that I brought over in high school too. Most people were (understandably) extremely uncomfortable by it and wouldn’t come to my house after it happened to them.  

After I graduated I moved out and went to college. I thought about it for a long time and decided that I was just jealous because she got everyone’s attention, she still spits on me and thinks it’s funny, she still shits all over the wall, she still steals things out of my bag and shows me her boobs. She does all this to my parents too but somehow they can just accept it, they get annoyed for a bit and tell her to stop, then they forget about it. Well not me. I hate her and I hate how everyone tells me she’s such a blessing, and I hate how everyone expects me to get involved with raising her after our parents can no longer do so. I already told our parents that that will never happen, out of duty or guilt or something. If so they are grossly mistaken.

I saw a $20 dollar bill floating across the ground. I snatched it up

First thought I had was ""Holy shit"", and finally decided I was going to turn it in to the lost and found.

When I told the lost and found that I had found money on the parking lot and wanted to turn it in, and if no one did then I could have it. After I turned it in, I went to my class as normal.

As I was heading to my last class, and she just started crying on the phone, breaking down in tears and thanking me from the bottom of her heart. I was shocked, I didn't think it would mean that much to anyone. I came to find out however, that this woman had been loaned that money from her parents to buy medication for her sick baby, and had lost it in her rush to get to class on time. 

I don't think I have ever felt so good about something in my entire life

Now

After this incident, and my grandparents. None were happy with me. My friends told me I had done a stupid thing and should have held onto the money, that I could have bought all kinds of games with it. My mother told me she was 'sort of' proud of me, but thinks I should halve kept the money since I had found it. My grandparents were just flat out disappointed in me, they thought it was stupid I had given back the money. They said I could have put it towards something I wanted, and that it was the woman's fault for loosing it. No one cared about the baby who was sick, or how grateful the woman was for me turning the money in. No one gave a shit about the fact I had tried to do something good

So now, and even my boyfriend says I should have just held onto it. ""Finders Keepers.""

Was it really so damn wrong of me to actually do something selfless? I don't regret it

Last night, she ended up getting a phone call from her daughter at 3:45 in the morning. Her daughter was alone and scared in the middle of the city after being ditched by my daughter. Apparently they'd snuck out of the house and been wandering all over town. This girl had gotten scared and uncomfortable, and my daughter basically told her, fine then, I'll go on without you. 

I immediately confiscated my daughter's phone and demanded the password. Upon looking through her phone, many of them older guys who consistently ask for ""special photos"". There were no nude photos, but some very suggestive selfies of her in a string bikini. There were hundreds of pictures of pot and pipes, movies of her and friends toking up, and several movies of what looked like a rave in an abandoned house. Apparently these things have happened right under my roof, or when she's staying overnight at a girlfriend's house (which has been fairly often, given school's still out for summer).

In conversations with her friends

I am a stay-at-home mom. I talk with her frequently. She's always told me, but in conversations with friends claimed otherwise ... saying she's fucked &lt;name&gt; twice and would like to be ""bent over"" by several others.

I am WTF-ing so hard right now and I feel I've done everything wrong and that there's no way this kid can possibly get back to being an honest girl with personal goals that don't involve getting high

I want to run away. I really do. Wash my hands of this. I hate my daughter right now

EDIT: And for the few finding fault with my use of the term ""skank"" ... I am getting this off my chest. Chill. I haven't used that sort of terminology with her or my other kids.

Then suddenly, but it was snowing after all. As I saw her coming closer, I saw a concerned and frightened look on her face. She had seen me, and I take it she knew that this particular bridge was common for jumpers. Somehow, I felt ashamed, I didn't want her to stop to consolidate me or feel the need to call for help. So I put my jacket back on, and kept walking in the same direction as bicycle-woman was going. She caught up with me asked quickly if I was OK, went home.

After that, somehow got a job sorting mail and handing out fruit-baskets in the office of an electrical company. My boss was a kind man, he made me feel important and needed. And I really felt I was doing something good when I saw how happy the employees of this company became when they got a basket of fruit. Suddenly, I had the money to rent a room of my own, and one of my flatmates was the sweetest guy ever. He pushed me into getting therapy and I got better. I'm not always OK, but I'm definitely better. Oh, and he proposed last summer. 

After a few years of odd jobs, I got a scholarship to go to uni. I started at 25 - a bit later than most, but ah, better late than never. I'm graduating next year. 

I went to this forum to post this because a song came on the radio today that reminded me of how awful I used to feel. When I was standing on that bridge, I thought no-one could ever love me. I'd been the bullied, skinny, awkward girl all my life. I had terrible OCD that kept me awake washing my hands and face all night, and that made me think everyone around me would be killed by my mere presence. I self-harmed in every thinkable way, had no job, nowhere to live, no family

When I sit back and look at my life now, and enough so that me and my fiancé can go out to eat sometimes. We have a little rental flat and a group of friends from work and uni that we meet sometimes for beer. And as soon as I'm a bit closer to finishing uni, we hope to start trying for a baby.

I usually tip 15-20% whenever I eat out and unless some major gripes with the service

But some servers need to realize that the tip is gratuity for a service they provide.  And if no service is provided

I was eating out with a couple friends at lunch today and it took them 10 minutes just to come get our orders.  15-20 minutes later

Another 15 minutes pass, and both orders were WRONG.  We figured, screw it, the food didn't look half bad, and we had to run soon, so whatever.  and not once during the entire hour was our water refilled.  another 5-10 minutes pass and still no food for the rest of the party.  Finally, with so much attitude, and offered us the food that was sitting at the next table.  The patrons at the next table had gotten fed up and left and the food was sitting there for 10 minutes.  Seriously?  You're going to offer food that was sitting at another table to us?

Finally we just said forget it

The bill was $35 and we paid *exactly* that.  No tips because of how shitty the service was.  And we proceeded to leave.

The waiter ran up to me -- funny how inattentive he was during our entire meal, blablabla and I told him to fuck off.

Fuck these types of places and people.

I've known since I met her, she succeeded.

If you'll lend your screens

She was 28 or 29. She learned to cover her Southern accent because apparently Minnesotans judge southerners rather harshly. She had a really beautiful smile, then the more she went to therapy, the more she swore. She loved so very deeply, even strangers. She volunteered, gave of herself at all times. I wish she hadn't given so deeply of herself, she deserved some of the wonderfulness of her.

She was incredibly kind. She loved the Ninja Turtles, despite being an atheist, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. She wrote Star Trek Christian fanfiction. She would sing ""Therapy Time Down By The Bay"" with me ad nauseum. Listing these things makes me feel like she was special needs, or something, but really, she was so very herself that she just enjoyed whatever she goddamn well pleased and made no apologies.

She was a terrible cook. One time, and substituted kale and peas for broccoli. Then burned the mixture.We agreed that boobs were awesome, and we'd both make a point to squeeze ours in front of each other when we were sure no boys were looking.

She was so good with children. Her two cousins, loved her incredibly. She knew exactly how to deal with any kids.

She traveled rather extensively. She let me share her room when my own house was too far from school to commute with my rigorous schedule for a few weeks.

She was the best kind of Christian. She dearly loved everyone. She did SO much work with the homeless, but she didn't love herself anywhere as much as she should have. She was beautiful. She wore skirts over pants and looked ridiculous but rocked that shit out. She spoke Klingon. Despite her religious beliefs, she laughed and loved me when I told her about sending a picture of my boobs to a guy. She laughed and loved me all the time, and I loved her and I still love her.

1363203566.0,1a8gv3,The girl who cried rape.,desearemyconfessions,839,172,322,"TL;DR: My friend falsely accused a guy of raping her

I'm so fucking pissed. Fuck shit damn ass bitch cunt wtf.
Apparently I'm a ""sell out"" and a ""bad friend"" because I won't lie for my 'best friend' about a guy raping her. 

Backstory;
Me and my friend were hanging out with these two guys. 
I knew from the get go that these guys were trouble
So we're at (we'll call him Todd)'s house. His friends (fake) name is Mike. 
Todd brings out some liquor and we all start drinking.

(Now before I go any further
I am completely aware of the fact that there is a point when a girl has drank too much and it IS rape if a guy has sex/does sexual things with her. This was not the case.
She had a few shots, walking, and rationally thinking.)

This is when things start to take a turn for the worse...
My friend decides to suck Todds dick in front of everyone. (mfw..) She did not protest to doing it
She even went as far to swallow, ""It didn't taste bad!""

Okay. That was fucking weird
I was fucking wrong.

She then decides to strut over to Mike and start making out with him and give him a handjob. He was taking off her pants, etc.
They didn't actually have sex

Five minutes later
(By the way

A lot happened that night but that bit was the only piece you need to hear

Me: ""I cannot believe what you did last night!"" 
Her: ""Oh my gosh I know! It was so funny!""
Me: *jokingly* ""You sucked Todds dick in front of everybody! WITH NO SHAME TOO!""
Her: *laughing* ""I swear I looked around and didn't see anybody!""
Me: *laughing* ""Cmon now don't lie!"" 
Her: *laughing* ""Well it didn't taste bad!""

I can honestly say that me and her joked about what she did for a two full weeks after it happened.
She thought the whole thing was HILARIOUS.
She said she didn't care about what happened

So up until this point
She had a crazy night and did some dumb shit
That is until about two and half (maybe three) weeks after the whole ordeal.
I had just walked through the door to my house when my phone started ringing.
And as you may have guessed

Her: ""You need to come over right now. I told my mom and aunt about what happened and we're going to the police.""
Me: ""What the fuck are you talking about?""
Her: ""I told them about me and Todd and they want to press charges.""
Me: ""What do you mean? Why would they press charges?""
*Her mom takes the phone.*
HM: ""He's not going to get away with raping her. We need you to tell the cops what happened.""
Me: ""What? He didn't rape her
*Friend takes the phone.*
Her: ""He forced me to suck his dick. I was so drunk and he forcefully made me do it.""
Me: ""What about Mike? He did that stuff with you after you sucked Todds dick. If you were too drunk for the Todd thing
Her: ""No
(That makes no fucking sense...)
Me: ""But Todd didn't force you to do anything. I was there the whole time
*Her mom takes the phone.*
HM: I need you to tell us the complete truth about what happened that night.

Long story short
I even told them about how she was laughing and joking about it

After telling them the truth about what happened they decided not to go to the cops.

I was kind of mad at the fact that she was lying to her family just to get attention
I thought that would be the end of everything

She tells me a few weeks later
Me: ""What the fuck? How the fuck am I a bad friend? We've been best friends for years and I've ALWAYS had your back
Her: ""Yeah but you didn't have to tell my mom about how I was joking about it.""
Me: ""If I wouldn't have told her then she would've gone to the cops and ruined that boys life. That's fucked up.""

Me and her went back and forth for a little bit

WHAT THE FUCK. FUCK YOU GUYS. 
YOUR FUCKING DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT TO RUIN SOME KIDS LIFE OVER SOMETHING THAT HE DIDN'T FUCKING DO.
I WAS NOT ABOUT TO BE APART OF PUTTING SOMEONE IN JAIL IF THEY DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING DO ANYTHING WRONG.
YOU GUYS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE FOR THINKING IT'S OKAY TO THROW AROUND FALSE RAPE CLAIMS.
YOU THINK I'M A BAD PERSON FOR TELLING THE FUCKING TRUTH
NO FUCK THAT.
RAPE ISN'T A WORD TO USE LIGHTLY. THAT'S SOME SERIOUS SHIT THAT FUCKS PEOPLES LIVES UP.
HE COULD HAVE WENT TO JAIL FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG
I'M A BAD PERSON FOR NOT BEING OKAY WITH THAT? 
I'VE HAD YOUR BACK THROUGH EVERYTHING
YOU GUYS SHOULD FEEL FUCKING ASHAMED.
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND OVER THIS RETARDED ASS SHIT. IT FUCKING SUCKS

I'm so FUCKING mad.
I understand that she regrets what she did. If she would've just came to me and been like
But she NEVER told me that he forced her to do it

But no! I'm the fucking devil because I wasn't okay with falsely accusing somebody of rape!

I know what it's like to do something and regret it afterwards
I fucking HATE girls like that.
You were completely fine with doing it when it was actually happening

GROW THE FUCK UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.
YOU WERE ALL FOR DOING WHAT YOU DID THAT NIGHT
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE FUCKING PERSON.

Me and my best friend get to my house and we are taking shots 
waiting for the other friend to get there. An hour or so later (I'm pretty buzzed at this point) my other friend shows up with 2 guys. Did she call and say she was bringing people? No. Did she even ask if it was ok? No. Oh and who does she bring? The guy she is talking to and the guy my other friend has an NSA type relationship with. 

Whatever I think I am pretty drunk and we are all sitting in my room drinking chilling when the first two get up to go smoke on the patio. Ok fine whatever. Then my best friend has to ""pee"" and of course she can't pee alone so he goes with her. So here I am alone, on my birthday. So I just start crying. For a good 45 minutes I just cry and I look at the clock it's 3am at this point. I go to find them to tell them time to go when what do I see everyone sitting together having a grand old time. No one thought to come get me or see if I'm ok or anything. Oh and look my ""best"" friend is belligerent drunk. 

I send everyone home and my ""best"" friend was planning on sleeping over anyway so now its just us two and she gets like all super drunk girls get, empty glasses ect while she is passed out. 

Real special birthday for me. I mean I know she is an attention whore and 9/10 I don't mind because I'm not the type that likes attention

**Edit:** thanks everyone for listening! I know I should talk to her and tell her how it made me feel but I'm scared of losing her. I don't have very many friends and I guess I feel like having friends like this is better than being alone.  Stupid I know. Also every time I have tried to talk to her about how something makes me feel or anything basically not about her and about me she has a way of spinning things and in the end I feel so stupid for even bringing it up. But I am going to try again. Wish me luck! 

**Edit 2:** Talked to her this morning and she basically said that I was making a big deal out of nothing because it was a Monday night what else were we going to do? She offered to take me out this weekend

**Edit 3:** She just texted me saying let's go to Hollywood tonight I'll find someone to drive us so you can have fun. I told her I don't feel like going to Hollywood. I didn't go see her at lunch today (I usually take her lunch since we work very close to each other) but she hasn't come to see me so I dono. I am not sure if she feels bad or she is just trying to play catch-up. 

I randomly texted an old friend who was actually the first person to wish me a happy birthday and told him I was feeling down/about the situation and he said that he insisted we go have fun. I wasn't expecting it at all but who knows!

But I'm a bit out of date. I've been a bit busy this last year. Heck.. the last eight. I've lived in six countries. Fought in two wars. I learned two foreign languages to boot. And tourist level for the countries I fought in too. Enough to know the important polite things. And the work related ones like ""Where did he go?"" ""How many"" and ""Get down or I will shoot you.""

And when I've had free time, I've done a bit of poetry too. When I'm in the states, I volunteer my time with whatever local shelter or charity could use a carpenter or electrician or plumber. I do all three. He can't even patch a punctured tire. I know because I patched his before we came to the bar.

And when he wowed you with his masters degree and his talk of considering philosophy a bit of a hobby.. I let you go. I don't have a degree. Don't need one. I can recite Niccolo Machiavelli and Robert Greene. I can debate the relative merits of political systems in practice and on paper. I can tell you all about the -real- American history. The fascinating things that make our American past into something plausible.. something believable. Stories that make our founding fathers back into real people. Back into men. Men you can laugh at and with. And admire all the more for seeing behind the myth.

I explain why a car's engine works and how an aerofoil keeps a plane aloft. I can talk about art history and the Melancholic Sublime movement. I'm a senior member of two art museums donating every year and attending events when I can

And you picked a lying

Maybe.. just maybe I'm not.

Fast forward to age 17, but my parents thought it would be ""too much to put us through"". I later found out that my mom had no idea of these payments. 

Around the same time

The next morning, and my sisters had their own addictions. I felt like I couldn't come clean to anyone about what was going on in my life. A few days later, New Year's Eve 2009, I was on the verge of suicide, and I found an opportunity later that day.

 I was driving down an icy road and a [presumably drunk] driver drove me off the road. I remember driving through the woods basically and thinking ""this is it"". Instead of braking

I was awoken by a young guy, I don't remember what I told this guy but I remember he kept repeating things like ""this is your second chance"". The weird thing is that this guy probably saved my life, and I have absolutely no record of him-- from police reports, witness statements, etc. no one could find him.  

When I got out of the hospital the next day, and even luckier in that my boyfriend had never been at my house. He lived about 30 minutes away. Within a week I changed my number , found a therapist, and went to an NA meeting. (I didn't end up following through with NA because I was able to stop the coke use with a therapist.)

I am now at a great school about 6 hours away from my hometown, I slept for 9 straight hours last night! I'm cool with answering questions but I just needed to tell this to someone.

What makes being friendly and non-confrontational ""not black""? How is speaking English correctly (or how they say it

We complain about the stereotypes that are attributed to us but then when someone is different
I'm tired of being called ""white"" because I don't fit the description of a ""typical black person"". Even my non-black friends say I'm ""white-washed"" or ""asian-washed""

1359055549.0,177f96,Thank you r/offmychest after getting 5th wheeled you guys gave me the courage to stand up for myself. Update of how much you all have helped me inside.,argirl09,698,104,106,"So I got fifth wheeled on my birthday [original thread](http://redd.it/172mae) and you guys helped me realize that I don't need a shitty best friend. This is simply an update of how I used what everyone told me on here especially u/ya_tu_sabes so here is what happen last night and this morning.

**Update** For any of you still reading this thread last night the old friend I texted came to my work to take me out. Where I work there is a bar within walking distance so we just went there. My ""best"" friend called me up because she was off work and needed a ride home. I told her I'm at the bar with ""Jon"" who she also knows (better than me even) she said eww why and I told her because he made an effort to make me happy on my birthday, has let the bartenders know the situation and they are just pumping it out so I am very drunk at this point. In comes ""best"" friend. 

Her: Are you drunk? 

Me: Yupppppp

Her: Who's going to take me home?

Jon: She's gonna have a good time tonight if you want to join in on that you can if you don't then go home.

Me: Wheeee (I'm drunk) 

She ends up staying and texting on her phone the whole time until Jon and I decide to go have hookah she wants to come too. (She doesn't drive pretty sure she is using us for a ride but I am to drunk to care) 
Get to the hookah lounge and again she is on her phone but I just don't care. Then Jon gets up to go to the bathroom. Here she takes her shot. 

Her: I can't believe you're hanging out with Jon. He is so annoying. You know I don't like him. 

Me: (I've sobered up a bit but just intoxicated enough to not let fear get the best of me) Well this isn't your night. I like hanging out with him

Her: *blank stare* 

Me: When he found out I'm upset he came to cheer me up which is more then you've done. 

Her: I always do stuff for you. 

Me: Like what? 

Her: well it's not like you do anything for me! 

Me: Really? What about all the times I've gone out of my way to take you to and from work? All the times that I've sat there listening to you and comforting you when you cried? What about the fact that I bring you lunch every day? Or the time I took you to the hospital and *I* paid for it? All the times I have taken you out to make *you* happy. I'm sorry this is my night and if you are not going to make an effort I don't want you here. 

She gets up to go to the bathroom. I honestly can't believe that I told her all of that I felt so relieved to get it off my chest (haha). She ended up having some guy she knows take her home while me and Jon stayed out until 3-4 in the morning having a blast! At then end of the night he told me ""You're my sister and I am so sorry that you were hurt. If I had known that had happened on your birthday I would have been there in a heartbeat."" 

Now fast forward to this morning. She comes to my work (she never visits me I always visit her) and says that I was right last night. She apologized and said that she should have been focused on me and that she doesn't want to lose me as a friend. I simply told her that actions speak louder than words. 

She's off to work so we'll see what happens I guess! 

I can't thank all of you enough for seriously giving me the cahones to stand up for myself. You all made me come to the conclusion that it would be alright if I was alone for a while which gave me the courage to **finally** speak my mind and tell her how I feel instead of internalizing it. 

Edit for clarity: Jon is ""like a brother"" not my actual brother. When we go anywhere we have always been brother/sister because we look so much alike. Also Jon is not his real name. :) 

**TL;DR Reddit gives me the courage to stand up and tell my shitty best friend how shitty she is to me**



*To all the people who have offered to take me out I really appreciate each and every offer. I will get through this thanks to you guys. Reddit--you rock! I don't feel so alone even though I may have just lost my ""best-shitty"" friend.*

Holly molly! Someone gave me gold! Thank you! But it was thanks to you guys that I even had a chance of standing up for myself. 

**Edit/Update** Not sure if anyone even reads this anymore but I know for a fact that she went out clubbing last night with a girl I despise (and she knows it). I haven't called or texted her at all and I won't until she calls me. I'm going to stay strong and try my best to ignore her.

Lady comes in with her niece and says that the camera they just purchased a few hours ago didn't have a lens cap. Honestly I think they just fucking lost it somehow and they never noticed but whatever, and give it to her. Whatever, it's a 75 cent piece of plastic, no big deal. But then the lady decides she wants to bitch about how ""Oh no it's not the Nikon lens cap. It wouldn't be fair to my niece if she didn't get the Nikon lens cap."" Are you FUCKING serious? Because the cap doesn't have the word ""Nikon"" on it, it's a bad cap and nowhere near good enough for you? GIVE ME A SILVER SHARPIE AND I'LL WRITE IT ON FOR YOU. 

It wouldn't have been so bad had she not acted so self-righteous and holier than thou. What a d-bag.

Then she says that she wants to straight up return the camera (which they had already used for a few hours by this point

I was incredulous. I had to ask twice just to make sure I understood the situation.
""You want to return the camera... for the lens cap?"" 
""Yes.""
""For...... the lens cap that says Nikon...?""
""Yes. Can't you do that?""

Holy fuck. So I get a manager and he tells me to just grab one from a brand new camera give it to them, you're so fucking special aren't you? So we'll bend over backwards just so you can get some silver colored lettering on a piece of plastic. ""The customer is always right!"" Oh yeah sure. The customer can be a complete douchecanoe, but they're always right! 

And as if that's not enough

Oh yeah

Oh and thanks for calling the store afterwards to complain about how you thought that I was accusing you of lying. No

What a obnoxious bitch.

**Edit**: I just woke up and didn't expect so many comments. I forgot to mention that the niece was the one that paid for the camera and was content with the off brand lens cap. I didn't have any issues with her. It was the Aunt that was annoying. At one point she (the Aunt) also complained to me about why they didn't get a lower price on the camera since it was a little cheaper online. I told her if she went to customer service they could process a refund for the difference but she wanted to know why they didn't do it when she was first rung up. Thing is

Anyway after sleeping I feel much more.. placid I suppose. After the incident yesterday I actually cooled off for a while

Anyway, thanks for reading guys. I'll be sure to read the rest of the comments later.

One night I went out with a few mates to celebrate his birthday. Now I live a town with a limited amount of local hotspots. Everyone usually goes to the same place

That's when I spot my girlfriend of 4 years sitting in the bistro with another man. I knew something was up as she said she was staying home tonight (we live together). I'm a very calm man

After about 2 hours they leave in a taxi

We all went back to my place (we had not drank much at all so there were at least 10 sober enough to drive with 8 more able to tag along). Now the lease was in her name so what I was about to do next makes it that much easier. 

We got all my stuff TV, dining table, microwave. Nearly everything that was useful was mine except for a few kitchen appliances and utensils. Loaded everything up in all the boys cars and left taking it back to a friends place with a spare room. Basically I just left without a reason or trace. Also changed my number and email.

A few weeks later I found out through some friends that she still has no idea what happened and was emotionally destroyed. I didn't care at all. Once someone cheats on me they are automatically dead to me

Now you may be asking about if I considered if she would become depressed and commit suicide. I knew she wouldn't I had known her for way too long

I'm a regular redditor who's been looking in on this sub on and off for a while. Thought I'd finally get this off my chest.
As briefly as I can: About 20 years ago, but a nice enough guy.

One day, and not too many folks were out in the heat. The complex pool had a little changing hut that had a little bar area attached. As I was approaching the gate, thought I heard a cry or shout, sounded like a young voice. Opened the gate and shut it behind me, which made a clang. Heard a thump from in the changing room, then the door bursts open and this kid comes running out. He's about 12, wearing a bathing suit. I didn't know him but had seen him around the pool and complex sometimes. He's crying and runs right past me, ""You ok? What's wrong?"" Turn around to see this guy coming out of the changing room. He's also in a bathing suit, twitchy. Walks past me mumbling something like ""It's cool, and didn't want to call the cops if it was just a misunderstanding (and also

Some time goes by, shooting hoops with some other kids. I asked if I could play horse with them and they said sure. So we played a few games. I learned their names and that they all lived in the complex. I told them I'd get some gatorades and then we sat in the shade to cool off. When the kids got up to go play some more, I asked the one kid to sit a minute. Said I didn't know if he remembered, but a few weeks ago I went to the pool and saw him come running out of the changing room crying, and saw (guy's name) come out of the changing room right after. I said, ""(Guy) said he had come into the changing room without knocking and that you were just scared. That what happened?"" He had his head down and didn't say anything for a bit, and then he started crying. Man, guy had shown up, he starts showing him the cards

I sat there with him for a little while and tried to say something useful but didn't really know what to do. I asked if he had told his parents or anyone else and he said no. I said maybe he should and he said it was just him and his older brother and their dad, and also asked me not to tell anyone else.

So I head back to my apartment, and put them near my bed. Then I start spying on the guy. I already know he and his roommate usually stay in nights, and he doesn't have a steady girlfriend. From my front window on the second floor I can see across the compound to his front door on the lower level, so I rearrange our shitty little kitchen table and chairs so I can sit there and look out the window. My roommate asks me what's up one night after like three or four days of me sitting at the table every night with a book or magazine pretending to read, and I tell him I'm trying to not watch so much TV, but I'm basically staring at their front door the whole time.

Six days after my talk with the kid, throw my dark clothes and bat out the bedroom window and then leave. Go around, get my stuff, go to the pool changing room (irony) and change, and then back to the courtyard. Near the parking lot there's a fenced-off area where the dumpsters are. I open the gate, go in and crouch, and leave the gate open a little so I can see. I'm telling myself in my head the whole time, you can't kill him."" He comes back about half an hour later. Gets out of his truck, falls holding his leg. I stick the end of the bat against his neck and say ""If you make one more sound I'll bash your fucking head in."" Then I beat him, arms

About 20 minutes after I get back, talk to his roommie and knock on a few doors asking if anyone saw anything. Apparently the answer is no because they leave after about an hour.

My roommate's all excited talking about it
So next day, couple bruised vertebra, fingers on both hands broken and contusions everywhere else. Will be in hospital for a week and then in a full leg cast for a few months. I ask do they know who it was or what it was about, and he says the roommate has no clue -- guy has no enemies he knows of, and police think it might have been an attempted robbery or carjacking that got out of hand, or maybe just marauding kids.

A week later the guy is home. He spends a couple weeks indoors, he says he's not supposed to drink with the pain meds but fuck it, so we all crack a beer. I look at him a couple times but he doesn't seem anxious about me or wary, just in some pain. His roommate starts talking about how the police are useless, they have no idea who did it and probably never will, so forth. The guy doesn't say much, just that he's happy the mf didn't beat his ass to death. So we leave. I moved out a couple months later to go back to school and never saw or heard from the guy again or had any contact about it from police. I assumed at the time and still do that HE assumed that the boy's father was the one who beat him

1370477649.0,1fra92,You weren't there.,NavyGuysKid,595,75,76,"Hi mom.  

So after years of no contact

You weren’t there that Friday afternoon.  When I got home from school and found that all of your and my sister’s stuff was gone.  With Dad on assignment and Brother staying with friends.  I realized fairly quickly that it was punishment.  Because I refused to lie and say Dad or Brother was abusing me.  Because I told my sister it was wrong to say she would.  And because I told Dad (and my teacher and the MPs and everyone else who asked) who gave me the bruise on my face and why.  You weren’t there that Friday night when I finally fell asleep on the sofa.  You weren’t there Saturday.  Or Sunday

You weren’t there for the following weeks when I was left with strangers.  When I was labeled as ‘abandoned’.  When Dad was finally able to push through the adoption papers that had thankfully already been in progress.  You didn’t come to court for the hearing to finalize the adoption.  You didn’t come to court for the hearing to end your parental rights, and grateful I still am that he made such a wonderful decision.  Did you ever wonder?  Would the court give custody of a tween age girl to a single Military Dad?  Did you care that I could have ended up in foster?

You weren’t there when we found out that what I was suffering from was not regular aches and pains but something more serious.  You never responded to our requests for family medical history when the doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong.  I still don’t know if I inherited this or if it was just a twist of fate.  You weren’t there when I realized that every plan I had for my future

You weren’t there when we transferred twice in two years.  New schools

You weren’t there when I got asked on my first date.  You weren’t there to see Dad and Brother scare the boy so bad that he barely spoke to me that night.  You weren’t there when I got asked to my first formal dance.  You weren’t there to see Dad’s face when I came out in my first formal dress.   You weren’t there when that boy said he didn’t like me anymore and I cried for days.

You weren’t there when I learned how to drive.  You weren’t there when I got my license and when Dad bought me that used Jeep.  You weren’t there to hear me squeal so high that Brother still claims I ruptured his eardrum.

You weren’t there.  You never called.  You never wrote, right?  Even though you never asked how I am, what I was doing.  You never told us how my sister was or where.  Never even told us where you were.  Just a demand for an invitation because you deserve to be there when I graduate high school.

When I graduate high school?  Bitch that was LAST YEAR.  I just finished my first year of college.  
You weren’t there.

Proud to call myself

Neither my mom nor grandma could handle staying with him, scratching in his favorite spot under his chin and stroking his head while they dosed him. He purred, stretched out his front paws and kneaded the sleeve of my hoodie as he gradually fell asleep.

As we stood in the lobby filling out the last of the paperwork, the wife broke down in sobs and the husband shook his head in resignation. The whole lobby was deathly quiet as we shared in this family's pain.

Then, and said ""We'd like to help them. How much can we pay to get their dog triaged and start its treatment?"". And then, the guy got out his credit card and paid to help save this family's dog. The young woman put her arm around the dog's sobbing owner and comforted her.

I kept my area clean, or less coal ripped from the earth to supply a power plant. Plus wood is an entirely renewable resource. It just takes time.

UPDATE: I had so many responses but I'm on my cell phone so here goes:

My dad was stationed at an army base in my hometown. He was taking some mechanical classes for the national guard. He caught a cab after partying late and shared it with his victim. She was intoxicated and he was on drugs
I used to visit my dad in jail once or twice a year since birth with my psychotic and abusive paternal grandmother. The last time (at 12) he made sexual comments on the phone to me and I refused to see him the next day. I hadn't known why he was in jail until my 20s all I knew was that he's a pervert. In my 20s my mother and maternal grandmother talked about it all and I found out why he was in there and she showed me cards and things sent to her home for my mother and I. Some were benign and sad, he can only pretend to have emotions like empathy and guilt. He is not sorry for what he's done, he's more focused on what he's lost, how people portray him, he considers himself a victim. They had started an email program for inmates in my 20s and my rant and rage email was after seeing the cards and finding out the truth. It sounds weird but part of me wants to find the victims family, to give them the apology they'll never receive from him. I want to tell them that he won't have his daughter either. Its weird, I know. Also, no address, a big Bordeaux (like a mastiff) and a big strong husband... Who knows absolutely none of this. Not my new name

I simply explain what their options are and how they may procure what is necessary for the method they decide upon. Only about half of my clients make the decision to exit.

1373467626.0,1i0czn,I failed to save a drowning man.,lady_raini,542,70,103,"Ive told very few people about this story


During the summer of 2004


My big sister, and the swimming area was pretty empty. The only other people there was a small family. A man, his wife, their two children, and the wife's sister. The man and his sister in-law were in the water, and the wife and kids were sitting on the bank.


About half an hour later I hear yelling, so I just went back to enjoying my own swim. A few moments later the yelling turned to screams, and the splashing got wilder. My sister asked me i thought they needed help, but I said I think they are still playing around. So we watched them, and then the sister in-law came running out of the water screaming, and I realized this was serious.


Since we had my young nephew, and I wasn't even sure if I was in the right spot. I kept coming up for air and looking to the family for help, but they were screaming frantically in Spanish, and I couldn't understand them. (I found out later that none of them knew how to swim, and that's why they couldn't help me.) So I just kept diving. Each time I dove down to find nothing but cloudy water, I would come back up feeling more frantic. I started to realize that I was running out of time. 


At that moment four men come running towards the water, and I will never forget their response. They said ""We have our clothes, and shoes on."" I couldn't understand why this mattered. I still don't. Take your fucking shoes off, and help me! What the fuck?


Another minute passes, and he told me there was nothing more I could do, and to get out of the water now.


As I walked limply out of the water, and I had failed her. I had failed to save her husband as he drowned right in front of her.


I walked past her to where my sister sat with her son, and the old woman touched my arm and squeezed. She started praying, and all I could do was stare wide eyed at these innocent, and oblivious children. They were both younger than five, and clueless of what had just happened. I didn't cry. I just stared.


Once the emergency vehicles arrived, and I didn't stop for hours. My sister had family come over to be with us, and I remember them offering me a Xanax to calm me down. I took it, and was able to eventually stop crying, and fall asleep.


I will never forgot that day. I will never forget the screams I heard from the man's wife. The sight of her crumpled on her knees will never leave my mind. I wonder sometimes how she is now, and to tell her how sorry I am that I couldn't find him. I wanted so desperately to help them, and I still feel the guilt of failing. If I just hadn't hesitated when I first heard the screams, maybe I would have found him in time. I know what ifs are pointless, but I can't help it. 


Everyone told me that it was for the best that I didn't reach him. They said that he would have just pulled me under with him since I wasn't a very strong swimmer, and not tried to help. His life mattered just as much as my own, perhaps even more since he was a parent, and I was not at that time. Self preservation was that last thing on my mind in that moment. Doing all I could to save him was all that mattered. But I failed. I didn't save him. And his children lost their father before they were even old enough to understand what that means.


August 4


**Edit**: I just want to say thank you for all of the comforting, but I might just do so. I've been through, and have seen a lot in my life, and I think counseling would be a big help. Just talking about it here has relieved some of the weight of it.


I do not consider myself a hero though. Not because I failed to save this man, well I can only imagine that they must have felt overwhelmed, and unprepared for walking into that situation. Maybe they were able to realize it was a loss before I was able to. I just felt that if there was a tiny chance that he could be revived then why not try to find him and do so.

I had an early life which worked against me to make having an intimate relationship with another person difficult to impossible.

I gradually made peace with having no family or friends of note and being doomed to virginity forever.

1368541784.0,1ebd5s,"Observations from an old man who is new to reddit (NSFW) (not safe for work, not safe for wimps)",OldePhart,1170,729,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ebd5s/observations_from_an_old_man_who_is_new_to_reddit/, especially and particularly when observing the day-to-day interactions of social sites such as this.

Only having been here for a few days, I am certain that over time, some of these conclusions will bear out to be in error. Newsflash: That's how life works, and I'm OK with it.

Observation number one: There are WAY too many people in these ( forums, whateverthefuck you want to call them ) that assign entirely too much importance to how many 'votes' they get. 

I haven't seen such retarded clique-ness as this since grade school. Who gives a hairy monkey's ass how many tools vote your post up or down?  Are you running for some sorta populist political office? Speak your REAL mind and let the damned chips fall where they may. Piss on popularity. The crowd you are so keen to run with will turn on you and eat your ass before you can form a lucid thought about it. To hell with them.


Observation number two: Holy FUCK, zombified Stepford Children are we putting in colleges these days? I've heard more original thoughts in a parrot farm. Again, it seems as if there is some sorta Zerg hive-mind at work here.  If my tinfoil wasn't so tight, I'd swear someone managed to incarnate Kerrigan and she has a shit ton of you under her spell.

Get some original thoughts into your addled heads and question the shit they are spoon feeding you in these indoctrination mills. I think of all the progress that was made in the sixties to get out from under the brainwashing and it fills me with sorrow to see it all gone to waste.


Observation number three. Political Correctness has run the fuck amok. Everyone is so fucking terrified of speaking their mind and possibly ""offending"" someone that no real dialogue can take place.

Grow some fucking balls, no less. If you wanna be a fag, fine, be a happy cocksucker, but don't get your pubes in a twist just because someone acknowledged the fact that you are a fag. Same with the carpet munchers and trans-testicles.  If you weigh more than you really ought, YOU ARE FAT! Deal with it, ffs. If you can't see, either. These games of semantics have been going on forever. 'Victims' will always find a way to be offended


I think that's enough for now

I literally was just walking to my car after getting a coffee... just living my life as usual. I was kind of sleepy after a casual meeting at work. Did I look at you the wrong way? So sorry I offended you

You ruined my day with your rude ignorant rant. You gave me anxiety now I wake up having anxiety attacks. Do you think assaulting an incredibly small female 1/3rd your size and following her makes you an example for man and woman kind? If I hadn't threatened to call the police would you have assaulted me? You certainly looked like you were going to try. You were marching towards me with such rage... what did I do to you? Do you feel better knowing I won't feel safe walking alone again for a very long time? That I'll triple check my locks? That I'll live in fear of every day things until I recover from your undeserved rage? How does it make you feel that as a petite female I already know I'm vulnerable and you just added 30 extra reasons for me to panic all time. 

And not to stereotype myself one way or another I was dress in a cream lace maxi dress and an adorable floppy hat. I might as well have been going to church. That doesn't really scream terrorist on sight to me...

You know what pisses me off the most is I probably hate extremist Muslims more than you. I'd line them up and punch them all in the mouth if I could. Their thinking is just so polluted with ideas of a religion they have turned on its head to perpetuate their stupid and ignorant ideas and to oppress people. Don't even get me started on those extremists that use the religion to oppress women. The evil things I want to do to them... 

Anyway Sir I got distracted thinking about religion and extremist and gender and all that good stuff. I want to let you know I don't hate you

You made me feel like I did something wrong for just *existing* and that's the most unfair part. 

You should be ashamed of yourself and you know... although I didn't get a chance to say anything to you other than I was calling the police I wish I had told you the next time you yell at someone or pick a fight at least pick on someone your own size you jerk! You had at least a foot or a bit more on me and outweighed me by at least 100 pounds. What the hell is anyone supposed to do in that situation anyway? You could have kicked my ass and you probably could have killed me with fairly minimal effort. I hope that makes you feel good about yourself.

I hope this anxiety fades fast so I can move on with my life. I hope I succeed in doing all the incredible things I have set out to do in my life and you remain a disgusting blemish on otherwise generally wonderful humanity. I'm hoping someone snuffs out your ignorance with some enlightening knowledge

1369719068.0,1f6mvk,"Girls dislike you not because they go for jerks and you're a nice guy, they dislike you because you're a needy, under confident loser who thinks that there is nothing more to dating other than being nice and chasing her 24/7.",iHeartCapitalism,660,163, to me and a lot of men is as common sense as water is wet. But some seem to be clueless about this.
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
 
Women don't like jerks. They don't like a man who slaps them (some enjoy it during sex though). They don't want a man who cheats on them and treats them like shit. 
 
 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 

 They want a man that they feel they have to win over. And sadly, lazy, etc.). 
 
 
 
 &amp;nbsp;
 
 
 If you're a nice guy who always goes after her, always show her that you're there for her and you'll wait for her. You'll come off as clingy and insecure. 
 

 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 
 Maybe women have a sense for this thing, it's not that which hurts you. It's not the fact that you're ""nice"" that hurts you, it's the fact that from 200m she can smell your lack of confidence. She knows you don't know how to make a woman want you. She knows that you're like a dog who is happy at every bone thrown at him. 
 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 

 By treating dating a bit like a strategy game. By messaging her, she will love it. She wants to chase you. 
 
 
If you think that just being a nice and caring guy is enough, of course, just never overdo it. 

 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 

And when she does chase you, then she knows she has you.
 
 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 

 
&amp;nbsp; 

 
4 things.
 
 **1st**: I have no problem with women even though I'm short (170cm). But my car doesn't even have a roof
 I have no problems with dating. Women are easy to talk to, but not all, then I must be doing something right. Women are just as easy as men. We're all humans, we're all ""easy"" if we are treated correctly unless if we're **really** not interested.
 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 
 
 
 **2nd**: Second, she may push him off.
 
 
 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 

 
 **3rd**: If she doesn't chase you
 


 &amp;nbsp; 
 

 
 **4th**: Tell me that I'm wrong. Tell me that I'm an idiot, that i'm wrong, that I'm sexist. What do I care? I'm right. If you make a woman want you, don't give her the impression that she has you around her finger. 


 
 &amp;nbsp; 
 
 
Chase her (or him)
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
  

 
**Call me a sexist idiot who see women as a piece of meat
 
 
I love women. I have a thing where I'm very weak for beauty and nothing is more beautiful than a woman (a Mercedes Benz comes close). I treat them with complete respect and never want just a one night stand. I simply came to the realization many years ago
 

 &amp;nbsp; 
  
&amp;nbsp; 
 
 
**tl;dr: Read the whole damn thing**
 
 Edit: This is not THE truth and it's not black and white. This is much like learning how to hit a nail with a hammer, it will turn out Ok, but there are those times where it simply won't work and you'll miss and hit your finger instead.

1365594545.0,1c22jm,Fucking Stereotypes. Fucking. Stereotypes.,ktthecosmicnerd,550,143,345,"Alright. I just had a days-long argument about the true meaning of feminism. I just read a horribly sad post about a young man who can't make friends because he's not ""masculine"" enough. 

First of all, please tell them that they are taking a giant shit on the whole movement. I can tell you that I could give no fewer shits about being sexy, so I don't need some crazy feminista telling me that makeup ads harm my emotional well-being, or that men are oppressing me, or that men checking me out equates to marginalization. Firstly, as a young woman whose confidence originates from intellect and ability, the very idea of being that weak and stupid is insulting. Secondly, we're not any more vulnerable than men are until someone(like society or a crazy feminista) convinces us otherwise. 

The point is

Please recognize the bombastic rhetoric for what it is: pure

Going further with the man love, domineering douchebags who don't acknowledge anything on a higher level than beer, tits, and video games. And the ones that show even a shred of sensitivity or emotional intellect might as well be raw meat in a piranha tank. We school our young men to be protectors and providers, and a lot fit right in, but a lot don't. We hear all these things about the sexual objectification of women, the social pressure to be sexy, and those things are real, while they stay fairly level for women. The theory is that men suffer more because society heaps SO MUCH PRESSURE on them to succeed. But you know what? I didn't hear than on the news. I learned that in a college-level sociology class. Why is it that the cultural issues that harm women are so heavily publicized

It would be nice if someone would speak out against the exploitation of men in a way that doesn't use the phrase ""gold-digging whores."" It would also be nice if someone would speak out against the marginalization of women without pointing the finger solely at men. We're all responsible for our culture.

When I think of the word ""feminism"" my definition goes beyond the issues that women face. My definition encompasses any person, or something in between, who is sensitive and vulnerable and becomes marginalized because of it.

**EDIT:** This post is not in any way meant to degrade womens' rights. Women do face real obstacles. What I say when I say that rape culture/war on women/oppression comes from a very, but they are being communicated incorrectly.

*   I can't walk down the stairs, walk fast or jump without them bouncing around so much that it HURTS. 

*  Clothes don't fit me since they're first made for models who are basically all flat. Want a cute sun dress? Sorry

*  Finding a cute and fun bra is nearly impossible

* My nipples are huge. And I'm talking 5-6 cm in diameter. Plus

* You know that wonderful feeling when you finally get som air underneath them to cool down the sweat? No? Well I only feel that wonderful breeze when I'm barely fitting them into my hands trying to push them up a little.
 
* I have a higher rate of getting breast cancer
 
* I will have to deal with people in my workplace telling me that I'm dressing inappropriately even though I show no clevage at all.
 
* Men (and women) glare and stare. I feel guilty for having bouncing boobs that men look at when being around other women. And I get sad when I feel like I have to cover myself so that other women won't be mad and to prevent sexual harrassment.
 
* Natural big boobs are not firm

* You can enlarge yours as much as you want
 
* Want to hang out not wearing a bra? sorry

* I have constant neck and shoulderpains. It doesn't matter how much or often I get a massage

* They make my already small head look tiny.
 
* And I feel so guilty for wanting to make them smaller because everyone tells me they're great and I should be happy about them.

The only good thing about them is that it's considerd ""sexy"" with large boobs. And that doesn't really cut it. I envy all of you A-B cups out there

On my second stint at university, but dick size is what killed it. I somehow managed to make them not notice my height or my hair(though I did have more hair then), but they could not look past my penis size.

As time goes on

Even if I did get a girl to be interested and make her ignore my height or hair loss or even penis size

I read on /r/sex about some girls saying that sexual technique is very important. But I got nothing. I am almost thinking of hiring a very expensive $1k/ hour escort.

Some things you need to know before you read on... My mother is an alcoholic

It was as if it was just yesterday when Michelle and I met. It was our first day in Kindergarten, so I didn't really have too many friends throughout school. Michelle was my one and only true friend. My best friend. We did everything together... All throughout elementary school. Whenever we were put into different classes Michelle would beg her parents to put her into my class.

I think it was around the seventh grade was when I realized that I loved this girl... So... I confessed my love for her. And luckily for me

And then it happened. Her father had received a job offer that had to make them move far away from me... I could not have been any more devastated. Michelle was pretty broken up about it as well... but we both knew that her father had to take the job.

We kept in touch through MSN messenger (yes, how are you?' 'good, thanks, and you?' 'I'm fine.' And as even more time went by it was a weekly thing... Then eventually it stopped.

I became very depressed because I was always there waiting for her, best friend, and my only friend.

Things became really heated between myself and my mother during this. It has always been bad because of her drinking, at the age of 17, I was kicked out of my house. I ended up roaming the streets with no money for a couple of days until a man came up to me and offered me lunch. He talked to me, asked me a few questions, etc etc. And then he called the government about me being a homeless 17 year old. I ended up being put in a foster home after that. It wasn't the greatest home, but at least I was in a shelter of some sort with food. This was when I decided that I needed a job. So I went around applying everywhere, and I was hired by McDonald's.

Still, but I still tried. Balancing work, with school and my depression wasn't that easy. I ended up just barely graduating last year.

Now... I don't know about everywhere else in the world, can you guess? To the city that Michelle had moved to.

I ended up going to a library in the new city the first day I arrived and checked my e-mail, and had a lot of explaining to do, and is in her city now.

We ended up meeting up soon afterwards and I told her everything. Everything that has happened to me. She told me that the reason why she wasn't able to talk to me as much was because of the school

After that night

Fast forward to three days ago... Michelle was supposed to spend the evening with me because I had my day off from work. Michelle had her classes in the morning, but there was no response. It was around 7PM when I had this gut wrenching feeling that something was terribly wrong. I called her cell phone, but nobody picked up. By now my heart was racing, and that knot in my stomach grew bigger. I tried once more, and somebody picked up and asked who I was. I told them that I was Michelle's boyfriend. It was then and there that I learned that Michelle was hit by a drunk driver on her way to see me, and was in critical condition in the hospital... I couldn't believe this. I couldn't keep my composure. I literally had a breakdown. I called her parents and told them of what happened, and then I rushed to the hospital. I screamed at everyone asking where Michelle was. I needed to see her. I wanted to see her. I had to see her. But I was told that I couldn't. That she was in the ER, and her father did basically the same thing I did. Her mother was just in tears

Almost two hours had passed

The news hit me so hard that I didn't even know how to react. Her mother bursted into tears

Michelle wasn't just the love of my life. She was my best friend, and my everything is now gone.

It's been three days since this has happened. Three long

I love you

I was a college student. A typical one. Drinking, laughing, etc. I enjoyed that time both by myself, and with Kris. Kris was in a relationship with a girl that I didn't particularly care for, mainly because she treated him like dogshit, and I knew that he was a much better person than that. He and she had that annoying relationship, where they would breakup, breakup again. Annoying. The last time they broke up

He and I had a minor falling out. By that, it was better to fight it out, then get over it. That's what we did. Fought each other in his front yard with his mother, and the most wonderful woman I know ""Gloria"", watched us. When we were done (he won), she bandaged us up, gave us ice for the bruises and bumps

Three weeks later, both because of my betrayal, as well as hers. I thought we were fine, but we obviously had issues that he internalized. A few nights later (Jan 16), I got a phone call from him. I answered as I normally do, ""What's up, bitch?"" and he responded

Five minutes later (a normal 15 minute drive), hauling ass up the stairs to his bedroom. His voice ... something was horribly wrong.

I turned his doorknob, and pulled the trigger. The back of his head exploded. A pink mist clouded the air, and bone fragments and brain matter exploded on the ceiling, wall, and the carpet behind him. His body crumpled. Boneless. My brother shot himself in front of me. Gloria screamed out his name from downstairs, hysteria already in her voice as she jetted up the stairs towards the door. I couldn't let my mother see my brother's body. I slammed the door shut, locked it, he shit and pissed himself. I left it there, all while emptying my stomach completely into his trashcan. The police and ambulance arrived, it was found that I did not kill him

I have yet to see his tombstone. I haven't spoken to my brother in almost 7 years. In six days

If you knew that

I remember being woken up by the smell of coffee every morning before school, and you'd sip it slowly and close your eyes and smile, basking in the taste and smell. In the summertime, you'd make your own iced coffee and comment how it was so much cheaper than buying a cup at the drive-through.

I always associated coffee with you. You'd drink it in the morning to start your day. You'd go to a friend's house 'just for a quick cup of coffee' and you'd stay there talking for hours, with a child's impatience.

When you were getting sicker, pleading with you to just accept my offer, thinking that smelling the familiar aroma and watching you enjoy a cup of brew would make everything normal. Just one cup, Mom. Maybe that's why you're so tired today... just a sip.

Now? Now I realize that cancer will take everything from you, strength, coherence, independence, and ultimately your life. You were 57. You had many years left to savor cups of coffee in the morning. 
I was 19. I had many years ahead of me to buy you a cup at Dunkin Donuts and sip it with you out on the porch.

Cancer is an evil, intelligent, independent, caring mother. 

I'll never forgive myself for going back to school to finish my finals while you were deteriorating in the hospital. I'll never forgive myself for giving the nurses the OK to give you more morphine even though you didn't want it, because this likely made you sad and I just wanted you to be happy and okay. I'll never forgive myself for watching you lay there in your nursing home bed and just HOPING that tonight would be the night that you would finally pass away, because I couldn't deal with it anymore. I'll never forgive myself for being depressed every morning I woke up and you were still alive, because it was another day that I had to watch you get even worse. 
I'll never forgive myself. I carry this every day. I smell it in every whiff of coffee.

Now that you're gone, to let you know that I'm about to graduate college and lead a successful life, and that I miss you and I love you so much, and I can't thank you enough for being my mother and doing all that you did for me, and that even though I feel lost and empty just about 100% of the time, I'm pushing through it all because you'd want me to.

You're not better than everyone else because you play D&amp;D, understanding the watered-down, generalized concepts behind a scientific theory is often *much* easier than understanding the math behind it (that you've probably never even looked at). You've never written or peer-reviewed a scientific paper. I don't see you ever formulating scientific theories or testing hypothesis. You may know more math than me, or gotten better grades, but I never see you doing anything other than using your college issued pieces of paper as a way to feel superior. Hey, why don't you shut the fuck up, and use your intelligence to actually do something? You unimaginative

You're not better than a goddamned Twilight fan for pretending to like H.P. Lovecraft, and the table-top game of The Call of Cthulhu, to my knowledge, is quite different from his works, and the themes behind them. Besides which, there are other good horror writers, some of which you might enjoy if you ever picked up books other than just nerd-culture approved schlock like ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" book adaptations, and ""Ready Player One"". 

You're not cool because you like to insult art majors. Some work to live, just because you consider yourself an intellectual doesn't make you one. Your philosophy isn't good, it's actually really terrible. While I consider myself a scientific realist, I can recognize that anti-realists can form very compelling arguments. Not that you'd ever know them, because with a name like ""scientific anti-realist"", the dogma-alarm is raised, and you either get super defensive and argue with fallacies, because you clearly know everything

What gets me the most is the hypocricy. You're quick to jump in and point out how some jock is an idiot who is full of himself, but you then see absolutely nothing wrong with spending hours upon hours on a table-top RPG or some new video game I don't give a fuck about. You tout that people are more than labels, yet paradoxically uphold that nerds are ""awesome"", and that they're the ""chosen race"".

My dad's been a raging alcoholic for my whole life. To me, never seriously but he would push her to the ground, grab her and pin her against the wall, etc. 

So, at least since I had moved out at 18, but according to my sister he would still treat her and my mom like he always did.

On the Super Bowl, and when he's in a bad mood, he likes to take it out on my mom. It started out as him just insulting her, that sort of thing. Everyone just tried to get him to relax, to no avail. After about an hour I hear my sister say ""Don't touch her!"" and I go into the living room to see my dad pinning my mom against the wall by her throat.

I was always afraid of my dad because of how mean he is, but after 26 years I knew it was time to do something. I grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around and told him to stop right the fuck now, and he grabbed me by my collar and started shoving me. I shoved back and he headbutted me in the mouth, and I lost my shit. I headbutted him back, and broke his nose bad, split it open. He looked stunned that I would do that, so I hit him 4 or 5 more times in the face until my cousin broke us up.

My uncles shoved my dad outside, right into a picture frame that broke and cut her. When he reached me I threw him to the ground, got on top of him, and hit him until his face was bloody and he was begging me to stop. After I stopped he grabbed me by the collar and screamed, ""Just kill me! Just fucking kill me!"" and the image of him bloody and beaten on the ground, screaming that at me still makes my stomach churn.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes

I hardly even know where to start with this

When I was younger, and seen, all sorts of terrible shit happening to kids. Well, even through rigorous  interviews and background checks a few nasties still appeared. One of them would steal from our piggy banks, another fell asleep on the job all the time and we'd go hungry and another would scream at us for requesting the food our mum left for us because she didn't want to prepare it as she was a vegetarian. 
    
There were so many I can't picture their faces - just young, with no concept of clue of sex and she forced me. You hardly ever hear of female rapists. Rarer still are females who prey on little girls. I had no idea what to do - your parents would warn you not to talk to strangers, or about ""bad men"" - what about women who were meant to look after you? 
   
She allowed her boyfriend to abuse me - at least I think it was her boyfriend. It really could have been anyone,I remember this very clearly, pull out any wobbly baby teeth.

She looked at me and apologized


We ended hanging out most days in the following week, I was just a failed musician (bassist) and computer nerd that had only ever had failed relationships.  She was different from the other women I had dated.  She was gorgeous, intelligent, had the same taste in music as me, and had the same dark sense of humor I had.

I often wondered what would have happened had I not gone to the concert, or had not bought that beer.


I was planning on proposing to her

I think it's BS when you say you don't like something after trying it once, but I still try it sometimes, and guess what? I **love** kalua pork. It's awesome. Thank goodness I gave kalua pork a chance, because I really like it. When I was growing up I didn't like shrimp. Now I love shrimp; it's just the way my mom prepared it when I was a kid that I didn't like.

When I got married we tried all sorts of things, do some finger play, douche if need be, etc etc etc. My wife and I have tried it probably a dozen times over the last 5 years. And we haven't liked it, neither of us, not once.

After the first time I thought, and then we tried again with my newfound advice and ideas as to where things might have gone wrong. Still, I didn't like it. For me, it doesn't feel nearly as good as vaginal intercourse (probably because my wife is tight! tight! tight! as Tuco would say); for her, it didn't even feel sexual really. 

But after about a dozen tries at various times, and don't care to continue trying. It's not like there's anything missing in our sex life; to the contrary, I've been blessed with a wife who has no trouble climaxing both vaginally and clitorally, and of course I enjoy every bit of it. So I guess it was just curiousity, more than anything, that made us keep trying. But now we've stopped and I'm fine with that.

What bothers me, you're doing it wrong. And if you're not doing anal sex, you're missing out. The fact that this mentality gets upvoted at all really annoys me. So much so, apparently, that I feel the need to get it off my chest.

I shrank into my chair. I didn't know what to say. I wanted to let her have it. My look gave it away. ""You're...not Jewish are you?"" To most people here in Hong Kong

I'm devastated. I really liked her. I had been looking forward to our date for over a month. I've been through a long string of rejections this past year, or my personality, but I've never been so hurt over something I just can't control. I feel utterly worthless right now.

~~I'm reminded how most of the world hates me just because I am a Jew, have explicitly told me *they like* Jews because of our many cultural similarities. I did some research and found that historically, China was one of the most tolerant to the Jews.

I never said anything to my dad about his brother sucking me off in my own bed.  I eventually forgave him and it was never spoken of again.

I've been an overworked IT guy for four years

I have four bosses. If I'm meant to be on one site, but everyone has an excuse not to. I could be up to my elbows changing drums and belts and get yelled at for not answering a call and 'owning the call'. In real terms this means I'd be working on a misbehaving press with an urgent job on it that absolutely must go out that afternoon with an angry print op, and angry customers demanding their jobs, and I'm being forced to take some fucking schoolkid's poster project order and explain the difference between coated and uncoated paper in a twenty minute call I must own. I'm expected to know pricing. I'm expected to be an impromptu sales rep.

I've been away sick two days in my entire employment. Because I'm single I was told in no uncertain terms was I to take holidays any time parents wanted to take holidays at the same time. I took three days off in 2010 and returned to a business in utter disarray. Nobody around me can problem solve.

Almost a month ago, who didn't accept my original quit date as she'd seen no evidence I'd quit. That's bullshit, I ran their fucking email. So I stated again and said I quit, and handed her my letter. OK, an extra week's notice, I can handle that.

The next closest boss to me panics after a week and realises just what he's losing and begs me to stay. I tell him I need things to change. I need an offsider

So I came to my last day (Yesterday) with no evidence anything was changing. It's in the pipeline, without trying to do a single fifteen minute task and finding I'm being interrupted by customer calls, meeting requests, or getting a fucking book from a shelf in a manager's office 40 minutes away just to hand it to a staff member who works IN THE SAME DAMNED ROOM. I'm promised it'll all come.

11am and one of the other bosses tells me I'm needed on another site as their receptionist is off sick. Their. Fucking. Receptionist. We have sixty something employees and... Just no.

I said no

So I reminded my boss where my documentation was kept for my replacement

at 11:15AM I walked to the cafe across the road

I have enough savings to carry me for almost a year if I did nothing else about work. I think I'll take a couple weeks off and enjoy waking up after the sun rises.

I've had four calls tonight from work, I got home and relaxed so thoroughly I had the biggest dump in months, and that's normally a morning thing for me. Purging or some shit? Yeah. I feel so damned relieved.

**TL;DR I did all IT for my employer and had stupid interruptions taking up 85% of my time. I quit

**Edit: Wow! What a response, yeah that was the point. My disappointment was as much with myself.

Or it was. Friday morning I got up later than normal but still got to see the sun rise. around ten I drove for a surprise visit to my sister's family. It was great to reconnect. Her husband has a couple of work leads I can follow up. Got back saturday night and spent today taking photos. This is great.

I didn't transcribe the calls (sorry guys, and one of the good kind people. He could do it and I could have told him where to start, but then it'd never end for him. Instead I said I can only be contacted by boss 2 (more about him coming up) about doing any work for them - but reminded him of our conversations about being expected to work more and more. He got the idea, and I pointed him to the guys we actually have a service contract with for those machines. Of course, they cost more...

Boss 2 I call ""Doctor So"" in my head. He's probably the most painful and inept guy I've dealt with in management. He phoned more times than I could count, been there long enough to know).

He tells me straight up ""Employees don't get to set their pay

That's his way of ending a sentence and letting people under him fill in their own presumption about what to do next, So..."" and ""You're not being fair, so..."" and ""This isn't what we'd worked out, so..."" (we hadn't worked ANYTHING out whatsover). I couldn't really respond any more, but after I ended the call I wished I'd said ""Well I'm just not working for you any more, so...""

Last call was from fourth boss, but I cleared that up. We had a chat about how shit it was there, and if she's telling the truth a lot of it comes from the owners. They're her family and she feels stuck in her job working for them too.

A little kindness goes a long way with me even if it's far too late for me to come back, and what I thought needed to change ASAP. I wished her well too. Feels like I tied ends up a little less burnt-bridge style than three days ago.**",,False,,t5_2ranw,1373175158.0,,

I'm 100% convinced that they can only live this way because they are all very well off. All of them live in very large houses and drive very nice cars, rice, pasta, and potatoes for nearly every meal.

I'm sick of being effectively told that if you aren't rich enough to afford an all organic, then you are a filthy person who is eating yourself straight into a grave.

After a month or so, we had a few mutual friends and I talked to her and it quickly escalated from us being distant acquaintances to friends to close friends and eventually best friends by the end of the school semester. In that time, but myself as well. I remember around 5 months in I was laying on my bed and texting her and I realized that she was something special. I personally don't believe in soul mates but it just felt so different this time. Her and I shared the same sense of humour and she was absolutely hilarious. I loved making her laugh and tried to do it as often as I could just cause I loved see her smile. She made me such a better person and when I was with her it felt like as if all my problems in the world were gone. It seemed that time was endless and I just felt so complete. Of course I also realized that love is a two-way street and I accepted it. I accepted that she might not like me back and I would have to be content with being nothing more than her friend my whole life.

He threatens to call my manager, he isn't, first time customer) and demands a refund because the person that bought the pizza isn't there (or existed in the first place.) So his wife, girlfriend, sister, I don't know walks out and offers to pay for the pizza with a 100 dollar bill which I don't have change for so I take the money and said I will go to the store (which is like a 2 minute drive away) and come back with change. She says okay that's fine, but can we have the pizza first? I was VERY suspicious of the 100 dollar bill, so I told her no she can't BUT what I can do is give you the receipt which ENTITLES her to the pizza so I HAVE to come back, now give me my fucking pizza before its cold"" and then

So he gets pissed off again, grabs me, and rips the money out of my hand and the receipt. Tells me to fuck off and shove the pizza up my ass, which by the way sounds really uncomfortable.

It's been three years since my high school sweetheart committed suicide by hanging himself at UW-Madison.  He broke up with me a few months before (I assume as an attempt to ""save me"" from the emotional carnage) and had happily moved on to a thinner

I didn't have time to grieve. 

Only six months later my then current boyfriend was killed in a car accident that I was also involved in.  We were moving in together. We were just driving to Target to get some clothes hangers. 

It wasn't fucking fair. I was 20 years old and two people who I loved to death were

People expected me to move on. After all

When I didn't people thought I was being selfish. My mother made me move out and go back to college

I tried drugs, grief groups, everything. I was terrified of getting over it. I was terrified of putting a punctuation mark in my story with them.  I denied that it was over.  I still, three years later, have dreams that they are alive and I see them and run to them and touch their face and tell them I love them.

At this point I can't hold down a job.  Even without these two major deaths I am still recovering from a childhood of physical and sexual abuse from my father and a mother who thought it was best to play the trophy and keep out of it.  I barely eat, I cry when I think about the prospect of sleeping, I can't even be the passenger in a car without bursting into tears.

My only happiness is my little rescue dog, grooming, dog park, and various parks and recreational activities I would have laid down next to their graves and died.  But now I can barely even afford to keep him.  Student loans take up all of the money I have and I will probably be moving at the end of the month, maybe into some kind of projects or government assisted housing.

I'm scared. I'm alone. Seamus is sleeping on the other side of the bed and has no idea. I'd kill myself before I had to give him up but even the prospect of dying and leaving him alone is too much for me.

We always lived in the same town. I went to the same lower-class public school for 18 years. I graduated valedictorian in a class of only 35 other students. I was bullied as a kid because I wanted to go to college and make something of myself. It was my way out.
But college took money; money my parents didn't have. I broke their hearts knowing they couldn't send any of their kids to college (I'm the oldest of 3). So I worked. 

My first job was at a poor dog shelter. I worked there for $5/hr feeding dogs, but worked through it. I got heat stroke once. On my days off, I'd take free college-level classes at the local community college. I got laid off.
My next job was at some horse stables. I again cleaned up shit for less than min wage and worked more hours than I'd be paid. I was sick for a month during this job
My last job was this past summer. I worked at a lumber yard
All in all, sweat, and yes, vomit."" 
Then I get to the University of Illinois. I join the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps to cover my tuition. My parents were so proud and so was I. I still am. I would be the first of my family to get a college education from start to finish without interruption in decades.
Then I tell a few guys this on the first week of classes. I tell them where I'm from and how I don't have much money. I tell them my ACT scores, etc. We were all sharing. They just laughed in my face and asked how I even got into this school.

Through grade school she had a couple friends but they've always seemed to move or they were just kinda fleeting.  But she had a best friend, Allison kinda drifted apart.  I think going into middle school really showed Mandy how different Allison is since she's autistic.  They still said hi in the halls and sometimes partnered in classes, and walked home together after school.  But most of the time Allison was alone at school.  It was hard work trying to appear normal and keep up, even with the help of an IEP.   
This year, Allison blossomed this year.  They hung out and it was SO normal.  I felt so good, so proud of my daughter for the strides she made. 
Well, Haley, have completely shut my daughter out.  The two of them have also been hanging out with Allison's old friend Mandy, and all of a sudden, Mandy stopped walking home with her after school. 
My daughter is so confused as to why her best friend ditched her.  There was no fight or anything.  She just says that Rose likes Haley better and she wishes she knew what she did wrong. 
My heart is broken for her.  My heart wants to protect her and just shield her from this kind of hurt.  But I can't do that.  I can try and soothe her hurt feelings and keep her busy having fun on the weekends but I can't interfere with her personal relationships.

Instead of focusing on the friend she came with though she kept talking more to me until her song came up.    

Most of my friends left early. By last call, and our friend. They had rides, but I didn't. Julie said I could share her taxi, or I could go home with her. I wasn't thinking too clearly by that time. I should have just gone home, but home was an apartment with barely any furniture and I am still not used to being alone there even after 4 months. I am sorry, but that's just so fucking miserable and depressing, and for the first time in months I was feeling pretty happy. I made the bad decision to go back to Julie's place.

She offered me another beer after we got back to her place, and at some point she started kissing me. I was a little uncomfortable with it, but I shoved it down. My marriage was on the rocks a while before I moved out, and it isn't like it's going to get better, and it had been a long time since I felt like I was wanted. I guess I was just lonely, and Julie was pretty hot. 

One thing lead to another, and Julie was frustrated. Also, even though my wife is leaving for another guy, and she has been horrible, and I know it's over, I felt like I was cheating. I couldn't do it. After a few minutes of trying, I pushed away from her and told her I was sorry, but she must not have because she leaned down and tried to blow me to get me hard again, she got pissed and started yelling and crying and hitting me
    
I don't know how long I wandered around outside. I wasn't very aware of myself or my surroundings and I know I fell down a couple of times. Somehow I ended up at a gas station. The cashier there called one of my friends for me, I told him I was just drunk and tired. I didn't say anything else, and I was glad he didn't ask. I didn't want to talk about it. I just wanted to forget about it. 

Now, that us trying to have sex means I raped her. I told my friend that's impossible. I didn't start anything, Julie did. I didn't try anything with her. She came on to me and when I tried to stop, she didn't stop. I didn't do anything to her.     
    
Now my friends are questioning me and turning against me

You have put the entire family through hell and back. You have broken cheated on your wife countless times, you caused us to go bankrupt, you lost everything for us.

On your 35 birthday you went out ""golfing"", you started to slur you words, you lost control of your body, you had a stroke. We waited hours for you to come back from your ""golfing"" session. You came back 4 months later, crippled, useless, and broken. 

Mom, drive, eat and every other basic thing you need to survive. After gaining the ability of your motor functions back, you sat on your ass for 2 years, making everyone wait on you hand and foot

Finally you start looking for a job, a house, your working, everything is ok. All of a sudden mom is diagnosed with cancer, its curable, but it still takes a toll on the family. While she is going through chemotherapy and radiation, what are you doing? Fucking another women

Mom beats cancer, you bringing in more money then mom but its ok. 

Mom loses her job, and you criticize her for being lazy and not working. You open up a separate bank account and keep all your money to yourself, making the family struggle 

FINALLY everything is staring to look up again, this time we are not sure if he is going to survive, mom is devastated, I am distraught, my brother is fighting for his life, and what are you doing? Finding another mistress.

This time I have had it, as a matter of fact, I don't want anything to do with you. You are not a dad, not even a human in my eyes, you are a monster, you have ruined this family enough and I am sick of it. I don't know how you can do this to your family.

But here I am now. Today is his sixth day here, it's like something changed in me. I'm not self-conscious around him anymore. I feel a thousand times better about myself, which is the single most important thing this relationship has given me. I don't think I've ever been this happy. Before we had sex, being a 21 year old virgin seemed like the most embarrassing thing in the world.

1356660001.0,15jtld,Being an ugly woman is terrible,UnbreakableNokia,358,56,140,"I'm ugly. I know I'm ugly. I have known that I am ugly since I was twelve years old. 

Before then I thought I was simply fat, and realised I was simply, irretrievably, ugly. My most prominent feature is my long, hooked, nose. My eyes are tiny and so close together I can only use children's glasses. I am twenty one and still constantly get large, red spots. My hair is a thick, which leave me with a very broad figure no matter how much weight I lose. I have very small breasts, so there is never an option of blending into the crowd. I am always seen

The world of an ugly woman is different to that of a beautiful woman in so many ways I could not begin to explain it all. I can, and how society treats beautiful women.

My sister is beautiful. I have many beautiful friends. I live in the same world as beautiful women. I am not one of them. They are celebrated, even when beautiful women are indifferent, hostile or even cruel in return. People remember my sister's name and instantly forget me. When we are introduced to new people together, nine times out of ten if I meet that person again they will immediately ask where my sister is, how she is, what she is doing. I am never asked about myself and she is never asked about me. My beautiful friends are photographed by friends and acquaintances. I am silently left out of the records of social events. I am erased from history because I am too ugly to be photographed. Strangers compliment my sister and my friends, strangers insult and ridicule me.

Men might think that perhaps they live in the same world that I do, a man experiencing the same level of public condemnation for their looks that I have faced. The most recent example I can think of is the man who stopped in the street last week to tell me that I shouldn't be wearing tinsel on my head like my friends (we were going for Christmas drinks) because I was so ugly. This is not rare for me and this is not new. This has been my life since I was a young teenager. When I see discussions about catcalling I want to scream at the people who tell women that they should be complimented. What should I do when someone yells at me, unprovoked, that I am an ugly minger? I know I am ugly. There is literally nothing I can do about it. I'm trying my best already!

There is hope for ugly men in popular culture. We celebrate the story of the ugly, inevitably beautiful, female crush to realise how much he is worth on the inside and how worthy he is of her love. That story never happens in reverse. There are just no famous actresses that are anything other than conventionally beautiful. 

Nobody writes books about ugly women. No one makes films or plays, and culture stretching back as far as human memory goes, ugly women are not there. We don't exist and nobody talks about us. Beautiful women are the only women we see or hear about, and most crushingly, the only women we remember. The ugly ones, no matter what they do, seem to be simply invisible. Invisible or evil and bad.

We shouldn't be surprised by this, beautiful princess and the evil, ugly witch. We make this happen.

I am ugly. I will not be remembered. I will never be the protagonist of any story told.

Apart from the incredible patronization, I *do* know better. As to the second point? Well, *yeah*, people tend to have a fondness for where they were born. People like what is familiar.

While I typically don't engage it, that no, in fact, the USA is not a police state banana republic, I get shouted down with cries of DAE SCANDINAVIA?? The utter obliviousness is palpable.

And I'm sure Scandinavian countries have their problems as well.

1370293622.0,1fluhc,The wrong person died.,tkmac69,332,36,55,"My family was incredibly happy. My mother and father were financially secure

My big brother was my best friend on this planet. He was also very likely autistic. He was quiet and shy, acne-covered middle schooler. He was eight years my senior, a former high school goth who was bullied his whole life. He had a profound passion for video games, and I would watch him play for hours at a time. He was the most gifted and talented gamer I've ever witnessed. 

Scott struggled socially, and drugs. Incredibly witty and charming one-on-one, he was a social outcast. He would bring in girls like sick puppies and try to ""fix"" them; nine times out of ten they were mentally ill and would only take advantage of him. 

One such girl was Christine. Christine was a wandering drug addict who only dated Scott so she could stay in our house and use his money for drugs. She got him hooked on heroin with her. Eventually

Whilst pregnant, was born. He was addicted to heroin and went through massive withdrawals, spending the first weeks of his life in the NICU. 

Seeing as his parents were drug addicts, leaving voicemails threatening our lives, calling the police on my father alleging that he was a heroin dealer and my mother was a prostitute, etc. She also bragged about hiring a hitman to murder to my family. 

We kept Cillian and Scott and Christine lived in the house until he was about a year and a half old. Then everything changed. 

Scott and Christine went on a heroin binge in an apartment and they both overdosed. Scott was on the couch and Christine was on the floor. When Scott passed out, as his alcohol levels were too high to be conscious, let alone overdose on drugs; but there was not enough evidence to pursue charges, despite the fact that her first words coming out of a coma were, ""I killed Scott.""

My family fell apart. 14 year old me assumed the responsibility, spending over $50,000 on court fees. How it took so long for us to become his legal guardians baffles the mind; at the time his mother was suing us, she was in jail for prostitution and cocaine possession. The only other possible guardians on her side of the family were her parents, known abusers who fed Cillian beer during some of their few visitations. Her mother wasn't even allowed in the courtroom after she cussed out the judge. Still, five painful years later, we finally achieved full custody. Christine is still turning tricks for money

Here's the fucked up part: We've spent our life savings fighting lawsuits from this family for five years. Five years we have been raising an orphan; his mother is nonexistent. She is required to pay zero child support and is not required to visit him, he doesn't have a mother. She essentially forgot he existed. This is after giving him special needs he probably wouldn't have been born with if she was a responsible or decent fucking human. 

She stole my brother's life; her son's life; my family's lives... and she continues to walk around

He does not remember his father. He will never know his father. He does not know what he looks like or the sound of his voice. He does not know his father's memories or his father's laughter. He does not know his father's embrace; the embrace of the kindest

My mother lost her faith in God

My nephew is an orphan. But he is the only thing left that reminds me of my brother. I will never

I'm in all AP and honours classes, we've been staying until 7pm. I have seven siblings at home who I have to help take care of. Getting home at 8, I have to eat dinner, shower, help out with the kids, and I can't get around to homework until 11. 

So, my panic attacks are flaring, and people are heated about the musical. Over spring break, I cut myself after being straight for almost 4 years. I was ashamed of myself, and I couldn't tell my best friend. I've been keeping up a pretty strong exterior, but today I kind of snapped.

In theatre class, and I just froze. I just stood there nodding at him until the bell rang. I went to the bathroom, broke down, and then went to lunch.

Then, and he basically just told me he knew what was up. I explained to him that I was stressed, and he said that he understood. He brought up that he remembered me trying to tell him before that I couldn't handle the position, but he didn't listen, and he apologised for it. It's just nice that he thought about it. He then proceeded to say I could continue helping out if I'd like, but I wasn't obligated, and if my home life got too hectic

It was just nice that he noticed, yet. She'd be crushed. I'm just glad he took it into his hands to help me out, even though it's definitely not his fault.

*EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words (and some not so kind). I really appreciate it. To clarify, but this time I got a bit overwhelmed and slipped up a bit.

1368140412.0,1e16zm,Confessions of a soon-to-be skinny bitch.,tennesseebred,382,93,133,"**Edit 5-10 10:45 AM** Wow, and this is the result. 

The negative feedback I received, and I'm 21. I can't go one week without someone pointing out how fat I am - whether they are provoked or unprovoked. That's frustrating. That's infuriating, actually. It has made me pretty bitter on the inside about it, *but.* **Let me just get this clear, I don't care what people think about me.** Many of you who had something negative to say where saying something along the lines of ""well you shouldn't care what people think anyway."" I really don't give a shit what people think about me, but that doesn't mean it doesn't sting when I get called a fat ass or a fat bitch. Everybody still has feelings, guys. I live my life the way I want - as is obvious by my multiple tattoos, and different colored hair. I really *don't* care what people think about me

That's another thing I need to clear up: I have accepted the way my body looks, a loving and caring person. I feel beautiful on the inside and many of the people who are in my life would agree to that. But, I am doing myself an injustice by not trying to be my best. Ahisnd being my best includes being beautiful on the outside, too. When I started this weight loss journey, **I wasn't doing it for myself.** I was doing it for everyone else because I was tired of being the fat girl. I wanted everyone else in my life to be satisfied and happy that I was loosing weight. I cried almost every day, I felt like shit almost every day. Then, the first 10 lbs came off. It felt amazing. My jeans were looser. I sat down and took time to actually evaluate why I was doing this, it wouldn't last if I didn't find some motivation. I kept remembering how good it felt to finally have a lose pair of size 22 jeans on me. I remembered how much better my body felt since I had cut out all the processed foods. I sat down and realized I disliked my body

[coralfershoral](http://reddit.com/u/coralfershoral) said it best: ""Giving her the benefit of the doubt here (because I myself have these feelings and I have a boyfriend and I'm only about 10-20 lbs overweight)...
I don't think she NEEDS these things. I just think she wants to have these options in the back of her mind like most thin-bodied girls. She finally wants to have to turn positive attention away, I don't think you guys can quite understand how much I feel like the only way I will be able to *truly* succeed in my adult life is by being thin and good-looking. I'm already well educated, intelligent, and pretty capable of a lot. But, if you can't agree that ""looks get you places,"" you're lying to yourself. I don't ever want to depend on looks to get me anywhere, but it'll certainly be a nice boost in my life. I love my boyfriend, and I'm not looking to destroy that. But there's this ""guilty fantasy"" in my head where one day

[NINETY_3](http://reddit.com/u/NINETY_3) said this: ""I think you can safely ignore most of the people in here. Most of them have no context to understand why you'd be sour on a lot of people. Fat people get to see just how ugly a lot of people really are on the inside. When you drop this weight,** like I had some kind of mutant disease. It's just extra fat, yet I've been treated as if I was subhuman my entire life. Will this solve all my problems? Absolutely not. If I expected it to, I'd be one stupid bitch. But it *will* solve a lot of my problems. Personal and health problems. And trust me, I understand that people will call me names my entire life. I get that, and I'm ready for that. People are just assholes, and that's the way it's going to be. **BUT.** What my goal is with this weight loss, I know it's because they're just trying to dig at me and not because I'm actually fat. Can you understand that? I don't care about being called any names

[worstluckever](http://reddit.com/u/worstluckever) Has the top comment, and it's goddamn annoying to have thighs that rub together when I want to wear shorts. The sweating thing? Would you like to be fucking sweaty for no reason? Like, you have to understand where I'm coming from. I'm not on my way to loathing fat people, more power to them. If other fat people are happy and want to stay fat, FINE! Good for them! I couldn't care less! But, that's just not the journey for me. All those self-hatred things I listed are mine alone, they are a daily annoyance *to me* and things I wish to change *about myself.* Thank you though, and it isn't who I really am.

I'm not even going to use a throwaway because I refuse to be ashamed about my body anymore. I am who I am, don't bother telling me I'm fat and ugly. You can't destroy what's already broken. 

I stepped on the scale this morning, and I am just dying to hit that mark. 30 lbs in four months... remarkable. 

I've lost a jean size. I can actually wear jeans now and I don't have that little bit of belly that hangs over. I can button my jeans

I've been called fat,"" ""fat ass,"" ""ugly bitch."" I can't wait till you're only calling me a fat bitch to dig at me, because I'm fucking beautiful. 

I won't even lie, and that's great. But this is all for looks. Because I want to finally be considered beautiful. I want people to finally, fucking finally, pay attention to me.

So I will finally be pretty enough for guys to want to buy me shots at the bar.  
So that my coworkers will stop making jokes about how fucking a fat girl is disgusting.  
So I can go to the beach and feel okay swimming in front of other people.  
So I won't feel so self-conscious riding a water slide at the water park.  
So I won't just fucking feel self-conscious at all
So when I go to a restaurant
So

So my back will stop hurting.  
So I don't have to worry about ""weight limits"" or ""Am I going to break this?"" when I sit in a lounge chair.   
So when I ride the rollercoaster

And most importantly

Just, ect. I'm a beautiful person on the inside, and I'm not fucking ugly or hideous, but I'm not pretty nor acceptable by society's standards. I can't wait for the day I'm beautiful on the outside too, just so I can tell everybody fuck you. ",,False,t5_2ranw,True

Normally, but we found nothing.  Just as we were clearing from the apartment

It was at that home that we found the source of our 911 call.  It was a bloodbath.  The victim had accidentally shot himself in the leg with a .45 caliber Colt revolver, but even worse was the second call nearly an hour later when his wife called.  Seeing death is never pleasant, but this was intensely troubling to me; not only was it accidental, but his wife, now a widow, was at his feet.  She clutched his shoes, murmuring his name, and asking me if it was real.  She asked him to get up.  She asked him to open his eyes.  She held my hand as I lead her out of the kitchen to her waiting family members outside.  She held me so tight that it sent thundering shockwaves through my heart.  I could almost feel her grief and sorrow.  It was all I could do not to crumble.  I had no comforting words.  I wished with all my heart that I could change what had happened here

I have not been overcome with such grief in a very long time.  I had seen and talked to this man myself a week prior.  He was the victim of theft.  Now, a wife, and a family.  His death was nothing short of absolutely tragic.

After the detectives arrived, knowing that I may deal with things that hurt me, or even kill me.  But beneath the badge and under that uniform is a heart that is nowhere near impervious to these things.

 ""Sorry I just don't like you that way"" 

This pisses me off so much. 

A.If you see a girl you like and you become her friend in hopes of having a relationship with her that's fine. BUT if she declines and you consider it all a waste of time you're not a real friend. You're a fake one. 

B.Most ‘nice guys‘ hate having to be someone’s friend when their only interest was banging or having a relationship with them

C. If you want to be in a relationship with them you have to show some signs in the beginning. I'm not saying anything big

It's one thing to fall in love with someone who doesn't love you back and wants to be friends. Sometimes it can be hard to be friends with a person you're in love with but it's not being ""friend zoned"". You can't help who you or they have feelings for. It's not a waste of time to be someones friend.

And to guys who think if you're super nice a girl will like you, don't bitch about it.

My roommate was a scumbag who would steal money from me to buy cocaine, I got a call from a bartender asking me to bring his drunk ass home after his debit card was declined. He'd bring douchebag bros home with him, and they would stink up the apartment with cigarettes while listening to Lil Wayne till four in the morning. The cops came three times due to noise complaints. The entire time I would sit in my room, lock the door, and secretly hope that one of them would OD on coke or get alcohol poisoning. He would borrow my car without asking, usually when he was drunk, and causally dropped in a conversation once that he didn't know my car could go 125 mph.

I worked at Pizza Hut for five years, but getting promoted to manager was a nightmare. First, our restaurant general manager was a great guy, the best boss I ever had. He was in grad school for Russian studies, and after getting his master's, he moved to Russia to teach English. The guy they got to replace him is the biggest asshole I've ever met. First of all, he had no clue when it came to hygiene. He would show up to work reeking of cat piss, and she swore like a sailor. And to top it all off

So between having to deal with these two excuses for men, April 7, 2010, I lost it. I had an awful shift at work, had to come home to my roommate's asinine antics, then got into a fight with my girlfriend who had an anxiety attack over something I had done almost four years prior. I snapped, kicked her out of my apartment at three in the morning

The next morning, and after almost five years, we were no longer a couple. The next couple months just got rougher. My best friend moved to Tennessee to go to law school, and my mother got into a fight with my ex. And I still had to deal with a deadbeat roommate and the boss from hell.

Every Tuesday, 2010, my ex showed up with her new boyfriend. Watching them hug and kiss was brutal, and my friends bought me drinks out of sympathy. As I sat there, I forgot about the game, I didn't care anymore. My former beloved was across from me kissing her new man, I had to be to Pizza Hut at 8am the next morning for a 12-hour-plus shift with my scumbag boss

I got up and left. As I drove home, my roommate was watching TV and informed me that we were out of beer. I brushed him off and went to my room and waited for him to fall asleep.

When he went to his room and closed the door, and tied it on. I put my head through the loop, but my feet were still on the ground. I remember thinking to myself, ""I can't do anything right, even killing myself."" I got a chair and stood on it, tied the loop smaller, put it around my neck and kicked away the chair. The last thing I remember before I lost consciousness was that I wasn't afraid. Looking back now

The next thing I know, and my entire body felt like it was being poked with pins and needles. I remember more now, but at the time it was so disorienting. After hanging for about three or four minutes, the belt snapped and I fell, waking up my roommate. He came out of his room and saw me convulsing on the floor, so he dialed 911. The paramedics arrived and treated me. I remember being able to hear them, and feel them moving me on to the stretcher, failed

That was when the most heartbreaking part of the whole ordeal happened: My mom came in. She was crying and put her hand on my head, that everything was going to be okay. As I slowly came back, my entire body started to ache. My legs were the worst; they felt cramped like I hadn't moved in days. The doctor came in and explained to my mom and me that I had hit my head pretty hard when I fell, and they wanted to transfer me to a bigger hospital to get a CT scan to see if I had any bleeding in my head. They loaded me into an ambulance and took me. The entire time, I was still strapped down and couldn't move. My entire body was aches and pains. Every muscle hurt, my head was pounding, and my throat was raw.

After arriving at the other hospital, and it was the first time I was alone with my mom, who followed the ambulance. I sobbed on her shoulder for what felt like an hour, then a nurse brought me some lunch. I had to take tiny bites because it hurt so bad to swallow.

I was then transferred back to my hometown hospital and admitted to their behavioral health department. They kept me in confinement for the first night to make sure I wouldn't try to hurt myself again. I took a shower and removed all the electrodes the paramedics had put in me. The inside of my elbows were bruised from all the IVs I had

After my first night, there was a young girl who had postpartum depression and had tried to kill her baby, and there was a lawyer who lost a big case and tried to kill himself. I had a huge blue and purple welt on my neck from where the belt had dug into me, so it must have been obvious to the other patients why I was in; none of them needed to ask.

It was while I was in that ward, and I had some deep talks with the nurses and patients. The lawyer told me about the big case he lost, so he parked his Mercedes in his garage and left it running. His wife had found him and took him to the hospital. I saw his wife when she came to visit and she was breathtaking. I remember thinking that I couldn't imagine why that guy would want to kill himself. He had a big house, a Mercedes, a beautiful wife, and a partnership at a law firm. That more than anything made me realize how depression can happen to anyone. Most of my friends were out of state, and they called almost every day. I was admitted to the hospital on the morning of Wednesday, so I wasn't released until the next Tuesday. I told my folks I was going to move back in with them until I got my life sorted out. I quit my job at Pizza Hut

Three years later and I am in such a better place. I went back to college and graduated this time, which I desperately needed. I got a prescription for Prozac, and had weekly sessions with a psychologist for a year after getting out of the hospital; both helped greatly. My Doc was great, and would help me sort out the thoughts I was having that were harmful or unhelpful. I always considered myself a smart guy in touch with my feelings until then; the Doc helped me even more by pointing out when I was suppressing my emotions or letting them get the better of me.

I almost died. The doctors were genuinely surprised I wasn't comatose, stark, probably wishing she would die before she watched me go. I tried to make peace. But what can that even mean at age fifteen?(Fact: Nothing. Lest not in 'Murica, where adolescence is code for ""free-range prison"".) Instead, I was full of a bitterness and anger that I have carried with me ever since; so bitter that my life was cut short, angry that all I could feel in my heart was bitterness and rage. 

Two bottles of hemoglobin (at $14, never would be) categorized.

It wasn't until I was 19 that I finally tested positive. No doctor has ever connected the dots, officially, even though CMV looks nothing like what I had. Only certain aspects of my condition suggested that result. CMV is carried by a majority of the people on the planet. I want to say %80. It only becomes troublesome when coupled with a depleted immune system, such as that found in the wake of a vicious HIV infection. We're talking late-stage AIDS, not just a weakened immune system. Almost nothing. Zero.

I'm 24 now. I feel like I died in that hospital room, I felt myself change inside. I felt my heart breaking such as I never knew it could. This feeling, a gut-wrenching anguish, like watching someone dump a bucket of bleach on your future. That feeling is always waiting for me if I peek inside. It never left.

It became who I am today. I'll never know the (undoubtedly better) man I would have been had none of this happened. I'll never live a day without resisting my hateful urge to push the blame onto the people I love most. My mother. My sister and father. My friends. But mostly my mom. I love her more than anything in the world

My family and some close friends came to visit me when there was neither a prognosis nor improvement. They said all the things they would say if they knew they would never see me again. I wasn't fully aware this was happening until after the fact. My life was pain.  I just looked at them and tried to smile. I was filled with inexplicable shame for my condition. (Had I know the cause was HIV, especially my eyes, were as yellow as a banana. Bacterial pneumonia came on hard and fast. This feels like fire under your rib cage. 

Worst of all

I struggle every day with this history. At the time only my closest relatives, your troubles are only ever yours forever. Even the worst tragedy will be absolved by those witnesses left scarred by your plight. No matter the outcome, it is cauterized. We've got a knack for it. They came to my bed. They sat quietly. They looked at death, and it was me.   And they forgot. I want to shout that part because the coldness of it is such a shock that you can't help but sputter at the indignity. They didn't change. Of course not. People aren't characters. They don't have arcs, they have lines. They moved on. They walked down the road. Because I survived, and it was highschool, and drama is everywhere, unless they die (and then they get two

The word slut drips with disdain.  It needs no context to be utterly disgusting.  Very few other words hold such a consistently unflattering

As a young woman suckled into maturity at the teat of a patriarchal society

I was raised to believe that self-respect and promiscuity are more or less mutually exclusive.  It was such a prominent mantra in my teen years that I never even thought to question its validity.  In fact it's so ingrained that it still feels mildly uncomfortable to deny, I have come to the conclusion that not only is it an superficial and archaic moral, but one that is degenerative to any woman.  An oasitic empire has been constructed around the value of sex: complete with gilded walls and unnecessarily large towers.  

Maybe it's just me, but if I were I couldn't imagine that it should hold more weight to my self-image than kindness, honesty, loyalty, intelligence, acceptance, courage, integrity

Being sexually conservative is by no means a bad thing.  It's a tremendous display of self-control which should be applauded.  The self-control, waiting anxiously and pleading silently for you to give him the go-ahead?  It's the same concept: the pride you have for your clever puppy is the same pride you should have for yourself.  Withholding from something which is not harmful to you is solely (not to be diminished) a feat of self-control.  That's right.  Sex is not harmful.  It will only ever impact you negatively when done irresponsibly, with malice, or with unreciprocated expectation.  As long as you can discern and avoid those situations, sex is actually fantastic for your health, your mind, and your body.  

Removing the pretty veil someone at some point draped over sex and being able to understand it for what it really is has been one of the most liberating experiences of my development as a woman.  Not only have I been freed from the belief that my sexuality defines my honor, and you can experience intimacy without sex.  As much as one enhances the other, they still exist independently.  

Teaching women that sex is the thing that men need to 'earn' from us is total bullshit.  We have so much more to offer that is so much more valuable.  Sex is pennies.  A woman's love is gold.  Sure, too.  If a man wants pennies, give them to him!  Maybe that's all he wants, but it's his loss and it's important to understand that it's unlikely he'll change. Better to give him his chump change for free and watch him walk off with it, than hold some pennies for ransom until he gets close enough to waste any of your gold on.  


EDIT: Didn't think so many people would read this... I'd like to apologize if I offended anyone and make it clear that all views on sex and personal decisions made on those values should be respected.  The post wasn't about a 'correct' view,False,,t5_2ranw,1351298798.0,,,t3_11mnbf

Before I started my first proper job, always the mood killer. (Although oddly enough racist jokes are perfectly fine with me). 

Then at 16 I got a job at a small printing shop in the little town where I live. Even though the people who live here are quite ""well off"" we live next to an immigrant sinkhole and so we get a mixture of people coming in. 

The British people are so fucking polite. They're a pleasure to serve; black or white, they'll apologise and put things back in the right place, they'll pay for things without question, they won't argue with me. I really, really like the people in my town. 

Asians and Arabs though. Urgh. In Britain what we mean by Asians are not the East Asians, really annoy me now. 

They seem to have no awareness for the social rules in England. It's really starting to piss me off, they'll also try to ""trick"" me into thinking I gave them less change than I actually did. They'll come in their big group of friends, talking loudly, picking things up and leaving them halfway across the shop, and leave without buying anything. They'll complain over everything; the darkness of prints, the quality of paper, and demand I improve their prints for free ""because I'm charging too much anyway"". 

When I first started working here, and for a part that was true. There's a lovely Pakistani woman that comes in every week and always chats to me about my A-Levels and tells me about her son, just like there's the douchebag English businessmen and entitled housemums that really get on my nerves. But I've slowly realised that stereotypes and generalisations are there for a *reason*. Most of the Asians and Arabs that come into the shop fall under this category of "" wow they're so fucking annoying and entitled"". I know the term ""refusal to integrate"" is thrown around a lot, but this is seriously the problem that I can see. I now understand why my white overweight football watching beer drinking boss is such a massive racist. When a lot of these immigrants (a lot of them don't even work), don't even speak the language of the country they're in, and still go by their own values and social rules that don't hold ground in England (for example haggling), it must get pretty frustrating for the locals! The engineer who comes and works on our printers is an Indian man called Dash; he has a cockney accent and he spends the whole day talking to my boss about football, while my boss always pays him up front in cash. His ethnicity does not play a part at all, he understands pop culture and jokes. I wish a lot of the Asian and Arab immigrants in England would just learn proper English and understand the excluding themselves in their own little solitary neighbourhoods and friendship/family groups  is part of the driving force behind the racism towards them. 

Obviously next generation everything will be a bit better. The Asian kids growing up with us are just as British as everyone else; it's just this initial immigrant influx that causes all the problems at the moment. 

I'm just mad at myself because I went and changed my own moral values. And it's totally hypocritical because I'm a foreigner as well. Urgh. ",,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1guo0o/working_a_customer_service_job_has_made_me_a/

I started a new tradition with my gf of almost 2 years of taking her out to a nice dinner the night after Christmas. This year was going great until that family showed up. 

We went to a small fancy Italian restaurant around where I live because I knew it wouldnt be busy the day after Christmas. We were the only people in there, with two kids, around 12-14, who were both mentally handicapped. Well what do you know, but the seat right next to us looked like the best seat in the world, so the mother walked right over and sat down. Didnt seem so bad. A little intrusive, but I was going to deal with it. My gf didnt see any of this

These kids stank to high heaven. They both must have pissed and shit themselves and mellowed in it for a few days. One was much less disabled than the other, so when it came, he started chowing down. Pieces of salad where going everywhere. Some flew over towards our table but never made a full landing. Then he found the ranch.. and thats when it got worse. He started to drool everywhere while eating and never once did he or his mom wipe his mouth. There was white ranchy drool pouring out of his mouth, all over his chin and shirt, and onto the table. The whole time he was eating he was gawking at me. Like full on food in his wide open mouth, staring at me. God it was so disgusting. I know he might not be able to help it, but his mom just sat there and didnt do anything about it. They both kept making weird awkward noises and must have had a fart contest going. 

Then it was time for the entrees. He got some pasta thing, my gf finally turned around and saw what I had been looking at. She completely lost her appetite and we had just gotten our food. She didnt even take one bite. At this point, the mom just continued to sit there and then the other kid started screaming for pizza too. I had enough, so both decided to get to go boxes and leave. 
The waiter mouthed ""Im sorry"" to us as we left. I mouthed it right back because he was the one who had to clean up their mess when they left...

Six years together.

The weekend you left me home alone and throwing up on the couch was the weekend you met her. I remember waking up in the morning and seeing all the photos on facebook. Your arm was around her in every single one. I thought that was weird. It made me uncomfortable.

After everything you had put me through in the past, I believed you. Completely.

The next two weekends

I knew what was happening. But I thought it was just like every other time. I thought you just needed to know that you could still get girls to want you.

I did my hair. I wasted an obscene amount of money on clothes. I cried. You told me you loved me. You told me you wanted to grow old with me. I looked at the photos over and over and over. 

For the next month you let me believe that that was it. You had gotten that feeling of being desired that you needed

And then you told me maybe things would get better if we took a week or two apart. Maybe I should stay with my mom just for now, you had her as your new girlfriend. She had been your new girlfriend for the past month. You had just been waiting to stumble across a cowardly excuse to get rid of me.

It's been six months. You two have a new house together. After six years with you

Six god damn years. You were the only person in my life who has ever really known me. My own mother hasn't even come close. I trusted you, the one person I trusted with my well-being. But I can not handle the fact that you left me for her.

So....last night I just drank some wine with a guy that had been interested in me and was super sweet. After quite a few glasses of wine things started to heat up and we moved to the bedroom. I asked if he had a condom and after him asking me if I was sure thats what I wanted. IT. HAPPENED. haha It's so funny because really it was like not a big deal at all! All these years I have been thinking that this one moment would define how I look at relationships and that my first time would be this magnificent thing that you see in the movies. It wasn't like that at all. I honestly would compare it to brushing my teeth, there is no wrong or right time to have sex. Just be comfortable with yourself and do what you feel.

When he ruined your credit

What did I tell you? Oh yes. It was what I really needed was my mommy.

You let the new boyfriend (now your husband) talk you out of coming. He needed you didn’t he? You had to take care of him and his children didn’t you? You didn’t have the time to come drive with me. I was an adult and could take care of myself now… Right mom? Isn’t that what you said? That his 12

This was when I learned in my life that the only person I can depend on is ME. ME ALONE. Now that I am back in town and I am turning 28 you cant even see me for our shared birthday. I was your best friend. I am your child and I cant even have a relationship with you because of your new husband. Its devastating that I cant even take you to lunch when I give you a whole week to pick a day. You are unemployed still. You have the time.

I’m done. Today was the last time I will ever try to have you in my life again. Now I just have to heal the devastation you have brought and move on. I look forward to the day when this doesn’t hurt so bad anymore.

When it comes to my younger brother and I, won several accolades along the way, got a great job teaching kids math and science, and did everything I could to make my parents happy and proud.

My brother, did all kinds of drinking and drugs, has been a huge financial drain on my parents (extra years of college, years of unemployment, etc), and after a huge wedding, got divorced a year and a half later.

BUT, and he is charismatic.  He can shmooze with just about anyone and they fall in love with him.  I, on the other hand, am the awkward one.  I've been overweight my entire life, I've always been academic and nerdy, and I definitely got the short end of the stick when it comes to good looks.  As my mom once told me as a teenager, ""Your brother will always be able to get by with a flash of his smile - you're always going to have to try harder""

I always have ""tried harder"", as he's reserved and not outgoing and social like the rest of my clan.  I have a great house, a great career that my dad doesn't respect (he thinks teachers are lazy, whiny  folks who abuse the system to get great pensions and benefits), and a great circle of supportive friends.

Last night everyone was drinking at a family event.  Someone asked my mom who her favorite child was, it still hurts when I'm the child who's done everything right by the book.  I'm the one who's never gotten arrested, never broken my jaw because I got in a fight at a bar, never sexually abused someone, never drained money from my parents (who are well-off and can afford it), and have never dragged my folks through the emotional ups and downs that he has.  He's still unemployed but has matured a bit in his 20's and is dating a charming girl who can support him financially, and as my mom now loves to say ""He drove me nuts growing up, but that's what happens when you're not the chick squawking the mostly loudly in the nest

I think my next move is to distance myself more and more from my family.  I'll still see them throughout the year as my extended family is always having social events and get togethers, and be the more nerdy, awkward child that I am without worrying about how much I'm pleasing them.

He was really mad that I didn't tell him before.  But he didn't yell at me. he just hugged me and said he was sorry i was all alone at home so much and that we would figure out what to do.

after that we took her to the vet and he said that her infection was clearing up. My dad made me tell him what happened and the vet checked her again and said that before when we brought her in she was kind of swelled and red but he didnt think that she was actually raped.

so, seriously fucked up even just with his pants down ""pretending"".

HOLY FUCK GET OVER YOURSELVES. Seriously every other day there is a post being like OMG my girlfriend has a sexual past, there are many, many guys (PUAs, if you will) who try to have as much sex as possible. That's not to say posts with girls uncomfortable about their boyfriend's past don't happen, but they happen MUCH, MUCH more commonly with the roles reversed.

Usually the advice is pretty solid, as long as they are safe and don't get pregnant or spread STDs then WHO CARES. Jesus. If she cheats on you then she's a cheater, but JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LIKES SEX DOESN'T MEAN THEY'LL CHEAT ON YOU HOLY SHIT

Often times these posts give the ages of the girl between 25-30 and they are like OMG 30 PARTNERS THAT'S SOME GOLD STAR SLUTBAG MATERIAL

Alright, that is already 16 sexual partners by age 25! And that is ONE sexual partner every six months! Say they have a year long relationship, alright that is 15 sexual partners, but then say they have no relationship for a year and  have a 1 night stand every two months for that year, oh shit that's another 6 sexual partners in 1 year! That makes it 21 partners total by age 25!

She told me that my friends hated me too. She would say things like ""you think they like you? Those girls hate you. I had to beg them to play with you. If it weren't for me

As I grew older, when I could drink, and what drugs I could use. She painted all of my family (extended and immediate) as the enemy and convinced me to cut all ties with them. She isolated me and made me think that she was all I had. She stopped touching my when I entered middle school but she would use her sexuality to upset me for fun. I think she knew that I had PTSD from her abuse. She would wait until I fell asleep and brought guys into the room and have sex right next to me, often knowing that it was waking me up but I was too traumatized to do anything about it. She would bring her boyfriends into our living room while I would be watching tv and start to fool around and have sex with them next to me on the couch. She would tell me details about her sex life with this evil smirk, speaking louder when I begged her to not make me listen. She would grab and touch me randomly, holding tighter when I struggled but then playing it off like I was being a ridiculous brat for getting upset. 

All through my teens, but a social recluse and a freak if I wasn't having sex. She has tortured me for years and I can't take it any more. I can't look at her without having flashbacks. I now recognize that she is a very sick person and has used me throughout the years to feel powerful and that she just makes me feel awful because that is how she feels and it makes her feel better. 

She moved out for a couple years and I really started to get healthy. I messed up in school pretty badly because of the depression and ptsd but I'm trying to get a college degree and make something out of myself. A little over a year ago, I started to do poorly in my courses. I'm living at home, going to a community college. I can't afford to move out and don't even have any kind of college fund, so I don't know how to get out. I've stopped going to school because I know something has to change before I can focus enough to do well. I'm working two jobs and barely paying my bills. I'm actually in a good amount of debt. I don't know what to do.

I have this deep, I just think about how much better I would feel if I could just stab her a hundred times, cover her in gasoline, and burn the house down with her body inside. I dream about doing it, and I just want more than anything for her to die. I hope every time she leaves the house that she gets raped and murdered. I can't stand feeling her presence anymore. The first night she was back, I sat on the floor having a violent panic attack until the sun came up. I cried and gasped for breath for hours, feeling her fingers grope and force their way inside me. I just wanted to take a knife from the kitchen and plunge it into her while she slept.

I really don't know what to do at this point. My illness is keeping me from having a good relationship with my boyfriend, and myself. I don't think I'm going to kill her (I'm more likely to kill myself, though it would feel like she won). I just want to with every fiber of my being. To see my mom dote on her like she is this precious angel makes me want to vomit. She uses my mom's depression to manipulate her into paying her bills (my parents are poor and struggle to make ends meet) and giving her everything she needs so she can live like a teenager in her mid twenties. I hate seeing it and I can't take it any more.

**[Update](http://redd.it/1k3hz3)**

First

This will be my final update

I called her today, then debunked it quickly. I *did* setup the questions in a way to favor certain responses, so I could have something ready. After everything was presented, she stuck to saying that she was where she said she was. 

She quickly (which I expected) tried to turn it around on me. About how she couldn't believe that I didn't trust her over all these years. Which isn't true. I blindly trusted her, etc. I didn't do anything until these enormous red flags. 

She started playing out these ""what if"" scenarios. Saying that if she were at the other state, and that if she wanted to go there, that I would have a problem with it because the guy was there, too. I told her that if she were upfront about it, I would have explained my worries, but would have completely understood and encouraged her to go despite my uneasy feelings about it.

Finally, telling me she was going to go (as in hang up), and pretty much breaking up with me while blaming me for snooping. It has been a few hours, and I haven't heard anything from her, and I haven't tried to contact her.

The only thing I ask is that people refrain from the reddit default responses of ""fuck that bitch"" ""what a whore"" ""stupid cunt"". It is what it is. I don't know if she cheated, and she lied in a huge way. There would be no way of building trust back up after this, so that's the end.

Anyway

I just don't understand how you can have such little logic.

Today I was tasked with damage control and the complaints are so stupid and pathetic I really don't understand how these people can function.

*""I had to line up for 2 hours to get on x ride""*

We don't force you to get in that line. We don't allocate 2000 people at any given time to that ride. YOU. YOU,000 people on the premises you're going to have to line up at one point and the more people there are the longer the lines will be.

*""My boyfriend is only an XL but was too big to fit in your rides. Now he's embarrassed and our day was ruined.""*

He was bigger than an XL. We have special ""fat seats"" for people. Don't blame us for your boyfriend being a fatass.

*""We had to pay $10 for the parking lot!""*

You're paying for all day parking. That's 9am-6pm. $10 is a fair price. Most day rates are $10

*""I wanted to buy a fast pass but they were sold out!""*

We can only sell 400 a day. If everybody had a line skip ticket it wouldn't be a line skip anymore.

*""It's $120 for a fast pass! What a rip off""*

No

*""My kids weren't tall enough to go on anything""*

I'm sure you own a measuring tape at home. All our height restrictions are available online before you come

*""There was nowhere good to eat""*

We don't have a McDonalds, Taco Bell or whatever chain you want. A burger from our grill stops tastes just as good, stop bitching.

*""There were several gypsy families visiting this day

Yes, please don't come today we're expecting a lot of black people. Sorry, please stay away today, we've got a bunch of French school kids. It's illegal and discriminatory.

*""There are no prices on the food carts so you have to pay high prices  because you don't know what you'd ordered""*

Now this is just laziness. I saw it all the time when I was a cart-slinger. It is illegal to not display the prices, OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NO PRICE, WHAT A RIP OFF!

*""What do you mean prices for limited time extra attractions go up at peak times?!""*

Just seriously? That's how nearly everything works.

Now I'm not defending my company. They are a bunch of money grabbing buttfucks who force their workers to aggressively sell from the second you set foot in the park but most of these are common sense and they're too stupid to realise it.

But you know what? You're right; my girlfriend should apologise. On her behalf, my girlfriend's unreasonable. She's a huge germaphobe with an unrealistic standard for clean and I'm sorry she's already made the compromise to lower them while she lives with your daughter.

But the thing I can't get over is the fact you've had the gall to accuse my girlfriend of being lazy and doing nothing around the house. You think your daughter's special because she takes a summer course ONLINE and works two jobs? My girlfriend is taking the equivalent of 1.5 credits this summer, since one of these courses is a language course, she's trying to learn a new language. Don't forget the countless readings, assignments and essays she's had to write. I guess the articles she's been writing for the school newspaper don't count either.

On top of all that, my girlfriend should be pulling her own weight in the house. Because she obviously has the time to do it.

But know your daughter's gone too far. She's accuse my girlfriend of being a slut because I've spent a couple nights over. You want the truth? Here's the truth: Your daughter's a lying bitch. Since the start of the summer two months ago, has had her boyfriend over for a minimum of 15 out of 30 days. And those are the days my girlfriend's been around to count. 

And the worst thing is? You're gonna win. My girlfriend already feels like a stranger in her own home. And, that house is going to fall apart. For the first time in her life, she'll have responsibilities and she'll have to take care of the place by herself.

Oh wait, and you'll come and pick up all her messes. Because she's mommy's little girl who always gets what she fucking wants.

No

Seriously

Also one thing else that pisses me off is how all ""ugly"" guys ***ONLY*** goes after the hottest girls

The funny thing is that, *you* are obsessed with hot girls and doesn't notice rest of the girls.**

The douchiest guys I've met in my life are ALWAYS the ones that consider themself ""the poor nice guys"". Yes, I've spent all my life being friend with only guys, I've never had many female friends and I'm used to being ""one of the guys"". I have guy-ish interests, games etc, and I'm well, just used to being ""one of them"" when we hang out.

But I don't look like a tomboy, pretty cute and totally OK attractive. So, whenever I meet new guys, the ones you ""nice guys"" describes as the ""douchbags"", (or as they were in highschool or collage, the popular guys) most of them just accept me as one of their friends. Yes, they might try to hit on me. And yes, they will be okay with it

But what happens when I meet you ""nice guys""? Do you find me as an equal to one of your male friends? **NO**, but just noob:ifies them when you meet one...*). And do you introduce me to the rest of your friends and do NORMAL FUCKING FRIENDLY STUFF WITH ME? No. No you don't. Because you see me as a *girl* and nothing else. Like I'm not a human being, I'm a vagina on two legs and nothing more. I'm either your girlfriend or the meanest bitch ever. 

Do you know how much it hurts me, and EEEVERYONE of you asks me out, but then I finds out that just the day before you were all hanging out and drinking - without inviting me? If you can't accept me into your life like a normal human being, I'M NOT GOING TO FUCKING DATE YOU.

And if we say I *would* start to date one of this group guys, B, C, D and E hanged out with each other without inviting me. No, I won't fucking date you again if you do this.

This happens all the fucking time. Stop making me different just because I happened to be born the other gender. If it wouldn't be for the fact that I love pink dresses I would be a transexual without any doubt

And also, I think you can realize that yourself. Also, I would MUCH rather hang out with, or date, or whatever, with a guy who **treats me like a normal human being and includes me in his life and wants to be my friend, that then talks about my ass behind my back (lol no pun intended), who *also* talks about my ass behind my back (even if you're of course the ""nice guy"") but doesn't include me shit in your life.**

Sorry for ranting. If you were me

Today, and in the small stair entrance (where it was blistering hot, the aircon doesn't really reach up there) a well dressed woman was sitting on a bench with a little girl maybe around 6 or 7 basically squatting on the floor doing some homework looking thing. The woman kept yelling at her and bent over to slap her several times as I passed. She was basically yelling at her to do it right, why couldn't she write it right, if she didn't hurry up and finish she would leave her there, and so on. It gave me a bad taste in my mouth, but I just sort of hurried by and wondered why on earth they were there...

Fast forward about an hour and a half. I am done with the meeting and head home. I do a little shopping and head to the car. The mother and child are gone from the top of the stairs, pretty much straight in front of me. The same woman is there screaming at the little girl, who I presumed was in the car because I couldn't see her. And when I say screaming, I mean hysterical screaming. And I could hear the little girl just crying and crying. I didn't know what to do. I just kind of stood there and considered the options - I took down the plate number, and debated calling the police or just going down to the shopping center security...

And then the woman hopped in the car, then flew out of the lot. The little girl's notebooks and what looked like school papers were just laying there on the ground and sort of flying about. I got in my car and drove slowly over past... And the little girl was curled up on the ground between the parking blocks.

I stopped the car, saw the little girl, starting freaking out with me and asking what happened. Then the little girl started to get up, and starting crying for mommy.

The guy scooped her up and we basically ran inside and down the escalator. She had little bloody holes all over her arms. It looked like she had been stabbed by a pencil or a pen. All over her hands and arms. She had blood coming out of her nose and mouth and had black eyes... And was crying for her mommy. She kept saying ""it doesn't hurt, I was stupid, mommy mommy, I'm sorry I'm sorry"" Over and over again. We went to the first shop at the bottom of the stairs and they called security, and covered her in a big towel. 

The police came first then an ambulance, does daddy hit you? Did daddy do this? And she shook her head and said ""Daddy does different things..."" And curled up in a little ball until the ambulance took her away. 

I went with the police to the service area

When I was finished and leaving

I went and sat in my car and cried for about ten minutes before I felt like I could drive. I still can't stop shaking when I think about it. I broke down once I got home and told my husband what happened. 

She had all these little stab-like wounds up and down her arms

I still feel sick. I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight.

1359946144.0,17udie,"Fuck you. I am NOT marrying your son, and you ruined,my birthday.",bitelulz,280,92, decided to invite herself, without any invitation or warning. I was looking forwards to a nice family dinner followed by an episode of Sherlock

This rage is not coming out of nowhere. This woman has shown up to our house expecting to be fed at least once a week for about six weeks.now. After taking up our time, she starts giving us what she calls ""friendly advice"", which is really just her pointing out all of our flaws and insecurities. She talks about stuff that is NONE of her business and that she has no real understanding of (family issues is her favorite topic), and that she is really in no position to comment on. This woman really does not have any part of her own life together, she's really the least-qualified person to give any kind of advice.

She always brings her son, is autistic. He's fairly mild, but his mother has coddled him and limited him so much that he's completely dependant on her and never matured past 13 or so. He's 22 now, and doesn't even bother trying to go to college, get a job, or generally try to become even the slightest bit more independant. All he does all day is play video games, and all he talks about is Magic: the Gathering. He's a pretty nice guy, but neither of us is really interested. His mother seems to have this idea that I would make a perfect wife for her son, we've barely spoken, but this crazy woman thinks that I'm going to get FUCKING MARRIED AND MOVE INTO HER HOUSE!!!!! And would you like to exactly why this woman thinks this? Would you like to know her thinking behind this belief? Well

My parents are very nice people, and has no idea how to not be open and generous with everybody she meets. My dad is very shy and socially awkward (we think he's got mild Asberger's), and has no idea of how to deal with even normal people, much less this lady. I have a very strict personal code that I hold myself to, and part of that code is always being polite and courteous to everyone, whether they deserve it or not, and always being respectful towards my elders. I have been trying to communicate to this woman that we would appreciate if she would not just invite herself over, but I don't think the message got across at all.

When I got home from doing some grocery shopping with my mom, and her boyfriend (who refuses to even acknowledge my existence or attempt to participate in any conversation with me or any member of my family) were all sitting in my living room. My dad was unsure of how to react, and my sister was hiding in her room. I told my mother that she had to explain to them that we were going to have a family night and that they had to leave, and she said that she would, but she chickened out and started making dinner for them too. I was FURIOUS. It takes a lot to get me angry, but once I am angry, I basically Hulk out. I knew that if I stayed there for another minute, so I grabbed my car keys and left

I lived my 18 years in a religious, and still gave me chance to explore things I like.

Since I was young I've always had a fascination on dinosaurs and space, I've never had much attachment to the concept anyway. I've decided to help people and do good because i want to help people and do good, not because I want to please God. I kept this atheistic view to myself, because I'm afraid of angering and disappointing my parents (They're not quick to anger and very understanding, nor am I edgy and think they're mean, it's just that the thought of them being disappointed scares me so much). So I kept doing the whole islamic routine for the last 4 years while my heart's not into it.

I knew this couldn't last forever though, I just couldn't lie and say yes to him anymore. I said nothing and left it at that. I spent the next few months getting depressed about thinking how I should say it and how it would affect our relations in the family. 

Today is the start of the Ramadhan month, nor any other religion's on that matter. My dad asked me why, how can I be sure, etc etc. My mom was silent the whole time. We discussed various topics on it. In the end, they're very understanding and supportive about it, said that I should believe what I believe.

The man spent a month in jail in contempt of court over cursing out his judge and threatening his life after he refused to put my brother in his custody (his mom was off the deep end in drug abuse and had repeatedly abused him, but at the time it would have set a precedent to give a father custody in that area).

I've been lucky enough to spend the last few months home with him, taken him to every doctors appointment, rushed him to the hospital countless times, and then taken him into work (against my will) right as he's released.  

Finally his years of only thinking about others instead of himself caught up to him.  After countless transfusions, his liver lost enough function for his kidneys to shutdown, and with that the remainder of his organs.

1369678294.0,1f5d8p,Online Dating Is Horrible,Mitchla,250,40,98,"Let me go through a scenario with you all;

You're a long-time singleton in a full-time job and little spare time to meet other people. So you decide to get yourself on a dating website for the chance to speak to new people.

You go through the whole rigmarole, you start looking for people to contact.

Now since you're just starting out you don't go ahead and contact everyone. So naturally you're more picky. You carefully scour the whole site using various search terms to find someone you feel you would like to meet.

Eventually you do, and to boot they're attractive. Great. So spend some time reading their profile, making some notes as you go, then crafting a message to them. Not too wordy, chat about what you both like, what you like, some interesting facts about yourself etc. After making sure you've hit all the salient points (never once going to the route of ""ure so sexy"", you send off the message and wait for a reply.

A day goes by. Two. Three. You check the search results again. She's been online since you sent the message. Maybe she hasn't gotten around to reading it? You leave it

A week has gone by. Still nothing. Maybe the message didn't send? So you write up a new one. You politely explain that you're sorry if you've sent her the same message again

...she's blocked you.

Now this is weird. Why would she block you for one message? It's not like you said anything creepy or untoward. You were just saying a quick hello and seeing if you wanted to talk. Could be any number of reasons though. It's a shame

So you try this a few more times with a few more people on the site you think you'll be compatible with. Again no replies come. You don't force the issue

But deep down it gnaws at you, men often get berated for being too shallow when it comes to women. Maybe you should keep an open mind.

So you start messaging more people. Many of them you don't see anything like a deep connection. Their profile is threadbare and only really says they like to go out. Well who doesn't? You still have some criteria; live in local area

Still nothing. Not a single reply. And each time you've read their profiles, can they?

So you get paranoid. You start combing through your profile, mental? Take that out. Leave the bit about going to the gym though, infact why not put in cycling in there? That picture you've got on, you're not smiling enough. Take that away too. Longest relationship maybe? Put that as three years. It's a lie, but maybe they're just not trustworthy of guys who haven't been in long-term relationships.

Even with these changes

Desperation sets in. Every day you send a message to every new member. You must seem like some kind of crazy person to them, what a loser"". You shake your head. You're being paranoid again. There's nothing wrong with you, is there?

One day there comes a turning point. You're going through the search again. You're staring at a sea of faces of people who, they just never replied to you. You try to tell yourself there's a difference, but to your mind being ignored by hundreds of women is akin to rejection. And on a grand scale.

That's when you take off all the filters. Even some of the deal breakers such as whether or not they take drugs. You hit the search button. Some new faces appear

You see one profile, but to you? You got into their profile. There's nothing you have in common. But you're desperate for something anything. ""She'll do"" you resign to yourself, and you send out the briefest of messages. Maybe you try to self-sabotage a bit by not putting as much effort in as possible. In the back of your mind, you don't want this one to be replied to. You think you don't really want to speak to them, you're just trying to prove a point.

Except they do message back. They're one of the first ever to do it.

That's when it hits you like a truck. The only reason you messaged this person is because no one else would speak to you. You didn't even want to have anything to do with this person in a date capacity at all. You just decided to settle. You read through their reply. You might be making it up

Immediately you feel like a complete sack of shit, but no one would reply to them. And now as you sit here, failing to gain any sort of attachment whatsoever, despair sets in in it's totality. You realise just how indifferent you feel to this woman. You feel like the world's biggest asshole for even messaging her in the first place. You daren't even reply back, you feel that horrible about yourself.

So you delete your profile. This is just getting too much. You've hit rock bottom, you bemoan, you lose sleep over it.

Yet you have to carry on. Why? Because everyone around you says it'll get better. That you've just got to ""get yourself out there"" and the right person will come along. Well to them I say this;

I've been through the above scenario on several dating websites for the past six years. In that time I've been on a total of three dates. One was with someone who immediately said they didn't want to see me again after the first date

I know it's a strangers word to take on face value, and how I always go out of my way to help out others and make others happy. That may sound egotistical, but it's something I do try to follow through with. Just because I'm miserable doesn't excuse me from treating others like shit.

I had broken up with her a bit before because it was long distance, but I still texted her because what the hell. I then found out too late about her troubled past: her father had molested her and her siblings, and she claimed he was the man who kept the little kid in that bunker in Alabama. She was also transgender, and the surgeon who performed the SRS on her was unlicensed, causing her extreme pain daily. She threatened suicide, and I managed to talk her out of it.

Fast forward to Valentine's Day. I hate Valentine's Day, I ignored her follow-up text. It was only my name. Now, 90 minutes ago, I received the following text.

Sister: 18

Cousin


When I was a child, and I would stay for days at a time every couple of weeks during the summer. 
My grandmother's husband was technically our step-grandfather, but we never had even a slight reason to distrust him.

In the summer of 2006, which was very unusual. I slept in the large bed in the back bedroom instead of sleeping in the same room as my sister (a room that had two twin beds). I will always regret it.

That night

After these events, she made it impossible. She claimed that it wasn't her husband that committed the events; apparently, he was on some mix of medications that made him snap. She said he was still in Heaven and that I would go to Hell if I did not forgive him. She called me a hateful person because I was so angry.

My cousin, so we were very close as children. She was close to my sister as well, and I never imagined that she would not be supportive. I wish I had been right. A couple of years ago, when she turned 18, K got an ""RIP"" tattoo in memory of my grandfather. She posted this on facebook, even though she was friends with my sister. She claimed that she would not blame him for one little mistake and that we needed to just get over it. She (and other family members) frequently post statuses about how they wish my grandfather was still here. It is not just one or two of my family members that feel this way; it is my entire paternal family. They blame my parents for breaking our family apart.

**TL;DR:** My sisters have financially fucked up the family and are consistently ungrateful for the many thousands of pounds my parents have wasted on them. I feel like I'm suffering the most because my sisters deserve their shitty situations whereas I have done nothing but excel academically and demand little financially (I'm aware of how arrogant that sounds)

***

My two big sisters have fucked everything up for my family for separate reasons. I think they share the generic temperament of one of my parents

But yeah, where my sisters have handed themselves shit.

***

**Sister one:**

Sister one is now 23

Through her teenage years, this is an example of her fuckuppery.

The main fuckup was when she was about 18 she started to go out with this wanker who was about 35. This guy was living off benefits and had beat previous girlfriends in the past. He had a scam going on. He would go out with a girl for a few years while using her bank details to purchase expensive things for himself. He'd then dump them when he was done.

As if this wasn't bad enough, we were having trouble with it. My sister and her scumbag boyfriend were staying over for a weekend. He lied about having computer knowledge, saying he could fix it. Instead of fixing it, he **intentionally** deleted **all** personal documents of **every** family member. This included Sister B's **coursework**, my parents' important **work documents** as well as some only copies of photographs from family events etc.

Anyway

Eventually

This is the main fuckup. She is a massive and constant financial drain to my parents who have given her so much in return for literally nothing. Just this month they bought her a fucking car. Why? She injured her ankle when drunk and now requires a manual car to not be in minor pain from using the clutch on her usual stick car.

Another recent fuckup: the shower in her flat broke so she went to her boyfriend's (who is OK) mother's house to shower. Because of this

Fuck you

***

**Sister B:**

Sister B did the same drugs and alcohol and stuff as sister A. She was taken home by the police at 13 years of age for standing on a street corner smoking at 2am. No prizes for guessing what she was probably doing.

Only difference is, she went out of her way to have sex with someone because she thought it would be cute to have a child.

And now, my parents, the grandparents, are doing her parenting duties. They have some kind of legal thing that means they are sort of half guardians but they don't have complete guardianship of their granddaughter, my niece.

She's dating some guy right now who is an alright guy but he's perfectly satisfied laying down that floor material playgrounds are made out of for the foreseeable rest of his life. He's a stereotypical chav

Strangely, she's a total bitch to my family and him. When he stays here he's a total pig. He doesn't flush the toilet or wash up and when he shaves he leaves the sink covered in his shaved off hair.

Anyway, you don't do shit for me!"". She said that... **In front of her three year old daughter**. While crying and blithering.

I'm pretty sure she has a mental disorder. I'm not saying that to insult her, she'll swear at you for reaching across her to get some BBQ sauce (which actually happened to my mother a few days ago. This was just after my sister asked my mother to cut my niece's pasta for her, since she doesn't like doing it. Crazy bint.)

For some reason she applied to join the police force. She failed the basic psych tests. God knows what they'd do if they looked into her background.

The only reason she hasn't been kicked out of the house is because she'll take her daughter (who she named with a stupid ditsy name

And then there's me, my sisters would spend that same free time getting high.

For my A levels I'm doing Psychology

I'm glad my dad and I get along well. He's the only breath of sanity I get in this fucked up family. My mum's pretty messed up too

You were nine years old.

My heart broke.  It shattered into a billion tiny pieces, it's ""waiting for the universe to provide"".  It's not dumpster diving, its ""a free cold meal"".  It's not living in a bus, it's ""a cross-country camping adventure"".  She dragged you through her trail of chaos and never a hint of how bad things had gotten.

I filed for custody.  She ran with you.  Did she ever tell you?  What did she tell you the reason was for leaving town that weekend?  I promised you I'd see you again in a couple days

I won the case because she didn't show up.  I got everything I asked for because she didn't show up.  I now have full custody with no unapproved contact, she's calling it ""growing wings and flying away"" now?  Usual ""pretend everything's fine"" spin.  If she pretends it was her choice, she doesn't have to admit that it's actually reality catching up with her.

Soon you'll be here with me.  You won't see her for a very long time.  Will you be upset?  Relieved?  Worried about your little brother and sister?  Happy to not be living on a bus with several adults, it was because she'd heard I found you and was arranging for a person to serve the papers?  Will you believe me when I say I've never stopped worrying about you, never stopped thinking about you, never stopped wishing I could have you back in my life?  Will you believe me when I tell you how much I love you?  Will you believe me when I tell you I've been working for years to get my life in order enough to bring you here?  Will you believe me when I tell you that you're the only reason we were looking at a larger apartment?  That third bedroom I talked about, the one whose mention made you so sad nine months ago...  That bedroom was for you, so you would have privacy and space, so you would have a larger bedroom than your whole shared living space has been for 2 years.

You're ten years old now.  I still have your Christmas and birthday presents safe.  They're still wrapped, dental, vision - ready to get your body fixed up.  There's homeschool curriculum to get you ready for the real world.  There's a line on our cell plan and a phone for you - it's not really fancy, but it's Android and it's yours.  I can't wait to see your face when you find out.

I don't know who you are anymore.  You changed from a little kid into a big kid, what you want out of life, I don't know any of it.  Well, you like video games - what ten year old boy doesn't, right?  I want to know you.  I want to know what kind of incredible person is underneath all that shit she piled on you.  Are you an actor?  An artist?  A musician?  A programmer?    I want to see you grow, learn, change

1346769422.0,zc50y,To the drunk college kid who harassed me and my wife the other night,ThrowAwayAngryGuy,223,24,59,"
You were obviously drunk.  My wife and I rounded the corner a block away from the house you were standing in front of and we could tell even from that distance that you were intoxicated.  You were standing with several other college-age males in front of a rundown house broadcasting loud music.  We could see numerous other people on the front porch and it looked like lots of people were inside.  Looked like folks were having a great time.

We crossed to the other side of the street specifically to avoid you.  As we got closer we saw and heard you harass two young girls as they tried to walk past you on the sidewalk.  As we passed you (on the other side of the street) you turned and looked at us

Let me let you in on a few things.  First of all, I would bet good money that we are profs at the college you go to (I might be wrong but I’m assuming you’re a college kid as you and your friends looked the part your house is only 4 blocks from campus in an area dominated by students, and classes start this week so lots of parties are going on).  I hope for your sake that you are not in our classes.  We remember quite well what you look like.

Second

Third, but I can’t think of a better way to describe her.  She’s very shy and soft-spoken and kind.  She weighs in at 100 pounds sopping wet.  She doesn’t drink or party or curse, and she was not only offended by your behavior, she was legitimately scared.  You are a pretty big guy and you really rattled her already grieving mind.  She kept looking over her shoulder and was afraid maybe you were following us or something.  When we went for a walk the next night she specifically requested that we not go anywhere near the house you were at.  She’s now afraid to go down that street.

Lastly, it took everything I had to hold myself back from walking across that street and beating your sorry ass into the pavement.  If the stars were not aligned for you that night, I would have done exactly that.  If my wife had not already spent the previous three days crying over her lost loved one, I would have shown you just what can happen when you behave obnoxiously to the wrong guy (and his girl).  I just didn’t want to make her night suck even more than it already was.  An evil part of me hopes you are my student this term.  An even more evil part of me hopes I run into you in a dark alley.

Yesterday I walked into American Eagle with the hope of finding some new jeans. The stylist brought me a size two. I wasn't offended or hurt by her assumption of my size. I tried them on and they fit perfectly. I looked in the mirror and I didn't feel fat

After a five year battle with my ED yesterday was a mile stone. Its been three months since the last time I purged and I've been eating almost 2500 calories a day in attempts to gain weight. I weight lift five to six days a week

Yesterday I bought size two jeans and it feels amazing.

EDIT:I didn't have anyone to talk to who would really understand why buying size two jeans was such a big deal to me. So thank you reddit for reading and for all the kind words/advice. You guys are great :)

I could tell he was disappointing but then he smiled and looked at me and said ""Alright but I'm not going to give up on you"" He sorta laughed and I did too. It didn't bother me


So Friday came along


I laughed and said sure and he touched it and then this guy behind me(we will call him **billy**) said ""Hey don't you touch him you faggot"" I quickly turned and looked at him to see if he was just joking but based on his southern accent, I assumed he wasn't.


Me-""excuse me?""

 
Redneck-""Why would you let a faggot like him touch you like that


I stood up


At that point the gay kid ran out and the professor came between me and the redneck and I explained what happened. The professor just told everyone to go home and he told me to go cool down

1354773092.0,14dchc,Raped by a Feminist,AthrowWawayK,277,91,682,"Throwaway because a few people may or may not know of my username.

Ladies and gentlemen

Some background story. I know of a girl (let's call her Mary). A few years ago, asked if they had sex to which he replied yes. Mary left and started calling her friends that were with her at the event asking how she was during said event as it was very hazy from her memory. The responses Mary gathered were that she was not looking very good due to the booze and had to be taken back sooner than anticipated. This is how Mary and the guy ended back at his place where they had non-consensual sex. Mary went to the president of the fraternity and told him of the details and they filed a police report. The guy was apprehended and tried, was found innocent, but moved schools.

Fast forward to more recent times. During the Obama-Romney election, ""my vagina has rights"" in regards to the pro-life / pro-choice issue. My friend, (let's call him Lawrence) objected stating that women has much more reproductive rights than men do in the US. As a outspoken feminist, Mary was visibly infuriated with this comment, and asked to speak to me in private. When we arrived at the kitchen, she asked how I could be friends with Lawrence, when I was so clearly a feminist as well (which was true at the time). 

I then told Mary the tale of how we first got together. I was living in the same dorm as Mary at the time. Lawrence and I were drinking playing Guitar Hero. I got heavily intoxicated to the point I could no longer play the game, Lawrence informed me to go upstairs where Mary was and to have sex with her. Next thing I know I'm pushed out of my room, and I slowly make it up to Mary's room, obviously heavily intoxicated. **I don't recall anything more of that night.** When I awoke, I was in my boxers, in bed with Mary, with a used condom on the floor. I woke her up, and she said yes. Sound familiar? Because I had no memory of this

Even if I were to say that I wanted to have sex with Mary, while she was completely sober. As I told her this, Mary stated that she was sorry I felt this way, and that I could file a police report if I deemed necessary. She defended her actions by saying that I wanted it, that when I woke up in the morning sober, I asked to have sex with her again.

Well that's weird. Of all the people that would understand the underlying reason why I would say that under those circumstances, I better have a memory of it so I could cherish it. That it was a good thing to happen to me. Because I am a man and I clearly couldn't be a victim of rape. And it finally occurred to me. Mary believed these very same thoughts I was trying to convince myself was true. She couldn't be the aggressor. How could she? She's the *woman*. He *wanted* it.

This is why I'm not a feminist anymore. In fact, not at all feeling remorse for her own actions as a rapist.

It's BULLSHIT.

1367385132.0,1dgrds,3 months after I found out my husband had been sexually abusing my daughter and the changes in her personality are becoming overwhelming.,AIbiTheRacistDragon,224,37,52,"Please forgive me for the wall of text. 

It is 12:16 am. I just managed to get my daughter to sleep after what felt like a two-hour roller coaster. Everything started off fine. She put on her pajamas by herself for the first time. She did her homework quicker than normal tonight

I was very proud of her, tonight was the night I lost my cool. After the first 30 minutes, where she refused to stop moving around, she reverted to playing with a toy. Tonight she picked a small plastic toy, the McDonald’s kind, and for the next twenty or so minutes she triggered the toys “open” button, and then closed it; on and off, on and off. I initially thought that if I where to lie down on my bed (perpendicular to hers) and stretched out my arm to rub her back she would calm down long enough to sleep. She revised my plans by grabbing my hand with her left, that’s how it felt, stretched

Ok… so we where still at this. I looked at the clock. 11:35. I have court tomorrow at 9:30 am, and I would need at least an hour to change her and get her ready for school aside from that. All in all, I calculate she should be waking up at 7am the latest, after all her daycare is almost 5 minutes away.  Knowing this I made the mistake of once again staying late at work so she could socialize with my co-workers. SCOFF you say!? Well, believe it or not she gets a kick out of it. She loves “mommy’s friends at work” they dote on her so, she is a princess there, and boy does it make it convenient for me. Why, however

I looked back at her, not only that but she’d been up since 6 am! She woke up yesterday all on her own to go pee at 6am and stayed up with me.  I was infuriated, but I knew I couldn’t show it. Her therapist told me to stick to positive reinforcement and screaming at her just won’t do. I have never been much of a screaming parent either, but my anger was rising and I knew I would be turning into my mother any second now. I told her to stop, “please put the toy down”, “it’s not playtime”, and “sleep time is just for sleeping”. Boy did she pick the wrong reaction for the wrong time. She sat up, and said “NO! You’re mean!” I struggled to calm myself, and of course it didn’t, blood-curling screams

I didn’t believe it before, and so entirely belittling, that a traumatic event like her father abusing her has left me so incapable of parenting, so incredible incompetent and pointless. I feel so weak, weaker than I’ve ever felt. My daughter wasn’t like this. She went from being a golden child in school to the problem kid; the one the teacher has to sit aside to get her to finish the class work, the one the teachers have to keep eyes in the back of their heads for. This isn’t encouraging any more. I thought I could do it, I thought I could be super mom, but I’m not. I’m nobody.

  She asked me to pretend to be daddy two days ago. At first I thought she wanted me to play with her dolls (we where driving) but as soon as I said “hey K.T.” with my best impression of a male voice

I can’t do this.

1361967609.0,19bna3,I need somebody.,theglumsleeper,208,25,64,"I experienced the most traumatic event of my life

I'm an insomniac, I was woken up by screaming in the next room from my sister. ""He's not waking up! He's not waking up! Baby, wake up!"" I lunged out of bed and ran into the room next door to find my older sister hysterical over her boyfriend who was blue and slumped in the bed.

By the time I got a good look at him, but was still warm. I began CPR on him, though not remembering everything I had been taught while in the heat of the moment (I went to vocational school for Public Safety).

There was no immediate response.

His lips were blue

I kept giving CPR but at that point, and I was still going with the CPR - occasionally administering rescue breaths.

I didn't piece it together at that moment: the problem.

My sister outright said, a bad choice on my part.

About two minutes into my CPR

The ambulance arrived at that point, and instead, was questioned about where the drugs were. My sister handed over the stash and finally a paramedic took over. At that time, I went out to comfort my family in the hallway while the cops stood around slack-jawed, not doing a damn thing with quite a few of the other first responders.

I was cradling my sister against the wall when I heard a familiar voice, the young man I had thought was definitely done and gone was up on his own two feet - helped up and out of the room. I told my sister to look up, just so she could see he was up and awake.

We spent about six hours in the hospital, for my sake).

By the time we returned from the hospital

Regardless, my stomach is in a knot. I spent most of the day throwing up and crying. I cannot get the visual of my sister's boyfriend (who I consider a good friend and a family member) blue and dead right before me. I cannot rest or fall asleep, I instead just want to keep checking in on the two to make sure he's there - alive, breathing, heart beating.

This is a rambled mess because of my scattered emotions at the moment. I'm so worried about so many things along with the fact that my brain just cannot process the fact that he was dead for at least three minutes and is now supposedly just fine.

I cannot talk to my family about it at the moment because we're all coping and those few trusted individuals that I have spoken to were of no help and just gave me generic answers. I'm hoping somebody here (not hoping, who actually has something that feels fruitful to tell me.

I first noticed I was attracted to children in early adolescence. It was in 8th grade that I realized the facial features and body structure of girls 5-12 were more aesthetically appealing to me than those of girls my age. I began masturbating exclusively to fantasies involving young girls at this time. I didn't put much thought into this

As I grew older and entered High School, egotistical, and superficial. My 2 attempts at getting a girlfriend failed miserably- there was no emotional or romantic connection between us whatsoever, and the relationships fell apart almost immediately. I fell into a deep depression, stopped interacting with my friends, and began spending most of my time on the Internet, playing online games and masturbating to preteen models. I felt deeply ashamed of my sexuality

When I was 17, curiosity, and sense of humor were absolutely intoxicating. Nothing made me happier than making her laugh and smile. I wanted no more out of life than to spend time with her and make her happy. Every waking moment was spent either thinking about her or being with her, and when I went to sleep, she would appear in my dreams. The sheer intensity of my attraction to her was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and it scared me, but I didn't know what to do. I would have sooner killed myself than ever cause her any harm- the idea of sexually abusing her was repulsive, by the way, but this was impossible. I've never seen two human beings cry as bitterly as we did on her last day at our house. As I watched her drive off into the distance

I turned 18 last week, they would fear and loathe me at best and disown me entirely at worst.  I can't look people in the eyes anymore. My entire life is a lie. I don't know if I can take this for much longer. 

In the past, but the only way to ensure they are gone for sure is to wipe or physically destroy my hard drive. My family is not very wealthy- we only have one computer and we can't afford a new HDD, but neither can I wipe it clean, as this would delete files necessary for my parents' occupation. 

Child pornography possession is punished with draconian prison sentences in the US. I would rather kill myself than spend years if not decades being beaten, and humiliated, away from my friends and family, and when it's over, be branded as a pervert and degenerate until the day I die. 

I can't look at a police car without feeling physically ill. Last week, men with assault rifles will break into our house and ruin my life forever. I often think about what I would do if that day finally comes. My father keeps a loaded gun in the attic in case of an emergency. Sometimes I put it in my mouth and taste it. I don't believe in a God or an afterlife, and I'm pretty sure that when you die, your consciousness simply disappears. I used to afraid of death. But there comes a point when the shame, self-loathing, and humiliation outweighs the fear. I know that if I ever get a knock on my door and hear ""FBI"", I will put the gun to my head and pull the trigger. 

And even if that day never comes, and shame. This is not a life I want to live. I wish I could change, but there is no cure.  I wouldn't wish this onto anybody. I love how the gun tastes in my mouth. One of these days, I'll finally get enough courage to shoot myself. Who knows... Maybe there is an afterlife.

I can't tell anyone this so I made a throwaway account. 

I spent the night at a friends house. I am 21. She and I got pretty drunk

I don't know what time it was but I woke up to a figure climbing in bed with me. I asked who it was and he told me. It was my friends boyfriend. I have been with the same man for 4 years. So I was very upset when her boyfriend climbed into the bed. I told him he was in the wrong room. I was drunk and I am very small

I'm going to go into detail because I feel like maybe it will help me get it out of my head. I cand stop thinking about the whole thing and I want to stop thinking about it

Anyways, but he is twice my size. During this he was holding me down with one hand and removing my underwear and pants. I screamed more before he stuffed my panties into my mouth. If I wasn't drunk I think I could have stopped this. I'm so pissed at myself. I feel like such trash. 

I tried to spit the panties out, then he let go of my hands and started choking me. I clawed at his arms but he kept choking me. I thought I was really going to die so I stopped fighting him. He told me I made a good choice and let go of my throat. I was so scared, I just gave up and I thought that if I just did what he wanted I would just be raped and I wouldn't die. I hate myself for this. I let him do what he wanted. 

He kept spitting in his hand and wiping it on me. He told me I wasn't wet enough

I thought it was over after that because he pulled out and came on me

I woke up at 8 am. I got my stuff and left. My friend texted me later and said she was sorry that she wasn't awake when I left. I told her it was fine. When I got home I took a shower and my boyfriend asked me what the hell happened to me

After he went to work I went to the clinic. I didn't tell them I was raped, and I agreed. Before this we used to have slightly kinky sex, but I told him I just wanted to have normal sex with lots of kissing and hugging. He thought it was weird, but I didn't want to deny him because he didn't do anything to me. I wanted to have sex so that if I am pregnant he won't think it's strange. I know that makes me a horrible person, but my rapist is Mexican and if I am pregnant I will get an abortion.

I can't tell my boyfriend. He has been cheated on in the past, I'll be labeled a whore. He told me that if I tell anyone he'll lie and say I came on to him. I don't want to report it so please don't tell me to.

Some background: I grew up in the Bible Belt. My entire family is quite religious (prayer before every meal, I never really thought about politics or anything. I actually voted McCain in 2008 without ever looking at a platform; I did it solely because I was raised Republican. Once I stopped going to religious things, I started thinking for myself. I started drinking and having challenging conversations. Then I started having these conversations whilst I was sober. I started hanging with different groups of people who had different ideologies than me. I began to see gay people as simply people; they no longer needing fixing. They were beautiful as they are. I began to think about how I can make a difference in the world. I started giving my time and money to help other people.

About a year ago I decided I was going to make an educated vote for this election. I started to look at the issues then think about my thoughts on them. After my research

In August, I really began to examine the American lifestyle. I heard what non-Americans had to say about us. I had insightful discussions with people with different backgrounds, religions, work ethics, political platforms.

It was depressing to hop back on Facebook and see things people posted in the pre-election days. I saw statuses saying that ""if you're a **true** Christian

So then Election Day rolls around. I saw stuff [like this](http://imgur.com/1WOVR) almost everywhere. I saw some of my ""friends"" call Obama the anti-Christ. I saw someone say that the rest of the world was laughing at us because we re-elected Obama (almost every person in my hostel was so excited about it, but they were also too fuckin' lazy to research some of the countries they wanted to move to (Canada and Australia are both more left-wing than the US, kids).

I was able to witness the Election from another country. A country that's across the world but cared more about my election than some of my American friends did. They were more knowledgeable about certain issues than myself. And for the first time in my life

I know this is really jumbled and probably makes no sense. But I needed to tell someone.

But he was more than happy to take from me over and over. I'm a giving person

I met you 8 months ago, when you started reeling off the answers to team trivia without any hesitation, that you sparked something in me. You were so fucking smart. So incredibly smart. But you were above me. I spent the next 6 months seeing you weekly with my group of friends for trivia, and occasionally out at the bars, thinking to myself that you were something incredibly fucking special. I avoided you at all costs, because I knew I wanted you. I was drawn to you, and it was terrifying. I loved my boyfriend, but I... was drawn to you. You made a few comments here and there that you felt I wasn't being treated properly by my boyfriend, after all.

2 months ago, and that I was not in the right state of mind and I was taken. You respected me and my relationship. We started studying together, we started talking casually, and I knew the spark I felt was... real. I fell way faster than I'll ever admit to you. All it took was my boyfriend failing to acknowledge our 2 year anniversary and I was finally able to walk away. I hated myself for hurting him, and you told me you knew I liked you but you weren't sure how you felt about me. You didn't consider me while I was taken, and now that I was single, you weren't sure.

I find out later that you've been burned. The only girl you've ever been with left her boyfriend for you, you... you took me out to the lake with a cheap bottle of wine. You don't even like wine, and make fun of me for drinking out of the bottle because it's not classy like you are. I'm not classy like you are. We sat on the frozen lake, and you told me you wanted to pursue this under the stars. You started taking me on dates. Buying me lunch. Doing dishes with me. Holding me. Actually putting your hands on me when we kiss, my last relationship had none of that. You're... attracted to me. You surprise me with coffee and my favorite ice cream. You hold my hand. You say sweet things and you're supporting in my ventures.

My whole entire life I struggled with loving myself. I still don't. But I came to terms with being a giver, who was nice to me, who loved me, and who took. Not intentionally, but just took because I was offering. I spent years coming to terms with that, and I finally did. I felt with my past, my sexual abuse and my scars, someone who treats me decently

And now you. I have tears in my eyes typing this. You're not real. This isn't. Real. I'm a loud, classy law student, family-oriented, extremely motivated and focused on your future to the point where you often don't have fun. And you adore me. You're drawn to me. I can feel it. You always want to be near me. To have a hand on me. To be holding me. You're ... excited to introduce me to your family and your friends. You're proud of me. You're proud to have me. You surprise me with things. You remember what I say. My favorites. My preferences. You not only accept me, you adore me and my quirks. I've known you for a while now, and since we started being us... you seem happier. I make you happy. This was never going to happen to me, not after everything I've been through. Pinch me. Fucking pinch me. I don't even want to quantify how happy I am. I continually feel like I'm going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be gone. Joke's on me. Boys like you don't like girls like me.

We were both in Houston for Christmas and I was supposed to see her the next day. I know she loved me very much and I'm not angry with her,,
1370452944.0,1fqdwg,Today I experienced the biggest shock in my entire life.,SonicFlatulence,191,26,19,"It happened at 3 am. I was asleep like everyone else in the house at this point in time. Suddenly I heard sounds coming from the master bedroom

Unfortunately, which gave me a clear view of what was going on.

My father just laid there on his side of the bed. He was neither breathing or moving. He was just… lifeless. My mother didn't stop to think for a single moment. Like me she immediately knew that this was very serious and possibly fatal. She started the CPR sequence right away and I called the emergency number.

I got hold of the emergency number right away and told them what happened. I emphasised that the situation was very urgent, but he just wasn't breathing enough to stay alive unaided.

The person on the other end of the line was very comforting and patient. I was totally stressing out as I was literally watching my father die. Just right in front of my eyes. He then told me an ambulance was near and on its way and requested me to put my phone on speaker so that he could give instructions to my mother. He also had to keep her calm because she was very close to the verge of panicking. After all

My mother instructed me to remove the pedestal cupboard from my fathers' side of the room. He was banging his head against it every time my mother performed CPR movements. It was a truly awful sight.

I was then instructed to clear a path for the paramedics that were soon arriving. I needed to open the front door and had to make sure they could find the place. I stood outside in front of my house wearing nothing other than boxers and trackpants. The adrenaline was rushing through my body so I didn't notice that it was actually really cold outside. Within a minute people arrived at the spot. At first they seemed lost in my neighbourhood

I didn't dare to go upstairs and come to think of it

In the meantime my brother had woken up. Actually he never went to sleep that night because he was working on a important school assignment. His bedroom is on the attic

I waited downstairs in the living room sitting down on the sofa. A police officer came in to comfort me and my mother and brother

After we helped the officer get the information

Then yet another traumatizing event took place in front of my eyes. I could clearly see the the hallway from where I was sitting. At a certain point I heard numerous footsteps slowly and carefully descending from the stairs. I could see the entire team of paramedics carrying a stretcher with my dad on it. He was being kept alive by several machines. This almost made me cry on sight

As my dad was brought to the hospital, but strongly discouraged us from doing so. We were in no condition to drive without getting ourselves in danger.

Thus, but it was no use. Everything was still so fresh in my mind, I couldn't possibly concentrate on anything else.

So me and my brother waited. And waited. It seemed like we waited for ages, as if it were forbidden to do so.

The ride on the subway train just took way too long. Of course we wanted to see our father as soon as possible

We arrived at the hospital

Apparently

The doctors kept on praising my mother and I for taking the right actions in such a short period of time. I don't really think I deserve the praise all that much; all credit must go to my mother and her first aid knowledge. We don't know much as of this moment

My father will be kept asleep for a couple of days. Nobody knows what he will be like once he wakes up. Only when he has returned to consciousness (and we're not even sure if he will) will we know what effect the heart attack has had on him and how severe the brain damage will be. For now I can only wait and let the professionals do what they're good at.

tl;dr. Dad had a heart attack last night. Traumatizing night ensues.

**Update 6-6**  
Thank you so much for the compassion

I had trouble sleeping tonight. I still cannot fully cope with the situation. Seeing my dad in such a position troubles my mind and it will keep on haunting my mind for a while.
  
I have paid another visit today, I'd totally do the same).
     
They are now busy bringing him back to his normal body temperature. Tomorrow morning they'll have him back at 37

**Update 7-6**  
I am pleased to announce that my dad is doing very well right now. 

In the morning he was feeling very uneasy and he tried to pull the tube out of his throat again. He had to be tied down to prevent him from succeeding.  

My mother

We were able to have a normal conversation with him. He was still feeling a bit groggy and sleepy because of the medication, what date it was and so on. All of these are great signs and reasons to assume the brain damage is limited.

The doctors confirmed he is indeed doing very well and he will soon (tomorrow if he's doing extremely well) be removed from the intensive care. Tomorrow I'll be paying him another visit to bring him some personal belongings and stuff to keep him busy.

**Update 8-6**  
He is recovering even quicker than I expected! I've read things about how long it takes for someone to recover from a heart attack and my dad is in fact doing so well that the doctors have now removed him from the intensive care.  

My brother and I paid him another visit today in his new room, but the other one could still be problematic. We don't know when he will receive treatment, but we hope it will be very soon. We don't want another night like tuesday.

We helped him with getting his tv to work, such as your name, date of birth, home address and even bank account number. He remembered all of those things perfectly. It seems as though that his recent memory has been lost; he couldn't remember what he did on tuesday or that we came to visit yesterday, but we're fine with that. It's perfectly normal for someone who has had a heart attack to lose memory of the day before the heart attack and the medication made sure he was still half asleep yesterday, so it's normal that he doesn't remember that as well.  

Initially we considered bringing him his e-reader and tablet pc, even in hospitals. He has tv now, so that's okay. We also brought him the book we bought him for his birthday. That will make sure he doesn't get too bored during his stay.

Not a lot will happen from now; now we're just waiting for dad to get back to strength so he can return home. This will still be a couple of days from now (apparently people who suffered a heart attack must be kept at the hospital for a minimum of ten days). I don't feel the need to update daily from now. I'd like to thank everyone again for the support and kind words and I'll let you know when dad gets home.

**Update 13-6**  
Dad got home today. He is relieved that he finally gets to sleep in his own bed again. He'll be under light supervision for a while and has to pay a monthly visit to a cardiologist. He also has to take a bucketload of pills every day. He doesn't mind all of that,False,,t5_2ranw,1371143056.0,,,t3_1fqdwg

""No! What if a dog bites you and you have to go to the hospital and get stitches?""

 Wow

Then he goes off on a rant telling me that I have to get my own car because he's tired of paying for me to use his car and his gas and his insurance (I'm not sure 16 year olds can get insurance by themselves, clothe, and educate your children, aren't you? That's surely not the job of a parent! Oh wait, that's exactly what your supposed to fucking do until I can take care of myself when I finish my education.

""All you kids do is sit around the house and play on your computers! You guys need to get jobs.""

""I have a job

I cannot stand hearing stories about men getting slapped with child support when they didn't want a kid in the first place. Yeah

I see a lot of this type of issue even within my own extended family. Females purposely trying to get pregnant for the perks - they don't want to work or hold a job

So here's my take on it. I'm all for the right for women to choose or not choose abortion. I, so will abortion. However, if they choose not to abort, I feel as though certain things should be taken into consideration. I feel as though the couple should discuss this well before sleeping together. If one in no way wants to have a child and the other seems to agree, but later ends up pregnant and wanting to keep it - the man should not be held responsible for child support. They made the whole ""no children"" thing quite clear.


I understand that this would probably not work well in real life. People can lie and say ""I told her I didn't want kids"" or ""we agreed that we would keep any children"" etc. *sigh* But I still can't help but think something should be done about it.

The closer I've been getting to this date, this appointment of my own making, the tighter the fear is wrapping myself against my lungs... the past couple days there have been minutes going by where the fear's had such a strong hold on me that I literally forgot to breathe.

The fear keeps telling me so many things.  It keeps telling me it would be easier not to go.  It's telling me that I can heal while I hide.  It tells me that the more I keep the world shut out, and that every risk I never took and every opportunity I threw away and every bridge that I burned was its safeguard -- its *gift* to me.  It tells me that I've hurt enough, I've paid any debts of pain I had several times over, it tells me that I *deserve* ""freedom"" from the terror of possibilities.  It tells me over and over, in every gentle voice and every full-throated scream within its power, that there's not one single fucking thing I can try to do in the outside world that will ever be *easier* to stay in here.

And it's *right*.  That's the best weapon against myself that my fear has ever had.  It does its share of lying to myself

As a good father and an encouraging mentor I need my four-year-old son to win sometimes.   His sister is a step ahead of him so far in most skills from sports and video games to eating efficiently and wiping and I need to remind him that he’s a BAMF without making her fake an inferior level of skill

So I do it.  I steer into the fences

And I’m pretty good at making it look like I’m doing my best.  He’s getting better at wondering why I’m doing so bad, but other than that there is nothing but gas and steering wheel.  I’ve attempted this, thinking that it will keep me right behind him.  I still inadvertently choose slightly more geometrically beneficial paths than he does (apparently) and I find myself BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.  I don’t mean to do it.  He’s just that bad.

And I know he’s got the genes of an MK Badass in him
How to teach him competitiveness AND honor?  How do I let him win but also teach him to strive for even more speed?  He’s already exhibiting pompous attitude traits at times.  You should see his face when he hits me with a blue shell.  It’s making me shake just thinking about it.

I love that little joker.  He’s my mini me.  He inhabits a place in my heart that even my little six-year-old princess (who has her own spot) couldn’t invade

But if I have to let him win one more time and see him shake his milk-white bottom in my face as he poorly imitates a victory dance he’s seen somewhere on tv or the internet

I hope that getting this off my chest will cool my jets enough to help me deal with getting 2nd through 8th place for another year or so

It just didn't seem like a way he would have chosen to live

While in coma, rarely smiling, but none of that happened. My life continued and I'm happy about his death because it was the only way he was released from all the pain he endured (he developed bed sores all over his body from being in bed). He no longer had to be in a nursing home where the fucking useless and heartless nurses wouldn't do shit for him,  nor have a poop bag on his stomach, a feeding tube, or a trachea tube.

1374942705.0,1j5zry,My five year old niece has just accused my father of molestation.,cmkwajoicvx,191,24,36,"Wall of text incoming

Let's start from the beginning. When I was younger, I don't really remember spending much time with him before I was about... 6? I remember he never did anything that straight up crossed the line, but he was always inappropriate. At 6, 7, he would let me watch the big sex scenes in movies, and even laugh at me when I would get embarrassed and hide my face or walk away. He would always go into his room to jack off to porn even though I would be leaving the next day and couldn't he just wait 12 hours? Even at that age I knew what he was doing. At night, I would sleep in his bed because I was afraid of windows at night, and get mad when I wouldn't. He would always talk about my mom

Then there was the picture. I didn't even remember anything about this picture until I was 14 and he showed it to me in a multipe-picture picture frame he kept in his closet. There I was, sitting in a big arm chair. You couldn't see anything in the picture due to a guitar on my lap, and a bunch of stuffed animals around me. But you could tell that I wasn't wearing clothes. I remember the guitar being cold, and wanting to put my clothes on. I don't, however, know if these are true memories, or memories that have been conjured up from seeing the picture.


When I found this picture, put me into therapy, and told me that she would cut off all ties with my father if I wished. I didn't want that either, as my two siblings frequently made the two of them speak and see each other. I got better, my mom and I's relationship grew significantly, and for I only spoke to my father when I absolutely had to.


Fast forward to now. I'm nineteen, but it's easy work and it pays better than any of my previous jobs. I just got the call 45 minutes ago that my niece had made molestation allegations against my dad, and that's why he wasn't at work Friday. I thought it was odd that he had texted me ""I'll love you more than you'll ever know"" on Friday, and I asked him if everything was okay. He said yes. He texted me again later saying ""I love you"" and I told him I loved him too.

I don't know what to think. It's all very complicated. The niece, high school, and got married. A few years out of high school and they've both gotten into doing pills a lot. The wife, who we'll call T, cheated on my brother with his best friend at the time. My brother was distraught. Got even worse into pills and other drugs. Started running with an even worse crowd, and eventually got arrested for multiple charges of burglary. I know that at some point he went on a drug run to Florida with a bunch of his friends to take care of some guy who owed them money. I have no idea what happened. He divorced T, and went into jail for two years. He starts a rehab program, and has been clean since jail. I am incredibly proud of him. T, etc. She went off and had a kid with the guy she cheated on my brother with. Then she gets caught stealing from some tobacco store. Goes into jail. After wanting nothing to do with my brother the entire time he's been going through all of this, every one of them. They all say the same thing over and over and over. Honestly

Three days ago


I honestly have no idea what to think, my father did some bad things but he never crossed that line. That also doesn't mean that he wouldn't with someone else, though. He saw A every week. She spent the night with him all the time, and she even has her own room at his house.
Would T just make these allegations come up? I don't know. She has known our family for so long

I could understand if you had EVER EVEN ONCE asked to watch TV or come in the living room and I had been a bitch and refuse or barred you entry. But the fact is I am not that sort of person and the living room is free for all in the house. You have never once expressed interest in anything except being in your room with the door shut.
So do NOT inform me when I walk in the door that you are making a schedule for who can use the living room and that I am expected to follow it. It's my house too and I will not be confined to my room. I will sit on the couch whenever I damn well please. IF a schedule for ANYTHING in the house is ever to be put into place I expect all residents of the house to have a say in it.

Mixing the whole no compliments thing with an almost non-existent sex life brought me to a few dark places in my life. I dunno, but they're just not interested in me. I'd pretty much resigned myself to being a life long bachelor because that's what my experiences thought me.

So, and there he is, complimenting me and what not. I've gotten more compliments in the 30 minute window than I had gotten up to that point in my life. I'd been doing a lot of self-improvement such as losing 30 pounds, dressing better, rebuilding my confidence and here was a guy that was complimenting me on all those facets of myself when all those around me hadn't noticed or hadn't cared and when I needed their support more than anything else. Some stranger was doing their job. 

Sadly, and that's what did it. No one had ever even said I was good looking, or cute, or even ugly, or anything, I just felt so removed from sexuality as a whole, and now BAM. Fucking awakening.

I need you to know the extent of the screaming, bleeding mess of a human being. For so long I was alone. It was terrible, but I was numb. The beatings didn't matter, the drunken molestation, being thrown from my home several times by the monster when I was just a kid, like elementary age, didn't matter. I was inside myself. Nothing could get through my wall. 

Everyone around me started dying. You were there to help lead me back from the nightmares where all I saw was him. Where he tortured me again and again. I lost my nerve. I was a wreck. But you were beside me. Regardless of your religious upbringing you started sleeping in my bed to keep me there. It drove your mother insane. She made me read the bible. So we ran away and you saved my life over and over....

But that's not what I'm here to talk about. 

I see him. I hear her. He's bloated and his veins are destroyed from the heroin. Her arms are still bleeding from the gouges she made with that knife. Why did I have to see that? Why did I have to go there? Why didn't I run away?

She was lying there on the bed

I really came here to explain. You need to know what still haunts me. You won't listen at home. You get frustrated with me because you see strength that I won't use, but I promise its not there.

I can't gather my thoughts anymore. I make simple mistakes because I can't remember or focus. There is just so much noise. First the whispering starts. Usually just before I'm fully awake. Then there is screaming and I'm terrified and all I want is for you to be here with me. Then there is me. The doubts

""I can't hear you sir

""... Its your fault. You're s disappointment and evil. You deserve how they treat you. You aren't a real person you're a monster.""

""Sir

Is my entire day. Because she won't shut up whispering, I can't help him anyway.

""I need the work order for mumbling jackass

Now you know, there is no peace. I think I'm supposed to go with them. I think they'll haunt me until I join them... Because its my fault they died. He couldn't take my pain, I shouldn't have taken it out on him... And she was innocent... She was just caught in the crossfire. She reminds me every day. I was over it, I know I can't control people, that their choices are their own to make regardless of my influence I never put that needle in his arm.

But why couldn't my mom just be on my side? Maybe she could help me. Maybe. They see me as weak. You saw. ""I worked harder and longer and had lore responsibility than you at a younger age than you are now!"" ""I work hard every day of my life!"" it doesn't matter that they don't work every single day of the week like I do for a minimum of 12 hours a day. It doesn't matter that I never have a day off, or that I get teased for being a man because I'm with you and I don't dress like a slut. It doesn't matter that randomly, out of the blue they will tell me that I my love doesn't matter. That I can't be engaged to you because our state won't allow it to go any further. I sit in shock and I want to cry because no one, ever, has loved someone as much as I love you. I try to vent, to feel better about it by getting that poison out of me.... But they tell me to suck it up. So I don't mention it. I don't talk. I sit on that office doing my work in silence. I'm going crazy.

All the while the screaming and the whispering and my own insecure mind ramblings get in the way of how I think and function.

""Where is she going why doesn't she ever tell me- please shut up it doesn't matter- I bet she's mad at me oh no she's going to tell our boss to fire me- so what

Why can't I just be confident again.

So you know why. You know now that I'm falling and falling and I can't catch my breath. But

Most of this was written when I was okay

Why am I such a chicken? They want me to go with them.

You were found behind a restaurant beachside with the alleycats.  You were different.  You were so skinny.  Someone had your front paws declawed.  You were a friendly, vocal, tuxedo boy and she took you home hoping to find your owners because there is no way anyone would have just thrown you out...


The reality was you weren't microchipped.  No one had 'lost you.  You wouldn't stop eating or drinking or peeing.  She realized something was wrong and brought you to the national chain vet clinic where my (former) best friend used to work.  I'm not sure who named you Phillip


Anyway, it was the sweetest cat in the world: you.


My (former) best friend, a sweet cat, a loving cat.  But nobody wants a diabetic cat.


Her life fell apart.  Drugs and bad relationships.  Against my advice


I've gotten over my fear of needles.  But I've had no choice.  I've given you shots 2-3 times a day since she left you here.  You get the cheap wet food just as often.  I told her I couldn't afford to keep you.  But every month I spend another $50 for food, syringes.  $50 is a lot of money when you have next to nothing.  And I would be lying if I said I didn't resent you and her (to a much much greater extent) because of this.


Living in the garage is not ideal.  I fucking know that.  You're a good boy.  You never complained.  You would sing when it was dinner time.  You would yowl to greet me when I was getting my grumpy coffee in the morning.  When I was petting you and you wanted more time, and bartered and given more than I could to give you more time...


I tried to find you a home.  Craigslist doesn't want a diabetic cat.  The bitch at the humane society flat out refused in the worst


I spoke with so many people from so many different no-kill shelters and non-profits.  ""I'm sorry.  We can't take a special needs cat.  The economy is so bad we can't even adopt out the kittens we have.""  But the real salt in the wound was the day that three people from one of the no kill shelters (yeah, spay/neuter, give shots to AND adopt out SEVEN fucking cats.  But they didn't have enough room in their hearts to give you a better chance than I could.  Fucking hypocrites had enough money and resources to take care of SEVEN feral cats.  But the sweetest diabetic cat in the world was sneered at.  Yes, sweetie, they sneered down their noses when I asked.  I still feel sick thinking about it.  It makes me so angry.


A year ago, i couldn't find you in the morning.  When I finally found your limp body in the cubby an hour after breakfast time, you were hot.  You were almost unconscious and you were not lucid.  Your blood sugar was above 600!!!  I gave you water 1mL at a time through a dropper.  I made a slurry out of fancy feast and gave it to you mL by mL.   I have stacks of paper.  Notes from the 6 weeks of my life I devoted to yours mL by mL, one test strip, one lancet, one unit at a time.  Bits of a life, drops of devotion, I gave to you.


While you were sick


I estimated your weight.  I did some math.  I crushed up half a pill into a fine powder.  I added an exact amount of water.  I'd shake it up and give you a syringe full by mouth twice a day.  One day, white concoction.  It was the only time you ever hurt me.  You scratched me with your hind claws as you tried to get traction to escape the antibiotics.  You were like a scrambling jackrabbit and I wasn't mad.  I cried tears of joy because it meant my dapper happy tuxedo boy was better.  And you were!  You cried for food, and caught my leg, and gave me moon eyes again.  And in the blink of an eye, another year passed.


I got sick.  I caught croup from the babies I watch two weeks ago.  You are so patient with them even though they scare you with their screeches of delight.  Even when they are rough, you never bat at them, you just let them experience the joy and warmth and love of their first kitty and for that, I am grateful.  But it makes everything so much more difficult.


You, you have loved those who helped and fed you.  You even loved me unconditionally when I was terrible person and ignored your want of love and affection because I was bitter with life.  If things were different, if you hadn't just been left in the garage with a house full of asthmatics who are extremely allergic to cats, if we had wanted you as much as you wanted us to, if we had the money for our medical care and yours...


But things aren't different.  We've tried and tried and tried to find you a home and no one wanted you.  No one wanted a diabetic cat.  No one even wanted to give you a chance.  If you were *only* a cat, tears clouded my vision because diabetes clouded theirs.


It looks like your last home will be the garage.  You're sick again.  You waited until I had caught croup and couldn't breathe.  I was too feverish to notice until earlier today.  It looks like you've thrown up almost everything you've eaten for the last two days.  You started losing weight a couple weeks ago.  It wasn't your insulin.  I don't know what is going on


I don't have the money for a vet.  I don't have the time to be your angel again.  I have two amoxicillin left, you lived for me.  Right now, you are in the garage.  He won't let me bring you in the house and keep you in the bathroom until your appointment on Thursday.  Maybe tomorrow night he will, but for now, i can't and I'm sorry but it isn't fucking fair.


I'm letting you down Mr. Kitty.  I'll give you water with the insulin syringe I busted the tip off of.  I'll try to find some way to give you food.  I'll hold you and pet you and try to keep you comfortable as much as I can.  But on Thursday, best cat in the world.  But the truth is, no one in this world wants a diabetic cat...and the one person who really wants you can't afford to keep you anymore.

I just needed to say this to someone, 

1. she may not remember and saying it will spark the memories causing her to cry and tell mom and dad with best case scenario they kick me out and disown me with me having no place to go ( I deserve it but honestly don't want it ).

While I agree that racism, I struggle to think that it is only outside influences or people causing people to be in the position they are. 

I say this because some of my friends friends go to all black colleges or are part of black only interest groups and fraternities. But why? Why do you fight so hard for integration when you end up segmenting yourself out of your own will by race? 

Or why is it that over 90% of murders are Blacks killing other Blacks but Zimmerman

And when issues of education or opportunity are brought up

I guess my main issue is that I recognize racism is still around but I believe it is not as big of an issue as it used to be. I almost feel like by focusing so much on racism and constantly bringing it up

Even the man I was in love with (not the dad) gave up on me because I had kids.  I know of a women who had an older son that has autism. Very similar to my son. She said she put him in a facility that could cater to his special needs

Tl;dr: didn't want to be a mom. Now I'm a single mother for two kids with autism. May look into putting autistic son in a facility where they can manage his need. Looking for a relationship but not in a rush 

Edit: I'm overwhelmed by how many people even read my 3:00am rant. It's amazing you can all relate and gave me sound advise. I'm not sure what I need to do from this point on. But all I know is something has to give soon. 
Quick note: my parents are elderly and can not accommodate my children. My ex has a very bad drug problem and doesn't take them often (I won't let him) 
He once forgot to pick up the kids from school because he was so high. I received a phone call that everyone had vacated the school grounds and my kids were not picked up. I went and got them immediately. When I went to his house to check on him he informed me that the kids were in his living room playing. (they were in my car). When he realized they were still at school he freaked out. I told him to never attempt to pick them up at school again. He is paying child support now. But that is all about he is up to date with.

Fuck you

What exactly is it that you do? I know that you lurk around our office like you think you are important

You float into meetings you aren't invited to and steal the extra lunches. Fuck you for that. I take those extra lunches downstairs to the interns, whose entire paycheck (nearly) goes to pay for medical treatment for his disabled child.Fuck you for taking their lunches when you make triple their salaries. What in the hell are you even doing at the meetings? You have been told repeatedly that you aren't to invite yourself to them but you still do. 

Our CEO is a man who loves to hand out second chances to you because you did that one spectacular thing 7 years ago when you first started. OMG, Alan. One fucking job. 

How dare you go into my office and log on to my computer when I wasn't there. You don't think I know. I do. Fuck you. You don't even work in my building. You work in the office across town. Why in the hell are you even over here? You didn't think I would reported you to HR

I recently got a lock installed on my office door. Good luck getting in now. What the hell were you looking for anyway? 

Also

Coming back after maternity leave to 200-something emails from you was wonderful. I didn't answer them because you don't need that information. It isn't even your job to know that information. 

Fuck you

Also, look! Cake!"". Fuck you, Alan. I was pregnant and I was going to eat that cake. I said one piece, Alan. Not the whole rest of the cake.  

You really hurt Noah's feelings when you made fun of the way he speaks. He has a fucking speech impediment
   
Tomorrow you have a review with the Board and the CEO to determine whether the department you run is up to standards. I hope you fail. It sickens me to think that because the jobs of the individuals with disabilities who work at your location depends on your success

I will dance, and finally fire you.

You are the only thing I hate about my job.

Thank you. I don't think you realize how much these last two years have meant to me. I came to this class at first expecting to just go over material and read boring stories, laughed the most, and loved the most. It's the place I found myself the most comfortable, and around the people I could call friends. I don't know how you did it. You made me actually want to wake up and come to school in the morning. You gave me something to be excited about. I don't know what made you such an amazing teacher. Maybe it was the way you respected us back. Maybe it was how you talked so passionately about your job. Or maybe it was because we didn't only see you as someone who passed out assignments, and controlled us when we got loud, but as an actual person. You were someone who cared about more than homework. You actually cared about us, too. There were good moments, but I would do it all again in a heartbeat. It's so astounding to me that I may never walk into that classroom again, a doctor, and I like that person that I've become.

  A year ago this summer

  When my sister was 12 (yes, many pictures of his cock (I've seen them), while she in turn sent him lude pictures that I, as a 21 year old in a serious relationship, wouldn't dream of doing myself.  

I saw a picture of my twelve year old little sister with a banana shoved up her butthole.  I'm talking hundreds of fucking pictures.  Not only that, she constantly talked (bragged, even?) about ""trying to kill herself"", cutting herself, making herself throw up, all that.  And he egged it on.

He invited her out to California, or if it's gotten lost in the sea of small town police incompetence).  After that, my sister had to be checked into a mental hospital because she was hysterical and threatening suicide.  I saw my dad cry for the first time, and in the ensuing months my parents got a divorce.

Apparently, a bunch of pro-ana websites, and had multiple ""boyfriends"" she'd sext and send pictures with.  Over a year later, my family is in shambles and my little sister has spent 10 days in rehab for multiple issues.

My little sister hates me, and I know I shouldn't, but every time I think of my dad breaking down and crying or that goddamn banana, I hate her with so much heat and pain I feel like I'm gonna lose it.  I've been to therapy and it was bullshit.  I'm already on meds for other issues and I don't want any more.  My family has completely fallen apart and I can't help but blame her.

  Well, thanks for reading.

UPDATE: My sister is in regular therapy, seems like a nice guy)...I'm not sure how much he knows about her problems but I'm hoping that this turns out to be a good thing.

As for our relationship, so it's a start.  I still only see her about once a month when I visit from college, but from what I can tell things are on a very slow climb.

When I graduated college I couldn't find a job in my desired field right away so I took a sales job that had a low salary but good benefits. After 10 months they fired me for not making my sales goals despite having higher numbers than my actual manager. I hated the job so I felt relived really. I thought this would give me a chance to go and do what I really wanted to do. 

I got a bunch of interviews and got 2 job offers! I accepted the one where I liked the people better and paid a lot more, move, and be ready before my first day. 

Now, they knew the business was growing and wanted to bring me on board anyway. I knew I wasn't going to make as much as the experienced person they hired but I was also going to be given less responsibility and more training. 

After 2 days of training I go in on my third day and get called into the conference room. They tell me that I'm not a fit and that it isn't working out. That I am going to require a lot of training and they don't have the resources or the personnel to train me the right way and that it wouldn't be fair to me to keep me on.

She fell for a coworker of hers. She was 18, begged, if she could be with him. He always said no, because he wasn’t of our religious background. 

So she brought him to church. He accepted our beliefs (for her) and became a member of our church. After a while, my sister and this boy continued to date each other under the guise of being “just friends.” This went on for two years. My younger sister and I both knew what was going on, and to be honest, we were 100 percent happy for her and loved the guy. 

My sister graduated from college, although their relationship was still a secret from my parents. Although a couple living together before marriage is against our religion, I felt happy for her. By all technical religious standards it was wrong, but I never felt that way. A day before my birthday, my parents went to help her move a couch into her apartment. My mom went snooping through my sister’s dresser and found “incriminating evidence” that her boyfriend was living with her. 

All hell broke loose. They forced my sister into their car, locked her back in her room, and wouldn’t let me talk to her until several hours later.

My sister was weeping. She told me that my parents had given her an ultimatum, she chose us over him. I remember sitting on her bed, with her crying in my arms, and telling her the hardest thing I’ve ever said: she had to choose him. I knew she would never be happy otherwise. A few minutes later, she picked herself up and walked downstairs. She locked herself in the bathroom with her phone and called him to come pick her up. My dad broke down the door to get inside so he could take her phone away. He hurt her. He tried to physically restrain her. He wrenched the phone out of her hand, but it was too late. She left.

I was told that I could never speak to my sister again. For 6 months, emailing her, texting her. I maintained my relationship with her, and I believe I did the right thing, even if the Bible says to honor your father and mother.  

Since I wasn’t allowed to attend the wedding, my father called me and let me know that I could speak to my sister again, and that it was my choice of what kind of relationship I wanted to have with her. My mom and my younger sister barely speak to her. My dad refuses any kind of contact with her at all.

Since then, and I hold my head up high.

I love my big sister and brother-in-law with all my heart. 

Edit: First of all, my dad apparently believes that his daughters are under his rules and standards until they are married, regardless of whether they live in our home or not. I did not know he thought that until all of this went down. My dad and I barely speak at all anymore. I still live at home. I'm a full-time student, and I'm working hard to get out on my own. I've been playing it safe ever since this happened. Held a few relationships (not with anyone my parents would approve of), but as you can imagine, this whole situation tends to scare off guys pretty fast. I'm not going to go any further than saying that my religion is a ""Christian"" denomination, but the standards my dad has for our family are much more strict than the views my church holds, but I believe in a God who loves

And so instead of honoring my decision to stay out of the dating pool for a while

1) This Six Flags adventure was never mentioned to me and I never agreed to do this.  I don't like crowds and I have high anxiety. Plus

2) You can't just DEMAND a person go out with you and force them into a strange position like this. Now I have to turn him down a second time and I look like an asshole because he purchased these tickets. 

3) When did ""No means no"" start meaning ""No means maybe?""

I'm pretty angry.  He's already called 6 times today.  I told him last week that I didn't want to date him or see him again because I don't have feelings for him and I don't want to date people.

I don't understand if he missed the boat on that whole conversation (which was done in person) or if he's fucking psychotic.


Leaning towards psychotic. He's being intrusive.

EDIT: So brainfucked

DOUBLE EDIT: THANK YOU for your kind words! Seriously, and told him to never contact me again.  I think he drove past my house earlier today - saw his Nissan going around our cal-de-sac, and that was a little terrifying, but I think I'm okay for now. Thank you.

Four long years of my life. Blood on the sheets. Drinking beer, trying to swan dive off of porches piss drunk, to break my face, as you laughed. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen, you decided I was too fat and asked out a seventeen year old beauty queen. I ate ninety tylenol in another state once I found out who she was, couldn't take it. I went back to you as soon as I got out of the hospital and a month later you went to another high school-aged girl. Beautiful. Thin. I let it happen. We were okay for awhile after she dumped you. You still threw me out of your moving truck and made fun of me with your friends, but it worked. I ignored it. I drank it all away.

I was in love with the idea of you. So scared to let it go

Everything's okay.

You cheated on me casually. Told me openly that you didn't respect me. The fights in your truck when I dodged your blows.

Everything is okay.

I started to make friends and do things. I met a girl at a club who got me to model. I realized that maybe I didn't need to stop eating after all. I could be beautiful.

You did it again. This time the girl was fat. Isn't that amazing? You like women looking like your (adopted

I left the night you tried to kill me. After

After that it ended. Painfully. I don't want to talk about that anymore.

Soon after I found someone who called me beautiful and smart

When you heard I was pregnant you demanded a dna test. You wanted the baby to be yours

You lied to me.

You put a twisted idea of what sex is supposed to be like in my head. I HATE you for molding me into a porn star. Sex is not exhibition. (At least I give amazing head to my fiance, you fucking bastard.) I feel like I was a prostitute who is making love for the first time now that youre gone. I guess I was your prostitute for four years, wasn't I?

I hate you. I hate you. Most of all, and the fear drives me to irrational craziness. Little fights make me remember your abuse, your drunken verbal tirades. I run. I want to run from him and I don't even know I do it until it is done. But he always brings me home and wipes my tears. Makes me think about what I'm doing. I'm getting better. But you've made it so I can't handle shit.

I want to teach my daughter all about scum like you, scarred shell. I will protect her from shitbags like you with education. And I will help her if she gets herself caught. I know what it's like. 

But that's all in the future. Baby girl is one year old tomorrow, but it's only been two years. I think I'll forget your name eventually.

I'm normally a chill person so I don't feel too upset about waiting for Harry and the nanny.


Finally Harry and the nanny show up at around 5:25. Before I can even begin the lesson


Now, I'M THE ONE WHO GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE. I SHOULD BE THE ONE SCREAMING AND CRYING."" But I'm not this kid's mom and he obviously doesn't know any better. So I remain calm and tell Harry that he should apologize since hitting people isn't nice. Nope. He crawls under the table and continues the classy act of screaming and crying (while throwing pencils at me). The nanny is smart and stays out of the whole mess.


Finally mom comes home and I tell her what happened. By this point, same deal. No reprimands, no apologies, nothing.

I am a schizophrenic. There are many different types of schizophrenia, the protagonist's schizophrenia is strikingly similar to my own. 

My hallucinations are a combination of visual, tactile, and gustatory. Basically all 5 senses. I hallucinate people who are as real to me as anyone else, they have minds of their own, thoughts on their own. I cannot control them. The only reason I know that they don't ""really"" exist is if others can't see them or if they give of some distinct signs. Think Fight Club without the body switching. In some ways I feel like she's the Hobbes to my Calvin, except she's not a tiger. Now that you know the nature of my disorder, I'll tell you a story.

When I was 15, it tore me apart. Eventually I came to terms with it. We became fast friends. 2 years past, other hallucinations came and went, either disappearing without warning or ""killed"" directly by me. Some of them were dangerous, they could hurt me. She was the only one that stayed.

I started to spend more and more of my free time with this girl, although I think I win on this front. She was also smart, charming, funny, and above all, an optimist. She was different than me in a lot of ways. We fit each other's holes well. 

I started to fall in love with her. Could you blame me, if she caused my weak spot for red heads, or if I was falling for her in part because of her red hair. We started to talk about relationships. She of course didn't know many boys, and she was paranoid, very scared of people. So me being practically the only guy she knew (she had known other hallucinations, and had been around people that lived at my house) she started to have mutual feelings for me. I didn't know this yet. (FYI I had already had a ex-girlfriend by this point) 

We started to fool around with each other. I'd get her off

-----

I grew up dirt poor, with red hair and freckles. My mother was physically and emotionally abusive, and my father did nothing to stop it. I was in the school district's gifted program, and was a dedicated, first-chair musician in a top-tier junior high band. In short, I was a prime target for bullying.

By late middle school, three bullies cornered me behind the English classrooms and discovered these two facts in what proved to be a humbling disaster for them. That victory earned me a little respect, even if it also earned me a severe beating at home for fighting at school.

Through the rest of seventh grade, I began to grow out of any ""pudginess."" My success with music further built confidence.  

A summer of hauling hay bought me some nicer clothes for the beginning of ninth grade. The popular girls still ignored me

My ninth grade year I took second hour as a ""band monitor:"" basically running errands for the band directors

That same year, worked as ""office monitor"" during second hour, collecting attendance slips from classrooms in the main building. She too developed a routine route, one which happened to cross mine in the stairs. 

Sue was the ""queen of the school:"" A physician's daughter, and dressed in the latest fashions. I was so far below her caste I didn't even dare make eye contact with her passing in the stairs.

One morning, ""Hi, FloatingIntheStyx,"" in passing. I was struck speechless, and just kept walking. I was breathless at the same time. Dumbfounded. Blown away. Sue said,""Hi?"" She knows my name? She knows my name!

She said hello again the next morning, and Homecoming was approaching at the end of the week. While we talked about who was taking who to the homecoming dance, I surprised myself and asked who she was going with. She said no one, and then we moved on with our days.

I spent the rest of my day arguing with myself, and I called her. I had convinced myself I was just as good as any other boy at that school, and foolishly, asked to take her to the dance. She was gracious and gentle when she rejected the offer, simply stating she was going out of town for the weekend instead of going to the dance. 

I knew it was a lie, and walked around to the front where everyone waited until time to go in.

As I rounded the corner,"" pointing and laughing. ""You ask *Sue _____* to the dance?!?""

I quickly retreated around the corner away from everyone. The rest of that day is blacked from my memory, tears streaming down my face. I was beyond even trying to hide my face in shame anymore by seventh hour.

I remember one boy, ""Everyone gets rejected, man. Its gonna be alright."" I replied that is wasn't the rejection. I didn't care about that. I had been fine with that. It was being a laughing stock for believing I was their peer, for thinking myself worthy enough to even *ask* Sue to the dance 

Even the classmates who realized they had hurt me could not comprehend the damage they had done. Everything my mother so often told me, that I would never amount to anything, was all confirmed with resounding clarity as I rounded that corner that morning. All confidence I had built was utterly destroyed. All trust I had in anyone was shattered.  That light of hope that had started to shine in my life, that I was just as good as anyone else, was snuffed out. 

I was nearly catatonic for days, my classmates moved on and forgot about it. Like a malicious driver who swerves to hit an animal, only looking back to make sure they hit it, they sped on with their lives while I wallowed in pain waiting to die. 

I don't want to stretch this out longer than it already is, and it took 10 years to reach something of a normal life.

What they don't realize is that having depression means that you feel like there's something on your shoulder. The size depends on your level of depression, that thing is evil. It perches on your shoulders and digs its claws into you. It hovers close to your ear and whispers godawful things. It tries to convince you of all the horrible things in your life to make you feel lower than dirt. It tries to make you hurt yourself.

Depression isn't just a mental battle against that shadow. The sadness is so powerful it literally feels like a weight is pressing down on you. Your head and shoulders hang from the weight of it

If something triggers that depression when you're feeling bad already - forget it. That sorrow hits you like a ton of bricks and leaves you speechless. The entire world falls out from under your feet and you're left with that damnable *thing* laughing in the back of your head. Everything stops. And everything hurts. 
Your chest compresses

You forget to breathe. You forget to blink. And all you want to do is let it swallow you up one last time to make it stop because you know *damn* well no one can get you out of this. 

If you suffer, friends, a lover...whatever it is, I hope that one day you can find your light and let it lead you up to the surface. And when you do you better not let yourself lose it. Once its gone, you fall harder than ever and by god, you had better have some beautiful, hidden strength within because it will destroy you inside and out.

That’s what I was raised to be. 

Follow directions. Don’t ask questions. Mom is suffering

Go to your room.

We don’t like what you do

You don’t apply yourself. You could do better. You’re just lazy. 

Your grades are not good. We will take things away from you. Things you love.

Somehow I came out all wrong. Not sure how I did that


We move from our home, and everything I know. The new place is dry, hot, and dusty. There are crows and snakes and coyotes. Blowing dust and heat. I leaned the sickly sweet smell of a rotting animal carcass on the way to the bus stop. My new friends aren’t like my old friends. They teach me dirty words. They play “humping” with me.

School starts. Somehow

They don’t like the pictures I draw, or to pity me because it’s so sad.

Sent to the principal’s office. I’ve done something wrong again. I don’t remember what he said

He lifts me up by my shirt collar

They put me back into 3rd grade from 4th. It’s a big deal because they don’t usually put kids into lower grades from upper grades. I must be really bad.

They put me into 2nd grade for a week. I’m embarrassed. Then 1st for a week. I’m embarrassed. 

Then I go to Kindergarten for a week. I love it. I am the first one done with the school work. Finally time for me to shine. We play games. This is easy

I’m in the office getting swats. The ones from the principal hurt. The ones from my mom don’t. I feel sorry for her because she’s not making the impact she wanted. The pizza paddle from the kitchen drawer isn’t doing the job she hoped it would.

In 5th grade, second highest in math. The kids turn to look at me in disbelief. 

New principal


My family moves again

1977. Star Wars. I never knew I could feel this way. I didn’t understand how I was like Luke

All you ever do is play with those stupid toys. You spend all your money on those Star Wars Figures. Why is it always Star Wars with you? 

Somehow I’ve got it wrong again

Mom

How about Dungeons &amp; Dragons? No. It’s satanic.

Can I play drums? No

You’re getting perfect attendance award this year. You’re dressing in these clothes. No shorts

Come home from school, but it’s probably one of those. The fire department’s number is taped under the phone. I call. They come. The volunteers come and mingle and talk. Blue jeans and fire helmets. They take her away. There’s nothing I can do to help. There’s nothing I can do to fix it.

But hey. I can do what I want today. I can eat what I want, no one is telling me I’m wrong.

We go out for ice cream, is all I say. They go look for themselves. They freak out on me. They’re angry with me again, but there’s nothing I could have done. 


The high school kid next door showed me something weird today.  I never knew a penis could do that. He’s bugging me to “do it” with him again. I like his electric car track. He says he’ll let me play with it if we “do it”. I don’t really want to but he’s bigger than me

What if I pee in your mouth? 

Then he’ll spit it back out at you. 

He takes me out to the camper shell. The smell of dusty carpet and old vinyl and the feel of someone’s warm skin on mine. The Playboy magazines he gave me are on the couch when mom comes home from the hospital. I wasn’t careful enough. 

What’s wrong with you? Grounded again. 

I find a Polaroid picture of a man’s penis on the side of the road. I’ve never seen something like this. It interests me. I take it home. They find it in my room. They look at me with accusatory eyes. I make up something. They let the matter drop. If I lie

You always lie

I find a new type of magazine on the side of the road. It’s not just boobs. It’s people having sex. Sometimes lots of people

I hide it in the dirt in the back yard. No one can know. It makes me feel something good


We move again. New school, and despair. 

I have no control over any of this. They expect me to know things. They test me

Toward the end

A week later

The only time I cry is when I call the pastor and mom’s best friend. My voice cracks. I hang up and go back to where I don’t cry.  

It’s a brilliant summer evening. I’m free. Is it wrong to feel this way? I drive her car home from the hospital

Years pass. Advancements in education. I tell my dad that if they had these when I was a kid, or ADHD, or Dyslexic. Put me in a special class. I don’t care. Just help me understand. 

He says

No

It’s been years since we talked. He said we could get together as long as we don’t talk about his feelings or my feelings or anyone’s feelings. 

FUCK HIM! GODDAMNED MOTHER FUCKER! FUCK HIM! 	

I can’t think about him without being angry. I finally know what the phrase “seeing red” means. I think about him and I can’t even see straight. I want to rage, like I’ve cried. I want him to die miserable, like how I’ve lived. I want him to understand what he did to me. I want him to own up to his mistakes. He was the lazy one. He didn’t “apply” himself. But he never got grounded. I did. How can I force him connect with me in a way he can’t ignore? 

I find myself hating other people who are happy, and raising children. I hate them because they don’t know how hard it’s been for me. I hate people who tell me not to be depressed. 

But I sit back and think (and know)
Nobody can know.

If I tell people my feelings

When people leave, where they don’t love me anymore.

That’s why I don’t believe in God anymore. Because there’s always a place I can go that’s beyond his ability to love me. If he loved me, and not wait for me to love him first. 

Fuck god.

I’m alone. No family

I was detained by the police yesterday.  It was a case of mistaken identity, and cuffed.  It was made clear to me that I was being detained, not arrested.  I remained calm and cooperative, knowing I had done nothing wrong.  After running my ID, checking with several witnesses, and talking to me directly, the officer concluded that I was not the man they were looking for.  I gave him the description of a guy I had seen running nearby moments before it all went down.  He apologized, and asked if I had shit myself when I saw the dog all fired up.  He also offered me a ride to work.  All in all

What's annoying me is everyone else's reaction to this.  Half my friends and family are set on storming the police station in a rage, and are constantly discussing what could have gone wrong (you hear those stories all the time, people get shot! Etc).  I can't seem to get it through to them that because of how I reacted, I wasn't in danger and ended up only slightly inconvenienced.  The police acted professionally, they were searching for a violent criminal and reacted as such.  They were appreciative of my cooperation and treated me fairly the whole time.  This is exactly how I would expect law enforcement to behave and operate, and bear them no ill-will for any of it.  So why does everybody else?",,,,

I loved her like family. She was one of a few people, and spoke freely and frankly. She understood me like no others did. When others saw a misfit troublemaker who refused to go to school, she saw independence and intelligence. As corny as it is, she believed in me when I could not.

Forgive me in advace if the formatting is weird or whatever. Also for grammar and spelling


Backstory:
19 year old female
I graduated class of 2012 and at the time I knew I'd never be able to afford college. I can't get loans because my parents have poor credit and can't co-sign. Can't get financial aid because my father makes too much money. So naturally I was looking into joining the military. Specifically the Navy. At the time I was with my boyfriend of almost two years.
 Because of past issues, so she of all people understood my want and need to move out of my father's house. Around the time I was graduating sis found out she was pregnant. With her being 3 years my senior, living in a two bedroom apartment that she couldn't afford with her jobless SO, we decided that it would be a win win situation for me to move in. 
NOTE! I'm a good kid! I don't do drugs, and rarely now) and i got good grades (graduated with honors) had a job and money saved for a car. So, moving in was a mature decision that we talked about thoroughly!
Fast forward three months and I'm going though the worst time of my life. Boyfriend left me, I'm incredibly angry ALL THE TIME. Very hard to live with. We finally argue about the way I'm treating her, and I promise to try and do better, which I did. 
Fast forward to January-ish. I'm still in a bad place
Fast forward again to March!
I'm actually happy at this point in my life! Still hate my job, and I want an actual career! 
I talk to a friend that just graduated from her Air Force A school. I'm motivated

 Long story short, 4 years reserves. The shortest contract you can sign) and have my assigned rate (job). I'm extremely pleased with my decision, and am expecting my family to be proud of me! 
I call my mom up, okay."" 
My sister, and isn't really pleased. 
My mom and I have a huge fight about it, at the time, AF tuition assistance was being cut) She's also using her brand new baby girl to guilt trip me, Saying that I'll never get to see her because I'll be so far away, etc. So, I'm completely baffled at this point. The only people that are happy for me are my father and his wife. 

TL;DR: Joined Navy after a week of chatting with a recruiter, we make up. 


So my sister and I make up, I decided to stalk a little and found out that it was my sister. No big deal, mostly pictures of my niece and normal comments. 

Well then I noticed she'd posted on r/offmychest. I know she's been having some problems with her boyfriend, kind of getting that ""I'm reading her diary"" feeling while doing so, expecting to see a rant about her very unmotivated baby-daddy boyfriend. 

Boy
It was all about me and how my decision was completely childish and how I'm making the biggest mistake of my life. And. It. Was. Mean. I quote: ""She's so angsty

I'm so hurt by this. Even though I discovered it about a month ago
1.) I want my niece to be proud of me! I want to be someone for her to look up to! Not some uneducated fast food worker! I KNOW I will miss out on a part of her life
2.) I want to be a college graduate
3.) I've always wanted to travel, but I plan on saving quite a bit of money for traveling the globe when my years are up. The Navy has many was to help you save!


She thinks: "" You are only looking at the positive side of everything, because when they do there will be no way out, and you'll be all alone somewhere far away from home.""
I do see the negatives

There are so many more reasons

I guess the point of this is just to say that it really hurt me to see her say those things. It legitimately struck me to the core to read her post. Even though I think we're past her feeling this way

Anyone else a single dad? I have 3 kids. 2 live with me, when she was 6 months old and I haven't seen her in so long. Child support can't track her down and supposedly doesn't work or claim benefits given no federal agency has her details. I am a student, completing my degree in teaching. Had to quit my career as an IT manager because I cannot raise an autistic son by myself working the long hours my career demanded. I had to choose between my career or my boys. I chose my boys.

So I'm on unemployment benefits. My car has died and I need to get another. I applied for a few loans only to be rejected for all of them. Really odd as I haven't been rejected in the past, those rejections get listed as a ""check"" on my account and all the mainstream banks don't like those. So the credit agency tells me to remove them, I need to get an affadavit, file a police report and a few other things.

In the meantime, therapy costs, etc. Do you know what my local charity said? They can't help me because I could easily get work. Bull-FUCKING-shit. I told them that while it is true, the only work I can get is out in the city, 80 minutes away and my autistic son keeps falling sick and until I can sort all that out, I can't get a job as I end up taking a few days off a fortnight to care for him. Then a single mum walks in with her kids, shows HER pension card (I did too mind you) and was immediately given a food hamper, clothes for her two girls and a gift card for the local supermarket. Meanwhile I've got my youngest in the pram

I'm so sick of this bullshit. This area has great support if you're a single mum. The council provides for you. THey will pay for daycare so you can have a day out, I was asked to leave because the mums all felt uncomfortable even though I was just sitting and playing with all the kids there, along with my 3yo whom was crying because he didn't want to leave.

This is fucking bullshit. Charity won't help me because I'm a dad. Banks won't help me because my credit has been ruined by a vindictive ex but while I work on fixing it, am threatening.

I'm going to go drink for a bit...

I come from a poor family and my dad is a somewhat failed businessman. He guilt trapped me into starting a small supermarket kind of shop with the money.

It started making a loss and didn't break even until after a year when again he told me that it was going so well (when we had barely just broke even) that we needed another branch.

I've told one person about this, not my dad's - slowly opening. I watched you as this happened and it scared me. I saw you draw your last true breath of life and your eye - it was glued on me. I knew instantly that you had gone.

My sister-in-law frantically woke my brother up and I got up from my seat and ran to my dad and hugged him tight with tears in my eyes. I felt like a child - I'm 20 years old and I felt like a child who just had a bad dream

My brother tried to convince us that you hadn't passed for a minute or so

When the doctor came in to confirm you had passed, who bawled harder than I feel like I ever have. I hugged him tight and let him cry into my shirt as I stared at you. My brother and sister-in-law were crying on the other side of the room. My cousin was near them, doing the same. Nobody was looking at you. I couldn't help it.

You lost color so fast. By the time we left, if anyone, who knows how to be truly still. I feel like it is only something the dead can master, after a life of constantly moving.

A life of constantly moving is what you showed me when I was growing up. I remember my powerhouse mom who never seemed to rest, but truthfully you were a lot better than other moms I had seen. Even after you couldn't work anymore, you still pushed yourself to the limit.

I always thought I would see you live until you were in your 90s or something. Cancer has a way of changing things. Changing life expectancy, who needed someone to care for her. You couldn't care for us anymore and I know you hated it, but within this last year you just decided to accept it. 

I think that's how I knew you were going - my endlessly stubborn mother accepted her limitations and stopped trying to go above and beyond them.

I spoke at your services. Anyone who wasn't crying started after I began to speak. I didn't have a speech or any big words to say

Dad tried to speak, I was just focusing on not dropping the tissue box I was holding for everyone.

I'm doing my best to be strong for everyone. Everyone keeps telling me that if I need anything

It's only when I'm alone that I feel like I need something, doing anything - walking around, sitting, **breathing**. I will never hear your true voice again - all I have is the voice recorded on my phone in a video of us driving down the highway at nighttime, while I tried to catch a video of what looked like a meteor falling from the sky. You laughed in the video. I can't see you in it, but I have that laugh and that voice.

I'm going to get a tattoo of your handwriting soon. You didn't agree with it, if you weren't born with it, it probably shouldn't be on your body"" - I have two prominent scars on my face and I think they add character. If one day I lose all of my possessions, especially those linking me to you, at least I'll have this. I'll always have some part of you. That means the world to me.

I miss your voice. I miss your smile. I miss your strength. I miss your warmth.

I miss you and I will for the rest of my life.",,t5_2ranw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/w6dck/mom/

He knows I'm gay btw.,Throwaway-offmychest,150,31,18,"So last spring I came out to him and my mom.  They're very hardcore, and that being gay is not the sin but rather gay sex, but I've just not decided to talk about it with them.  The only two people who I can discuss the issue freely with are my therapist and my aunt who lives in New York and is a lot more open-minded about these kinds of things.  Meanwhile my dad gets up in the pulpit about every other Sunday to talk about how homosexuality is a blight on our nation and how God will judge us for it.  I'm not kidding.

My dad was in the army and befriended a man. I'll call him Will. Will was also a teacher at my middle school. He and my dad were good buddies, and we fished and played in the water. It was all innocent fun. I was around 11 or 12 at the time. 

One weekend, Will asked me to sit on his lap. I didn't think anything of it, I had no idea what his intentions were. He grabbed my shoulders and began to massage me, telling me ""I have too much tension."" My dad always (innocently) rubbed my back, so again I didn't think it was anything weird. Then I remember him grabbing me a certain way and spreading my legs. 

I felt his hand under me, as if he knew. I remember jumping off of his lap and going to lay down in bed. I didn't know what to think, but it freaked me out. He left me alone, and that was that.

He continued to be my teacher for the next few years and we just acted like all was well. He would come by to ask to take me with his kids to go swimming, and so everything had changed. 

My dad was always one to act like his friends could do no wrong. He is a very hard man to get along with. I never had the heart to tell my mother because she had been sexually abused throughout her entire childhood. She hated the topic. I also felt somehow

I've suffer from borderline personality disorder, it has eaten at me for years. The fact that Will had a daughter, and he was a teacher. It happened around 13-14 years ago and I've always felt like I just shouldn't tell. I didn't want to go through something bad. I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but now that I'm grown I know that his actions were very wrong. 

What are my options? Thanks for reading.

I have little privacy around here. I'm not allowed to have a lock on my bedroom door, especially if there's pads in there. I am an adult at 19 but he refuses to treat me as anything but a spoiled kid who needs a good beating to make her compliant. If I am sick in the car, he screams at me which makes the pain in my stomach worse which makes him scream more. He knows that I am ill, has to take me to many specialist appointments and has seen me in pain lots of times but still insists that I am ""lazy"" and tells me ""hurry up and get better, go get a job and get out my fucking house"" (""his"" house that the government owns). He sits watching tv all day and accuses me of being lazy even though he doesn't do shit and it's mostly left to me and my mother to do the housework. All he does is sweat and fart on everything and leaves crumbs everywhere then accuse us of doing nothing. 

I want to have friends but I don't want them to meet the disgusting fat fuck and see what an asshole he is to me. When we're in public, at 19, not to ""wander off"" as if I am a young child at the zoo. I only got to go out on my own last year and he ripped my handbag apart trying to pull it off me so I had to go home. He treats my mother like a servant. She has to do everything for him, including making sure he eats every 3 hours because he's probably too lazy to make his own food and actually takes his food to him because he refuses to eat at the table like an adult. He wants to sit in his armchair with a tray on his lap and sit there eating his food like a toddler in a high chair. He always refers to us as ""that one up there"" when he's angry at us (depending which one of us he's decided to get angry at) and if my mother tries to point out I did nothing wrong he starts verbally abusing her and saying ""oh stop fucking defending her, never mind that she is your child, stop defending her"", etc. I feel more like a verbal punching bag for him to take out his insecurities on than i do his daughter and I'm sure my mother feels more like his slave than his wife.

1356791322.0,15mi4h,Something that has been with me since I was fifteen.,UsifRenegade,153,34,26,"This may be long; but It's something that has been with me for a long time.

It all began when I was about fifteen or so; just shortly after I had broken up with my then girlfriend. We were dating for about a year or so, getting closer to a friend of mine.

The break up hurt, her actual intentions, and just that it was merely for reputation purposes. 

That same day after school, why it had to be me, you know, the usual fifteen year old dramas; that is, until I was approached by a young lady wearing a long sleeved shirt in the middle of summer (In Australia).

Her name was *Jessica*.

She approached me, with dark brown eyes, smiling at me, with genuine interest in my story, and in me. I proceeded to tell her the situation, and the lead up to it all; and with every line I spoke, she absorbed.

We talked, at which point she just said to me *""at least you're still alive, at least you still have family. You have your whole life ahead of you, what does it matter if she used you? Better it was only a year, rather than four""*

At this point, with what felt like the warmest smile I've ever been given.

We continued to talk for another hour, where we went to school, and what not. By now it was nearly 6 PM, at which point she told me she had to go home. Before leaving she grabbed my mobile and quickly put her number in and told me to call her later that night, at about 11 PM.


As she left, but rather the fact that someone, a stranger took their time to listen to me, smile for me, and just genuinely care for me.

11 PM rolled by, and talked some more; getting to know her and life, present and past. This kept going on till about 7 AM; till we both realised we needed to be at school in an hour.

I sat all day in school just thinking about her, just from the bottom of her heart. I was excited to just talk to her at this point, literally having *butterflies* in my stomach thinking about it all.

This kept up for months on end, to the point I didn't see. I soon found out she was extremely abused as a child and even present day, with her father being a drinker and taking out his anger on her, whilst her mother just sat by, pretending it never happened, basically blocking it all out.

I was also approached later on

I wont deny that she fell for this excuse, there is only one thing on a guys mind, and they'll do most anything to get it.

Though this rumours existed about her; I didn't care... I kind of promised myself I'll be that guy to love her, even getting to the point where she would be asleep and he would just walk in and start hitting her, forcing her to run.

There would be times where I would get phone calls at 3 AM telling me to come out if I could, I would see her sitting on the ledge, with her school bag on the floor (she still wanted to attend school, usually waiting till 8 AM for it to start).

We would sit there for hours, and even sometimes *""What you reckon we are going to do with our lives? Reckon there is more to life than all this?""*

I was just a kid; I didn't know how to respond, and for the most part; that's all she wanted to hear, smiling back at me.

This continued for another month

*""Yousif
I know I promised you we'd get through it all together, and that meant the world to me.
Will see each other someday soon


My heart dropped, no one was home and I had to climb up to her room, only to be too late. She was already pale, and lying on the floor... There was a suicide note written to her family, apologising for her not being the daughter they wanted, or being perfect in their eyes.

It burned me inside knowing, not even a bit. I took the note and ran, and continue running.

I found out a month later her family moved away after burying her

It was her that made me a better person

*I do remember you Jess... Even in my mid- twenties... You're the one constant in my life*.

I had to get it off my chest, and nothing comes close to it.

I made it into college the next day, to discover I had gotten a 70 on my last assignment- that's an A, where I'm from. I felt a bit deadly. 

On top of this, I hurt- but no bitterness. I walk away with only good memories and no unresolved conflicts.

Some rear padding shows that you are well-fed and healthy. A good waist to hip ratio indicates that you are fertile and likely will have an easier time giving birth. Humans find anything that indicates health and/or fertility sexy for obvious reasons.

I lost a child

I scared my children.  They didn't get to see me for a few months.  I made my wife understand how bad of a person I was.  My poor son screams whenever I leave thinking I might not come back.

I got out of prison, and get a degree, online.  I started out doing really good, kicking ass and taking names.  Then I slowed down.  I wasn't motivated.  My wife was working, when I should be.  I promised her she would never need to work again before we lost our baby.

So, and I hate it.  I hate doing laundry, I hate doing dishes.  Every day I need to make breakfast lunch and dinner for a family of 5.  I'm vacuuming, and folding laundry, when I should be working, and providing more food, and more stability to our children.

My children suffer because of my lack of attention.  I get mad at the little things that I should be laughing at.  I notice I get mad.  When I worked, and it wasn't that great.

But, like making the bed, or make a dinner that is not home cooked, like frozen pizza.  I'm trying to be a better person, and a better father.  It's just so hard, when you have so little.  When you've fucked up so much, it feels like it's impossible to come back from it.

Now, intelligent, kind individuals. If you are part of that group, you are excused from the following. To the rest of you:

Thank you for making what has the potential to be one of the best websites on the internet a fucking haven for some of the worst people and ideas on the web. There is a certain

First and for most, crime, or even simply somebody ""not that intelligent""(Honey Boo Boo?) comes up, somebody posts something along the lines of ""man, we should really sterilize these people so they can't reproduce"". Every other week it seems somebody is posting a manifesto about the need for social Darwinism and how ""idiots"" shouldn't be allowed to reproduce, or how doctors shouldn't save people's lives, or how the movie Idiocracy is sooooo accurate

It's fucking pathetic. First of all, and we will continue to do well. Get the fuck off your high horse. Secondly, **Do you have no empathy**? When you preach for these things like Eugenics, you are preaching for a higher power to step in and take away one of the most basic rights of life, the right to reproduce. These people that would be effected by Eugenics are your friends, your relatives, your neighbors, human beings. They have feelings and emotions and faults

Another thing that really irritates me about this website is the overt racism. A huge part of Reddit just straight up hates black people. Never mind the literally hundreds of studies that show that the leading factor in crime is socioeconomics, and hundreds of other brilliant visionaries,  nope, black people are bad. A common argument I see against this is ""I don't hate black people, I hate niggers"". That is arguably the most ignorant fucking statement that has ever been made, and shows just how engrained the doublethink is for some people; that statement boils down to ""Hey, I'm okay with black people

Even worse than the racism is the blatant homophobia. Reddit has a weird relationship with gays; it absolutely loves them when their rights are in conflict with religion, not to mention the more overt discrimination. And guys, we get it. Reposts are annoying as fuck. But saying ""OP is a fag"" is neither funny nor original, or even effective. Leave that shit on 4chan where it belongs. 

Reddit has a weird love hate relationship with women. On one hand, 2x, and thousands of users have pointed out, Reddit is a terribly sexist place, making literally thousands of sexist comments a day. On the other hand, Reddit seems to have a never ending stock of ""nice guys"" who bitch and moan so much about how unfair it is that women don't love them for just existing, and how all women are bitches that only like assholes, Reddit is like a 13 year old boy who can't stop cracking ""make me a sandwich"" jokes

Ultimately, but absolutely lack anything resembling social skills, so they sit in their basement and bitch and moan about how hard their life is, while simultaneously wallowing in their own narcissism, going on about how awesome they are and how everybody else is so dumb and how it's totally bullshit that everything doesn't just fall into their lap. If this sounds like you, new flash: **The world doesn't fucking work like that**. If you want anything good to happen to you, you have to go get it. Nobody will do it for you. The rest of us figured that out by the end of high school

To anybody who is reading this and gets mad, hard look at yourself. Because I am talking about you. This website has so much potential to be fucking amazing. But it is absolutely over run with these people. The neckbeard stereotype is alive and well on Reddit, and it really, really hurts the kind of discussions we can have on here.

I haven't told anyone in my personal life this because it seems like a stigma to bear (being a virgin at 23). I had been in the ballpark before, when I reached 20-21, I was always too embarrassed to tell anyone I was a virgin, so I never let it get that far. Sometimes I broke up with people very early into the 'relationship' because I didn't want to tell them that I was a virgin.

I realize now that I was young and naive, sucking me in deeper and deeper).

I ended up going on a trip overseas where I stayed with one of my best friends who lived in that country. I met her roommate, and when we got back to their flat he asked me to come to bed with him. 

Because I was far from home and away from pretty much everyone I knew

It was a great night. I was with someone I found attractive, completely okay with me. 

I needed to get this off my chest because I'm not embarrassed about it. Now I am capable of getting into meaningful relationships without worrying about my ""V card"". I definitely don't do one-night stands because I am now confident enough to know that that's not the type of sexual encounter I want. But I made the right decision for me and I am happy with it. :)

This summer, meaning the only expenses I really have are gas and lunch money. 

I called my grandmother/former guardian to tell her of my plans before the summer started. Her reaction caught me off guard, he refused to talk to me for weeks and I didn't see him for two months afterwards. 

I came home two days ago for the first time after moving in for a coming home/4th of July party (my cousin came home safely after being in the USMC for 5 years). My father had apparently told my family of me living with my boyfriend, favorite aunt and uncle, a cousin or two, and my two infant twin siblings. Everyone else either came over to say hi, then left immediately and avoided me, or simply didn't say anything at all.

Here's why I'm pissed off.

Out of the 6 of us female cousins (including myself), given financial help, had huge baby showers thrown for them, and were given a place to stay if they needed it. Only one of the four cousins actually knows who the baby's father is, and he no longer has custody after smoking meth in the car with the baby. 

One of the cousins that had a child is pregnant with her second child, due any day now, and my family couldn't be happier. 

So why is it okay that all my cousins are becoming young mothers with no job, and no baby daddy around, but it's not okay for me to live with my committed boyfriend to have a good job? My boyfriend works 50 hours a week at a reliable job, takes college classes online, has a nice car, and pays for all of his bills himself. He's an all-around good guy which my family is obviously overlooking. I'm sure my family would be okay with my cousins living with their baby daddies, right? It really makes no sense for them to criticize me for putting myself in a good situation and doing something that would help me find a job after I graduate. 

tl;dr - Family criticizes me for living with my boyfriend to have a great job to put on my resume, money, or baby daddy in the picture.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Recently we found out she has terminal cancer. Because money is tight, and even raised money for her to get there. I couldn't have been happier. I asked a few times about specific details, but she said she doesn't know much, since it was so last minute (which I can understand). She was always very vague, which kind of threw me off, but I didn't think anything of it because I was watching her become a vegetable in front of my eyes. 

She wasn't allowed to use her cell phone in there (which I know is true), and she said there was some sort of hepatitis scare there, and everyone had to get tested for all sorts of things. She came back positive for both herpes 1 and 2. We BOTH got tested before we ever got together, and neither of us had anything. She said that I should go get tested. I just found it really odd, so I decided to look at the headers of the e-mail to find out where they are coming from. 

They are coming from a state (state B) a few states away from where she should be (state A)

Shortly before all this happened, from what I remember, is state B. I WILL say that I could be completely off on where he lives now, and want to believe it is state B.

I'm at a loss now. I have no idea what to do to confirm it. I know I won't get an answer from her if I directly ask, she could be sneaking it (she has before when she was in the hospital). 

I don't want to confront her, if I confront her and she is there, she might lose hope on living. The one person she wants in life thinks she is cheating, instead of being at a clinical trial. I love her to pieces, but I'm so lost right now.

Yes, died. 

Yes

I do genuinely feel bad for the people died

That being said, and so he swears vengeance and racks up a pretty hefty body count.

That’s sort of what this seems like to me. Except this is real. Would you justify those actions if it really happened? 

The “war on terror” has turned us (as a whole) into a hateful shithole of xenophobic, or too often used as justification for stupid bullshit. Like, honestly?

I realize that for the people who lost family

Honestly. 

All this does is show people that by killing a few Americans on the homefront you can destabilize the entire social structure of the country. I realize that asking people not to care is a bit silly, we shouldn’t still be angry about it as a whole 12 years later. A national tragedy for us is a daily occurrence for people in other countries.

I don’t think that people “waking the hell up” is an issue

This reverence for our military is just bullshit. Memorial day was recently, a job. And one they get paid pretty handsomely to do. Yeah, it’s a shitty job that I don’t want to do but if I recall correctively (this is said entirely in jest because I know for a fact) a lot of people sign up happily to do it (except for those poor people who got drafted into Vietnam, ANOTHER CROCK OF SHIT). 

Thanks for doing it so I don’t get drafted

There is no reason for us to still function in such a way. Such a fucking racist and hateful way. And if you’re still reading this, and how willing to justify the suffering and murder of more than 3000 innocent people because some American lives were lost. Just because some jackasses in turbans flew a pair of airplanes into three thousand people doesn’t mean that we, as a country, get to go on some ridiculous revenge quest. We destroy innocent people’s homes and lives over some “catastrophe.“ It’s just not okay.

So we gave my doggy half that. He started to not eat. They thought he was getting picky. He started getting lethargic. They thought it was because he is old. Then he started to not whine or bark or wag his tail or eat unless forced. They looked the drug up online. They found out that when he started to not eat they should have stopped and have him checked out because that means he was being poisoned. 

He died around the same time all the other reports of dogs dying on this drug did. 2 weeks later.

1354163565.0,13z6i4,A question my mother asked me the other day about my pregnancy gave me insight into the reason behind her treatment of my brother. ,Moshpity,114,8,26,"My mom said ""Can I ask you something? Why are you so happy to have a boy? Usually moms get excited about girls""

A little back story, thinking she'd want to see them. After I showed her the outfits she asked the question above. Now I admit after two years of dresses and ruffles we are excited to buy ""little man clothes"" but not any more excited than we were buying tutus and headbands for our firstborn. Newborn baby clothes are adorable and we're excited to be expecting our second child, just as we were with our first.

Honestly, if I'm able to have patience with my daughter because I had anger problems in my teens, why i hadnt lost all the baby weight at 16 weeks post-partum, etc. So her asking such an odd question did not throw me off much until I started wondering why she would think mothers are only happy about girls. When I was pregnant with my daughter she suddenly began texting me every day, which was odd considering we'd only talked two or three times a year for the previous 6 years. With this pregnancy she doesn't ask about anything and she just generally seems less excited, which doesn't bother me but after her question I started thinking about that too. 

I was her firstborn, so she also had a girl first, then a boy. When my brother was two she left him with his abusive father because ""it was the only way he'd let me leave""  according to her, even though she left my far more abusive father when I was 2 and disappeared so he couldn't find us. Anyway, after she left my brother and sister's father we didn't see our brother for 5 or 6 years. She knew where he was, but made no attempt to see him. My moms boyfriend finally pushed her to get visitation rights when my brother was 7 or 8 and we would pick him up every other weekend or less often if my mom didnt feel like making the hour drive, which happened a lot. When my brother was around 16 he got into drugs and started breaking into houses and was also stealing from us, except our little sister who stayed with our mom. 

It was another 5 years before I could get in contact with my brother again and my mother refused to talk to him at first. Now she makes no effort to be in contact with him, but now im wondering how does she just not care about one male child while constantly declaring on facebook her love for her two female children? My sister is her mini me so that bond is understandable but my mother and I had a holidays and birthdays type of communication for years during and after my teens and we're still not close. Our relationship as it is now only exists because of my daughter. I guess it just bothers me to think that the reason she was able to leave him so easily is because she really didnt care that much.

I used to be huge.


When I say that, I still accept full responsibility. Throughout my entire middle school/high school career, I overate and was sedentary. Maybe not 450 pounds worth of overeating and sedentariness (that's not a word), but I certainly did myself no favors.

Obesity is a huge concern for health. It's a terrible state to be in for health and psychological reasons


Don't let this happen to you. People will judge you. They will put on fronts


The weird part? I don't blame them (except the bullies


As horrible as that sounds, this is enough evidence. Despite not BLAMING these people, I do NOT condone their actions. Life is hell for a larger person. I know I hated myself after a certain point, and we don't need your loathing on top of our own. 



Enough about the preachy stuff, to a degree. Then it hit me: I could change. I could fix this. I began working out, despite the fact that it exhausted me beyond reason. I ate healthier (not perfectly, but who is) and limited my intake. Over the two years since I began these habits, I have gradually improved my diet to where I intake roughly 1500 calories a day, drinking almost exclusively water. I also work out 4-6 days a week. 


I am still 300 pounds. I have worked my ass off (hehe, with no intention of stopping. The difference in how people treat me, even from 450-300, is astounding. I have always had confidence in social interactions, but now people will actually RESPOND to me. I still have 0 luck with women (22 year old virgin with no actual experience beyond getting emotionally close to several women) but that will come in time. It's simply frustrating to be assumed that I am a lazy slob because I was in the past.



The post rambles, yes, but devaluing human beings is not the way to help them. People fuck up. We are human. I fully support healthy habits and weight loss, but don't be a dick. It doesn't help. Some of us are even doing all we can, I promise. Just, go out and try and be supportive, unless they just refuse to change. To anyone who took the time to read this, but thank you. Stay classy.

I try to talk to my aunt about what happened. She tells me it wasn't real rape. My father questions whether or not I know for certain it happened. I give up on ever turning to my family for support. Nobody believes me. 


Around this time my husband and I meet. After he gains my trust through some flashback issues and sobbing-nights I tell him everything. For the first time in my life, and he gets frustrated. He tells me to go to a therapist, but what if they don't believe me? We fight. I can't look at him for days. We don't touch each other for months. I get better, we are fine for a few more months, rinse and repeat. It is a vicious cycle and I know that I need help, but my whole life I have been having nightmares and flashbacks...


My own mother doesn't believe me. My father doesn't believe me. I never told my siblings and everybody in my family has just labeled me the emotional loon. 


I know I need help. I'm just terrified about it. According to my aunt this sort of thing is impossible, or I've just got the definition of 'rape' mixed up with some other word that represents forced, non-consenting sex. The kid who did it, he's grown up now, just like I am. I don't know if it bothers him like it bothers me. He's probably in college now. He's probably happy. I'm just confused, angry and scared. 


This whole thing came out choppy. I have rewritten it about three times because I don't really want to offend anyone. I don't want to waste anyone's time with this, or no one will respond and it is just something I'll be able to pull up in my history every once in a while. This is the whole point of joining reddit right now. I've been working up the courage to do this. I needed to tell my story, and even though this isn't the way I wanted it to be told...I need to do it. I wish someone would believe me. I wish people didn't think I was lying because I PROMISE I'm telling the truth. This really did happen to me. I wish it didn't. I don't know who would make this kind of thing up but someone who is sick and twisted...


Like I said

Here's the thing...  Our relationship has been slowly slipping to shit for the last ten years.  We've been married for 19, you seem to think ""you'll get over it"" when I have a legitimate gripe is an acceptable response, and you really just don't seem to give two fucks for me anyway.  Then, in February, you mentioned divorce.  Not me, you.  I've been willing to try to work on this shithole of a marriage for the last decade, but you... You said it.  You said the 'D' word.  I was devestated.  And then what happens?  You get cancer. 

Yeah.  So, and I'm now essentially a single dad with two kids.  And here's the kicker. 

I'm not leaving.  Your cancer is stage 4b, you'd already be dead.  So I'm not leaving.  I'm not backing out, leaving you to die, leaving my children, or any of it.  You know why?

Because I still love you.  God damn me to hell for it, even after you browbeat me, call me down in public, take sides against me, scream at me, and basically treat me like garbage, I'm still here.  And you know what the silly thing is?

Yeah. So I lost a cousin in the Newtown shooting. It was incredibly rough. I live abroad and couldn't afford to fly home on such short notice, while these issues are still pretty raw and the source of a lot of hurt, they are not what is contributing to my current upset.

Over the last couple months, i.e. lifetime gun owners who are actually pro gun legislation reform in the light of their six-year-old getting murdered. Who'd have fucking thought, right?

Some of my family members have received accusatory letters from crazy people

It's one thing to see these people getting made fun of on the internet

I feel so powerless to stop it, they cross the boundary from being acceptable to being outright hurtful.

The parents of the girl who was killed are doing as well as can be expected. They are kind, because they understand that the Lanza family are victims too.

The conspiracy theorists are causing me to question the state of the world more so than the shooting did.

To make matters worse, right? :(

There have been so many angry confrontations both online and off that I've lost track of how many people have disowned him or accused him of being a mental case. Which he is. He did a few too many drugs for a few too many years

My family are good people. They are not liars. They are not attention seekers. They did not ASK for the media to document every waking moment of their lives. They did not ask to become pawns being jerked about and made examples of in equal amounts by politicians on both the left and right.

We just want to grieve like normal people. Please

When you imply that the murders were staged or that the children who were killed were killed by Obama's goon squad, dehumanizing our grief, telling us that our feelings are not valid.

I hate the fact that this is something I even have to defend against. I'm tired of being angry all the time.

I don't know who to talk to about this.  My ""friends"" make horrible comments about my girlfriend for being a different race.  Now, you know?  If I find you attractive, or fun to be around, what is on the outside has no bearing on my emotions.  It hurts so much that people I have known for a large portion of my life would be so disrespectful and hurtful, especially when I get really serious with them and tell them to shut the fuck up.  Ignoring it is like being taunted by school kids while your mouth is gagged.

I casually mentioned something, ignorant mind is enough to drive any decent human towards an uncontrollable urge to break his fat ugly virgin face.  Yes, he's a virgin, and most likely because he's such a tool, but anyway, moving on... When I mentioned this very censored thing the kid had said, she didn't say anything at all.  I had a phone call so I answered it, half the surface area of her cheeks were glazed over with tear drop leftovers.

I instantly knew I mentioned something I shouldn't have.  After I assured her that nobodies opinion of us or her could convince me or sway me into changing my feelings for her

...Seriously?  Are you fucking serious?  I date a black girl, so you have no right to talk"", that is such fucking garbage and you know it.  You can't fucking sit there and try to minimize what you're saying to me by lying and trying to convince others of some uber farce.  It is absolutely horrendous.  I can't believe I call you children my friends, and I can't believe I ever even considered you my friends.  You're all overweight, desperate, and willing to bring anybody else down to your level so you don't feel so sad by yourselves.

I'm coming to a point in my life where I just can't stand the childish behaviors my friends engage in.  I'm going on 25 years old, I have no friends here.  I have the same friends as I did back home, the same friends I game with consistently.  I just wish I had a steady group of friends in real life to help take me away from these herbs I still call my friends.

The police started to go through my iPod

My iPod didn't have anything on that had to do with the stuff i was getting in trouble for

For the past few months, so i would message these people and trade them, porn for porn. I would mostly message other guys and trade them my stash for their stash, and i slowly accumulated around 200 pictures. It became less and less about getting something to fap to and more about getting more pictures because i was bored, and that was something to do.I only ever asked for pictures of girls my age, and i would tell the few fucked up pedos who sent me pictures of 8 year olds to fuck off.

While 85% of the pictures were probably not even underage pictures, which would be the 8 year old pictures that i never saved, but are in my conversations that i deleted which would be saved in some cache in the messaging app's severs, and i few pictures i got directly from some 15 year old girls (i never sent nudes of myself though), which i did save but never traded to anybody else.

The police quickly found the pictures--which i had in an invisible folder (jailbroken iPod, and they went through every. FUCKING. PICTURE....right in front of me.

The whole time the were making comments like ""Wow, they just don't end"". When they finished going through everything, they took my phone and iPod as evidence and i left. After that they went to my house and searched it (like i said, they overreacted), found nothing, and took my computer as evidence (which had nothing bad on it).

Since then, etc.), but the through this whole thing i was just waiting for the child porn issue to come up. The police haven't charged me with anything relating to the porn yet, so my parents don't even know yet.

I was scared when my mom wanted to get our stuff back, my parents would pursue it until she figured out why they were keeping them.

My mom got my computer back, i know they can still charge me for ""possessing"" them, and having those is a much worse crime than having the pictures of the teenagers. I know they can put me in juvie for a bit, and i don't even care about that because it won't be on my record because i'm under 16 and still a minor. It's knowing that they can put me on the sex offender registry that scares me.

I know what i did was wrong, and now i can have my entire life taken away from me for that.

I'm not sure if my family will understand. People at school will find out. I won't be able to get a job. Terrible assumptions will be made about me. I'll be targeted and attacked by people who find out and(understandably) don't like sex offenders.

Please don't just tell me that what i did is wrong and horrible, but i just really needed to get that off my chest because i don't have anybody who i want to know about this that would understand.

To add to that, no peers to call my own and now no fucking dating prospects. It's like White guys have fucked with me all of my life and now Asian women are joining in on the fun. I hate feeling this way but every Asian female White male couple I see is more proof to me of who inadequate Asian guys are. 

You know what though? I'd probably be okay with it but every fucking white guy talks about how easy it is to bang asian chicks with that self satisfied smirk then in the next breath says its because we're tiny dick losers. They speak as if they're doing asian girls a favor by rescuing them from the shame of having to date an Asian. I would be okay with it if they weren't so fucking **smug** and racist about it and if Asian girls weren't so shameless about it

If your car is just a rolling chassis, If its not running and needs a bunch of shit, Put it in the Parts category, also no, I don't want to spend 1100 dollars on your rolling CRX Chassis that has been spray canned black and has no interior.Its not fucking worth that dude, seriously.

I know it's devastating to lose a baby, she can't have any more kids, and the husband would be a widower and would have a tough time moving on and the kid would probably feel guilty growing up. If the baby dies, yes it is very sad, but the mother has had so many experiences and is ready for more that it would be a waste to choose the baby over the mother.

 You talked about the kids. 

 I came back

 It's been a year now.

  It's not much better.  

Here's the thing.  You are supposed to be an adult.  You're almost 40.  I am tired of taking care of you.  I have had my struggles and my disappointments

  I am sorry we have debts.  I am sorry we have bills.  I am sorry I screwed up the taxes.  I live with those responsibilities.

You have not made more than $1000 total in fifteen years of marriage, exactly?) I have to come up with the money and arrange for the kids to be cared for.

I love you.  I have loved caring for you.  But the time has come.  Be a child or be an adult.

If you are going to stay a child, step the fuck up.

Stay-at-home moms do not order or bring in food 97% of meals.  They don't have maids and gardeners.  They don't pay babysitters three days a week so they can ""lunch"" with their friends all afternoon.  

Working women work.   They bring home paychecks.  They try not to get fired.  Sometimes

You are not a stay-at-home mom or a working woman or anything in between.  You don't make an income and you don't care for the kids.  You cook fewer meals in a month than I do.  I do as much cleaning.  And I work.

You want my respect.  I do respect you.  You are an incredible person in your heart.  I love you.  But you demand I respect your efforts as a stay-at-home mom.  You demand I respect your work.  I respect those drives in you.  I know what you wish you did and I honor you for that.  But if you want me to treat you with fake respect


If you want to be a bum, but it's cool.  But for fuck's sake, stop demanded to be treated like the hardest-working, most earnest and careful woman in town.

My father was extremely abusive growing up. I had black eyes, so in school I was labeled as a ""problem"" for ""fighting"" too much outside of school. Kids were scared of me... when the truth was I was lonely. Having no friends led to me being bullied alot. It's such a long story... When I was 15 I had enough. I  ran away from home. I remember the first night I was gone I slept on a bench in the park. After a week my grandmother took me in. My grades improved and I in a sense started my life over and even made some friends. 

When I was 16 I wanted to meet my mom. I looked her up and went to her house. It was an EXTREMELY awkward reunion. We really didn't talk for 30 mins until she blurted out ""You know I never wanted you right

She glanced at me almost 3-4 times before realising it was me. Her face lit up and she started to walk twards me. I got scared, she hates me, or do I hate her. My heart felt like it fell out of my chest and I did the only thing my mind led me to believe I should do, and I ran. I ran as fast as I could to my car and drove away.

This week I have arrived at a very strange and broadening conclusion. I was abused by my ex-wife. So, do not do what happened to me. On either side. And DO in fact do what I ask at the end. But first, do not let anyone belittle or impugn you. Do not let anyone degrade you. You have wonderful qualities about you. Let them shine. In the same respect always fight hard to see the greatness in others. It’s not always visible but everyone has at least one thing that makes them good. Please find it.

You may be asking “how were you abused? You've got to be kidding.” Well some items include…

* The fights where she would yell at me to hit her. And would then chastise me for kicking a laundry basket when I became so infuriated with the request.
* How during our miscarriage I wasn't allowed to feel bad
* How she blamed me for every bad decision she made. It was always my fault she made that choice.
* How she blamed me for she weight problem (she was that way before we dated.....and still is a year and a half later. i'm apparently more powerful than i thought). 
* How she mocked me for crying over my grandfather's passing. 
* how she mocked me in front of friends even after i asked her (like a bitch) not to.
* how she threatened me (ultimatums – me or the dogs
* How she had other boyfriends in college and would chastise me for talking to a girl. 
* how she maintained her friendship with a man while we were married even when he told her that he loved her (seriously she should have ended it there
* the way that any feeling i had other than ""full support for her"" was mocked and made wrong. 
* the way that if i had a bad day
* how on my last birthday we spent together she invited her friends over for a party...i cooked...i cleaned....i did all the work....for her party....on my birthday....seriously
* the way she mocked my hobbies
* how she always told me ""you need to make more money” and how my job isn't good enough to support her wants.
* how i asked she to work out with me for 6 months. how she told me no every time
* how when we looked at houses
* how whenever she didn't get her way she would IMMEDIATELY throw a temper tantrum and spin it on me and how ""you always have to get your way."" granted....every pet....every home.....every piece of furniture, most of our friends.....all hers. 
* how she legitimately tried to convince me that my divorce lawyer wasn't looking out for me....only she was. how i should sign everything as quick as possible and not worry about trying to protect myself. but she got upset when i stood up for myself and tried to make me feel bad about it.
* How she attempted to say that my family wasn't there for me the way she was.
* The way she ran right to him when we separated. Would sleep at his place
* The way that she started to unofficially date him before she moved out…officially within a month. Within two years she’s now marrying the guy.
* How when I would ask for the last 4 months “why do you love me” it was all about how I was there for HER

People in abusive relationships tend to have their brazen and bold act to get out of it. Mine was cheating. The way a person stabs their abusive partner to show him she's not weak, but it finally makes sense to me why I did something so out of character. I met a wonderful and amazing person through it. a great friend and someone who i value and cherish. 

So on the start of my 33rd year, found myself again. Through the fog of self-hate and self-doubt I have finally seen myself. As I wiped it away I saw my own smiling face looking back at me asking “Where the hell have you been….lets have some fun.” For the first time in such a long time I feel whole again.

I made a rule last year

As I said, you look fantastic!” Imagine how much that simple statement from a random person would brighten your day. 

On my birthday do not with me a happy birthday. Take the love you would send my way and give it to someone new or someone old. Someone you may not know

Back then, but it scared the shit out of me considering how crazy they were. I never understood as they never had a solid reason why I shouldn't be with him

A few years later, I didn't tell them. He was caring and loving, and although I knew there were a million other boys who would be easier to date because of my parents, I was in love. Obviously this was stupid, but I never thought it through.

Once my father found out I was with him, calling me a whore, a cunt, spitting on me, and informing my family of what a terrible person I was. Most of my family is actually sane and took little notice, but his mother, my grandmother, sending me nasty emails about how I had ruined my fathers life and I was disgusting. 

I became very depressed during this time, when she said that he didn't need to know every detail of my life. About a month after all of this began, my grandma discovered she was in the beginning stages of small cell lung cancer. Although she began chemo, she died less than a month after she was diagnosed. 

It's been over three years since all of this, as she had plenty of other grandchildren besides me to ""live for"" and I couldn't understand why my one act of normal teenage behavior would affect her. My dad also tells me how I had ruined his health and blood pressure. 

I was trying to put this behind me but today I was using my grandmothers old computer as mine just died, and I briefly looked at them. They brought back all the old memories of being called a whore and a terrible human being. The sting of reading that my grandmother hates, or hated, me for hurting my dad is still there. 

I know I should have been more upfront about who I wanted to be with but my controlling religious family doesn't often foster open and understanding conversation. I was a good kid. I got into a great college, and I don't think I can ever forgive them for it.

We've been together for almost 6 years. Actually

So

* Dec 23. He calls me saying that he'll be in Moscow on Jan 3 and that he loves me. 

* Dec 24

* Dec 24, his phone is unavailable. I think ok, nothing to worry about, and send him sms.

* Jan 1. Call his grandmother. Would've called his parents

* Jan 7. Call his grandmother again. Listen to ""men are jerks"" thing again. She's angrier than before

-some calls in between

* Mar 8. Call his grandmother. Tell her that even if he doesn't want to come back

And here I am. I love him

I have my reasons to believe that he's fine but can't contact me in any way. His parents went abroad for a reason a few years ago. And those reasons have everything to do with his trip to Switzerland. I don't know how to say in in english

Now, as usual. Including bras and swimsuits. I never told anyone, especially not my brother, and I didn't think much of it. By the next year I realized that this wasn't right. I was not comfortable being around him and I think he was picking up on that. He tried being more touchy with me, almost exclusively when we were alone. 

Less than a year ago it snapped. He had insisted on reviewing a school project of mine, and once we finished looking at the powerpoint he whispered ""I want you."" This put me over the edge and I screamed. My brother ran in, but my step-dad had distanced himself and looked just a surprised as my brother. They both started asking what happened, and I started to cry and locked myself in the bathroom. 

I eventually told two of my friends about this, mom, and I discussed it. He denied everything and flipped out about just wanting to be like a father to me and my brother. He threatened to leave us if we accuse him of any other ""bullshit."" He's backed off me since, but has been starting his old behavior since christmas break. Oh, I didn't mention this before, but he is not actually married to my mom, although he insists on us calling him dad since I was very young.

One of the biggest fears is that if I try to get him out of our family, my brother and I would not be able to play club soccer or get college scholarships by extension without his financial support.

Let's start with me. I'm the oldest of 3, but I deem them full blood. They drive me crazy like full blood.. I'll get to them later. I want to keep going with my story.

My *biological* father was never in the picture. Always me and my mom, coloring in a corner while they and my cousin John were packing up. This man was moving in. I remember he walked over, and kicked me in the ribs. Then he mushed my face in cigarette ashes in the floor. My cousin John kicked his ass, and told my mom he was taking me home. I ended up in the truck, cleaned up, wedged between my mom and my stepfather. 

I was right to hate this man. I recall instances of being locked in my room, just because. I do remember times of making cakes and ice cream, selling lemonade, all that. I had a childhood.. sort of. I remember this one time, I was drug out of bed. I got so scared, I peed myself. He rubbed my nose in it, like I was a bad dog. Much hell ensued. I was 5. 

Then we moved away, nor would the unborn child (my sister), nor I. We moved anyways, and lots of fighting happened. It was okay- my grandfather still loved and protected me.. 

Until he died. I will never forget this. He'd fallen, on my way to a sleepover. I'd chatted away animatedly, about the crib games and the elderly lady who liked me. I left him a rose I'd gotten in the gift shop, said I'd be back tomorrow, I love you and left. 8:30 that night, I call home, with purple in my hair. My mom sounds distant- she says she;s just tired, I go home. Outside, then cried for days.

This signaled my life going to hell. With him gone, on top of being super-good at school. My privileges were removed- no more books, no more art, no more music, no more friends, no more nothing. I had no life anymore, past pain, before it got worse..

Six weeks after my grandfather died, my mouth taped shut. My nightgown was ripped off (I had no panties- forbidden) and it hurt so badly, I was screaming. Loud enough to be smothered in the pillow. I was crying. I had no idea what was going on- I could feel hands, mouth.. other things- everywhere. I was left like that, too. At 6AM, I was drug up, forced into an ice shower

This soon became routine. I was beaten, wore make-up. I never spoke to anyone in school. I just did my work, came home. People teased me mercilessly, it was hard. HE would laugh.

Time went on, I was introduced to BDSM. I went in the hospital more than once.. they laid off after the third trip for a while, some real investigating was going on. Nothing, though. Apparently my word didn't count for enough.. And once it was over, they began again. They DID lay off or almost a year, I had SOME respite.

At 12 1/2, the thing that finally broke me.. I could handle anything, but being violated, body and soul? No.. 

Then at 13, winter break and spring break. He was psycho, but.. the day he tried to hurt my siblings, something in me snapped.  I kicked his ass.. but what he did to us.. broke me so badly I'll never be okay. That night, and summer.. It's going to be really fucking hard to say this. I'm so fucking ashamed, but.. HE.. 

HE tied me up every night

It's out. That unbelievable mother-fucker.. made us.. I can't say it again.. I'm curled up, and then I'd be the monster.. wait, I already am, I failed them.. I failed them.. I'm so fucking sorry.. Don't hate me, I'm so fucking sorry..

That heartless, worthless, piece-of-shit bastard broke us all. I fought back HARD, to no avail. I went into counseling, overhauled myself, cleaned up my act. I poured myself into school. But I was gone. No confidence, no self-esteem, inferior, rebelling, attempts to be perfect.. 

At 16, I finally began to heal. It's taken a lot, and tolled everyone. I remember when my siblings hated me.. that's fine. I hate them too. I hated saving them.. but I don't regret it. They didn't deserve it, but I found out my sister's been raped by a different man, one whose since been 'paid back'..

Here I am today. Clean a year. I've got friends. I've got a bit of a life. I'm ready to hold a real job. I'm in therapy three times a week. I'm pulling myself together

I hate him, I HATE HIM! YOU BASTARD! YOU'VE DESTROYED ME, YOU DESTROYED THEM AND ME! YOU TOOK AWAY MY LIFE, MY INNOCENCE, MY EVERYTHING! I FUCKING HATE YOU SO MUCH!.. AND YOU, MOM, FAMILY, TO SHOW, UNCARING WHORE! YOU CUNTRAG

I apologize, in one piece. I function again. I'm an artist again. Life is good. The hard part is having little trust. I NEED my control back. I can't hurt people, I'm terrified of even mildly disappointing anyone. I'm terrified of men.. and my poor SO knows it. But, it's the teeny-tiny things. He lets me tell him to do tiny things, like bring me water if I'm busy, or grab a book for me. He calls me his Mistress- I like it. Every day, he compliments me, very well

I just had to let this all out. I couldn't take it. I'll answer anything asked

Reddit.. I'm so sorry I made you listen to me. I had to say it. It's been years

Thank you.. and I'm sorry for anything you found offensive.

Edit: There are some things I need to add. 
* Messed up the word 'destroyed' in the title. My bad. 
* My family seemed to either not know or simply not care. Inexcusable either way.
* He feels NOTHING. No guilt, and tried to make me a liar. I'm not sure how this worked. He's actually tried to get me to acknowledge him as ""my father"". I don't HAVE a father. After the evil!? You want me to be your CHILD?! Even if you were a MODEL FATHER FIGURE which you aren't, I STILL wouldn't want to. Besides, I'm over 18. Sheesh.
* The reason I posted. He's coming down to see his children for Christmas. I turned into ice when I heard- my blood is cold. I want to run away.
* This is the big one. I broke down and cried because of all the support. I honestly expected this to get buried. My heart goes out to all of you.

The first time I saw a cross-dresser I was intrigued. What she did with her body other women in the community were envious of. I admired her beauty just as much as I admired the beauty of natural born women. I struggled with my sexuality since I was a young man because of this - I was too worried about properly labeling myself and my sexuality. 

Eventually at 19 I would have my first sexual experience with a cross-dresser. She was voluptuous. The minute I saw her I knew that she was what I wanted. First experience was everything I hoped for, I'm now 30. I love women. I want to marry a woman. I do however enjoy the fantasy of being with a cross-dresser. It's only a sexual fantasy because I have no intentions nor desires to pursue a relationship like that. So that's how I've defined my sexuality. **I've come to terms with the fact that it's okay for me to have these desires.** Even if I don't voice them with anyone in public.

One day he followed us to the park and parked by some trees. He held up a gun and gestured for me to come closer. I was scared of him, and we ran as fast as we could. We didn't stop running until we were home with the door locked behind us and my Mom called the cops. 

 I haven't slept in two days because I finally realized that this was around when my best friend stopped coming to school. I can't remember--was she in the park with the three of us that day? Jesus Christ, but it would make my family's odd behavior on the subject over the years make an awful lot of sense, especially the weeks between her disappearance and the news of her death. 

I can't find an obituary for her

**UPDATE:** I just had a very long talk with my mother and sister and I think I've figured a few things out. The memory loss covers more time than I initially thought

When I asked them about her they were quick to assure me that she wasn't at the park the day I saw the man with the gun, but no matter what I said she just kept saying, ""That's enough for today"" and eventually became magically deaf until I changed the subject. It's not like her at all. Why would she be so open about everything else and then clam up? I'm trying not to be angry with her, but I don't get why the hell she won't help me make sense of this. Hopefully Dad will be more reasonable.

I'm still determined to find out what happened, Colorado. She was six or seven when she died and I think she was an only child.

I'm a 31 year old male who is only now starting to realize and understand that I'm good enough to have a relationship and be loved for who I am. For years, that my mere presence was an imposition to them, and that my needs were something best kept to myself if I didn't want to be shown the door. My sister has never gone more than a week without a long-term boyfriend since she turned 15, which only made me feel worse. Years of solitude passed and I got progressively more sad and isolated. 

I've dated quite a bit

I've been told by many women that I'm highly attractive, like I know that I have brown hair and I'm good at putting sentences together. I was also repeatedly shamed and inculcated with sex-negative messages (that's a subject for an entirely different OMC), and the combination of sexual shame and a feeling of inherent inadequacy has given me performance issues in the bedroom, which makes me want to bash my head through a brick wall - all of my youngest and most sexually potent years are passing by in a blur. 99% of my sexual activity has remained relegated to masturbation and porn. I've probably had sex less than 30 times in my entire life. I WANT SEX, like any normal well-adjusted male, but it's always had such shame and embarrassment attached to it that the idea of approaching a woman for sex feels like asking if I can take a dump on her kitchen floor.

Background: Abusive alcoholic father left when I was 11, her confidant, her sounding board, every possible role of emotional support. I was too young to realize what was happening at the time but now I'm understanding that I lost my entire childhood and a major part of my adult life dealing with things I should never have had to deal with and feeling guilty and worthless when I couldn't deliver.

Looking back, where we went to Chicago, went on a dress-up dinner cruise and spent four days exploring the city together. I was 17 and didn't know any better, and now it just makes my stomach clench. When I did leave, she told me she slept with my pillow because it smelled like me (retch).

************************************
Original Post:
This might pale in comparison to a lot of real problems people have but I'm so mad at the world right now. I'm 25 and I have a 13 year old sister who I practically raised. I would do anything for her.  She is the perfect kid. She always studied hard and never had to be told what to do. She's polite

She has always wanted to go to a concert and every time I look into getting tickets the only that are available are so overpriced I can't afford it. Today I thought, so I paid $450 for the 3 and I was so excited I called my parents to let them know. Right now my sister and her friend are just giddy with excitement about going to this concert. They get to see all their favorite musicians (yeah - Bieber and One Direction, they're 13 year old girls). 

The problem is I'm also positive they are fake. I realized it after I did a barcode scan on all the tickets. The barcodes are all the same. And a local ticketmaster agent who couldnt' verify if it was real or fake noticed one of the tickets has a different shaped apostrophe than the other. In other words, what really upsets me is knowing what my sister's reaction will be when she finds out. 

She'll want to be mad at first, to the core. So many little things I didn't notice when I bought those tickets. I wish I could just take that moment back. 

TL;DR: I bought my awesome little sister who never asks for anything tickets to the Jingle Ball concert. Tickets are fake and I hate that I have to break the news to her.
*******************************************
EDIT 1: Wow. You guys are amazing. Here I am clearing my mind and you start helping a total stranger. Regardless of what happens
*******************************************
EDIT 2: I love what a little shut-eye can do for the nerves. I talked with my sister and told her what happened. I called earlier to tell her and her friend's mom told her friend. I think she took it well but obviously she's upset. She had one of those sudden emotional shocks but immediately said it's okay. She didn't really get mad

As for calling into the station, and just because I made a stupid mistake (to buy tickets off a guy on craigslist), doesn't mean I should get special treatment. I'm going to keep trying anyway but I've got to be at work soon. Also, thanks so much to all of you who offered to make a donation.
*******************************************
EDIT 3: I did actually just get through and the kind lady on the phone let me know that unfortunately there's nothing they can do. They said they gave away all their tickets and the only way I could get them is by listening to the show. I'll try to call in as much as I can but the odds aren't very good.
*******************************************
EDIT 4: I had a pretty incredible day today considering how bad yesterday was. Even if no miracles happen, but I'm doing fine. I don't have a couch because I just started living on my own in an expensive suburban city and I'm just waiting to save some money first. Buying expensive tickets obviously wasn't part of the plan but it's nothing that can't be recouped given a little time. The truth is I have a decent temp job which pays enough to get by. My naivete or stupidity shouldn't be rewarded. 

Now onto some real news. Today I called the 42nd precinct where a really helpful detective suggested I called NYPD's DICE (offhand I can't remember what this stands for) who might be able to setup a quick sting to catch this guy. He also told me to call the 44th precinct because the exchange happened on their turf (near Yankee Stadium). No body answered at the DICE but I talked with a policeman from the 44th. He said I could come in and report a larceny. Once I'm there, but on the whole, I feel like I've become a better person because of what happened. 

Finally, it's okay. I don't think I've ever felt closer to my sister than I do right now.
***********************************************
EDIT 5: GOING TO JINGLE BALL! Reddit and Reddit username ""statefarmer""...to quote the Beatles who I sourced for my username, her friend and my dad at the train station and they are hustling over to the pre-event before it ends. At this event they have a chance to meet Justin Bieber and a few other artists. My dad has no idea who any of the artists are so it would be funny to see his reaction. If they aren't a 70s-80s Russian Euro-pop artist, he's probably never heard of them. I'm going to meet up with the group prior to the concert and switch places with my dad who has a holiday party to go to tonight. 

When I posted this initially, and Brandi and Linda from State Farm, you are the best! You've made two young teenagers so happy today! They will never forget tonight, and neither will I! Reddit and State Farm, I love you. BIG LOVE!

One more thing...I gave the fake tickets and a few sharpies to the girls to hopefully get some autographs tonight. 
*************************************************
EDIT 6: Last update: Jingle Ball was awesome! We had a small hiccup as the tickets were for two different venues. We thought they were all for the viewing party so we waited in line. My sister handed over the ticket, neither of them had a cell phone so once we separated there was no way we could contact each other. Their seats had a view of the back of the stage and a screen but not a direct view of the stage. Once I set them on their way, I was thinking how awkward it would be for me to explain to a supervisor the story of the tickets so that I could get into the viewing party with my now dead legitimate ticket. I might have just walked around the city but it was raining. It was funny because it felt like I was one of maybe 8 men in a sea of hundreds of screaming girls. What's worse is that I was walking in alone, no girlfriend, no kids. Once I got into the theater, my seat was pretty close to the front and I had to be on of the tallest people there. I bought some popcorn, got comfortable and enjoyed every minute of the concert. Actually seeing all those artists perform 'live' was really awesome. Most of them sounded much better in person than recorded. It was a VERY energetic concert, the girls loved it. They were all smiles

Oh

You don't know me...but you slept with my girlfriend.

[She] and I had been dating six months when you messaged her on Facebook wanting to ""catch up"" for a drink. You caught up, you bought her drinks, and you took her back to your house and you had sex with her. Maybe this was your intention, and maybe it wasn't. It doesn't matter now. She and I are done - and you, [motherfucker], played the key role in that.

What do you expect is going to happen now

I've had my words with [her] about this already

""I'm a lying cunt and I don't know what to say. I ruin everything and I'm sorry. Even if it means losing you - I can't stop crying. Please just break up with me. I'm fucked up. I'm a liar. I'm so fucked up, not me cause I'm a fucking trainwreck. I'm going out of my mind and you're too good to be with someone disgusting like me even though I love you. Fuck, I'm sorry.""

This is what she's doing to herself because you decided you would take a former friend of yours out for drinks and see what happens. ""She's got a boyfriend

Well, but our relationship is over because the decisions you were a part of and she is no longer my responsibility, she is her own responsibility. She is in such a dark place she doesn't want help and she is so drawn into herself that she is the only one who can bring herself out of it and she doesn't think she'll ever get better. Based on the text she sent me that I quoted above, she is in no place to even start helping herself. She is drowning, and that is a direct result of you not leaving well enough alone or even being happy for her being in a safe, loving, stable relationship for once in her life.

But you don't care about her

I don't know why you did it. Maybe you're bored. Maybe you're lonely. Maybe you're a good guy who is in a bad place and you made a bad decision. Maybe you're just an asshole. Again, and maybe not for her on a personal level - and again, that is a direct result of you chasing after a girl who was happy in her relationship so you could get your rocks off.

You're 25 years old

Next time you need to feel good about yourself, go up to her and say ""hi."" It's that simple. You're better than having to prey on girls you knew when you were 12 and ruin their relationships just because you're too insecure to find someone of your own.

The worst part, my grandpa found out. My brother had made me do something for him one day and my grandpa either overheard or saw or something, I still don't know.

He also insinuated that the would have liked me to do the same for him, but I didn't. To this day, though, but I've never told anyone (about my grandpa or my brother) except my boyfriend and my best friend because I don't want to tear my family apart. I'm also not sure they would believe me.

I was getting a new pair of dress pants for my school's Turnabout dance, I was the first victim.

I recall having a stomach ache all afternoon, I should have gone straight for the bathroom, but I naively decided that it wasn't that serious. After a couple minutes of scoping out I picked out two pairs of pants and my parents led me towards the dressing rooms.

There was a speaker right by the arch leading into the dressing rooms, it was coated in a putrid shade.

Naturally, oh fuck. Ok, what are my options?* I scanned the room quickly, surveying any possible escape route. I was becoming increasingly aware of the seeping stream of shit between my ass cheeks. Should I swallow my pride and tell my parents? The very thought of the resulting conversation answered my question for me. There was no way. *I need something to wipe with. Paper, plastic, anything.* It was around this time I noticed a pair of Dockers laying on a chair in the corner. The smell of my own dookie began to fill my nostrils, choking me into submission. At that moment, and began to think simply in terms of survival. My asshole needed to be wiped

I tried on my dress pants, is that upon exiting that dressing room, I felt no remorse. I had no regard for the circumstances. When paying for my dress pants, I smiled with the man behind the counter and asked him about his day. He had absolutely no idea that I had ruined a $60 pair of his pants. Following my checkout, I immediately sought out a bathroom and proceeded to unleash a torrent of shit. While I sat there on the toilet, I thought of the man or woman that would find those balled-up, destroyed pants. Who would have to handle those? Who would smell that stench first, or would they just throw out the evidence like I had? What had I done?

Ever since, I'm not so sure anymore.

I have a 14 year old daughter.  She's pierced, I know she's going to stand out.  But it's gotten to the point that it is utterly ridiculous and I'm so tired of hearing ""well, if you didn't let her dress like that.""  Or ""if you made her go to church.""  Like what - only kids that wear Abercrombie and are Baptist are protected from harassment??  Bullshit.

My kid is completely appropriate in how she dresses.  Hot Topic may not be MY choice

No ONE deserves to be bullied.  

This is the letter that I wrote her principal.  

&gt;My daughter, the Principal and her teachers multiple times.  There are a group of girls who are singling her out, making fun of her appearance, her dress, mocking her speech in classes, even threatening to beat her up.  She's had her ipod stolen, which was worth $250.  The boy who has it has bragged about it but nothing was done.  XXXXX is scared to go to any more authority figures as each time she has

&gt;XXXXXXX has been relentlessly bullied for her religious beliefs - including in front of teachers.  She's had kids telling her with teachers involved in the conversation that she is going to hell.  The teacher's never once stood up for my daughter.  She's an 8th grade student and a 14 year old child.   Her religious beliefs are her own and are her legally protected right.  I also firmly believe that God does not condone this kind of bullying of a child

&gt;Specific examples include - during XXXXXXX's math class on Wednesday 5/8 - a student named YYY mocked XXXXXXX by repeating her speech in a distorted and ""slow"" voice for several minutes.  This was obvious to the entire group of kids.  This is also the same girl who has threatened to beat XXXXXX up and also has intimated that she has a group of friends willing to do the same.

&gt;In the gym locker room,  her clothes - even her underwear.  It's gotten to the point that every single day, she begs to miss gym.  This is primarily a group of girls that includes a girl named ZZZZZz and her friends.  

&gt;Her ipod was stolen by a boy named FFFFF.  We've contacted the school about this several times and were assured it was ""being investigated.""  

&gt;We have allowed XXXXXX to try and deal with this on her own - encouraging her to speak to counselors and teachers.  This has only made things worse for XXXXXX.  

&gt;I would like to make sure that the school is aware of these situations so that they can keep XXXXXX safe.  She is a very sweet and compassionate little girl and we very much wish she had a better school experience.  Her grades have suffered since this has begun and her stress levels at home are significant.

First, a word that so many women seem to throw around like meaningless confetti nowadays.

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I've always been one of the guys. I get it. Often guys make sexist, shouldn't you be on your knees servicing me like the slave you are? And so on. It's just a joke and no one cares because no one means it.

But every single time I log on to reddit and I look at comments and I see someone make a joke that could just possibly have sexist undertones, you know? But I actually spent a few days researching and learning about it and I was very moved. Then I discovered multiple forums/pages/subreddits supported by so called feminists, and I was appalled by their behavior.

I grew up thinking feminism means **equality**, 3 out of every 5 self proclaimed feminists I meet online approach issues with a bitchy, closed minded attitude and they advocate for some things that disgust me. 

For example, it was straight up she  decided to do him. In the morning she realized she didn't like him and wouldn't have done that sober and asked the community if she should press charges. And they said yes! I understand what men mean when they say that'll ruin his life, because I've known a girl who made an accusation of rape for simple revenge (a whole different situation) and saw what it did to him. So please tell me why you have the right to ruin his life because you regret what you did? He was drunk too. Maybe he took one look at you and thought ""Oh, nasty! I've gotta quit drinking!"" but was too nice to say it and sure as hell wasn't going to claim is was rape.

1373209493.0,1hsybw,Went to a brothel recently - couldn't perform sexually..Part I did enjoy taught me something,sarcastic_doorknob,97,16,26,"**So a little background**: I broke up with my SO (f) of ~1 year, I seem to miss her more every day and I constantly think about how good life was with her. As you can imagine

In terms of other stuff about me that I think is pertinent to this story. I'm in my mid-20s, physically attractive (6 ft, athletic build) and able to build rapport with people quite easily.

**Fast forward to last night...** I went out drinking with some friends (had a shit night out in terms of meeting new women) and on the way home I managed to convince myself to visit a brothel. I wasn't too drunk and I figured spending some time with a beautiful young woman would help get me out of my current dismal state. When I entered the main lounge area

There were quite a few decent ladies around this joint and I found myself particularly attracted to this young, the bare minimum 'standard' service grants you oral and vaginal sex with the lady leading the act (ie. you have no say when you get oral, what position you have sex in, can't really touch her that much). The deluxe service allows you more intimacy with the lady (ie. kissing, touching and control of her by you are allowed). I opted for the standard service as I imagined having an attractive young lady in front of me would be more than enough for me to have a great time. After a few health checks and a shower, this is where the (supposed) fun began.

We started things off light and she proceeded to give me a back massage. This got me in a relaxed state and it gave us a chance to chat some more. After the rubdown, I'm not exactly a germaphobe, but the thought of kissing a (legal) prostitute would usually disgust me and I'm very surprised I didn't recoil my face back in disgust when she started kissing me.

As we locked lips, trying to make it hard to get things going. But at this point, I believe the only reason why I got aroused was because of the intimate nature of our kiss and embrace. After a short while, she put a condom on my cock and started giving me head. Surprisingly (even though I had a condom on - this has never been a problem) I did not enjoy oral and I found it difficult to stay hard. Knowing my wood was slowly diminishing, I suggested getting straight to some PiV action to close out this experience.

I managed to keep enough wood to last a few minutes with her on top, when this happened our time was up and I had to get dressed up and leave. Even though I didn't cum, I found the experience very rewarding as I felt some of the intimacy I'd been missing since I broke up with my gf. I also think this woman was taken aback to how happy I was, even though I didn't cum.

Even though there are a number of social stigmas associated with visiting a brothel by a man (ie. you can't attract women without paying them hence you are low value)

* I don't possess the sport-fucking gene (the ability to have sex with no emotional attachment) as my sexual arousal is largely driven off the intimacy of the act (ie. I enjoyed kissing/caressing her body a lot more than her sucking my cock). **The only times where I was able to get aroused reminded me of the intimate moments I shared with my ex-gf.**
* I miss my ex greatly and until I find a way to deal with her not being in my life

That's all for now

1364080628.0,1avv6n,I wish my sister would have succeeded when she tried to kill herself.,decomposeur,93,9,12,"Sorry for the wall of text. 

My sister and I have never really got along. When we were kids, getting me in trouble, typical sibling bullshit. I'm not here to grind an ax about that. I'm just giving you some background: she and I have never really been close.
A few years ago, then wound up pregnant, then he disappeared. She kept the baby (and denied that she was pregnant up until six months into the pregnancy) (no, really). She dated another guy who left her, then one of our friend's fathers, which tore his marriage and our friendship apart, until finally she started dating a guy solidly for a couple of years. He turned out to be as insane as she is. 

I am almost certain that my niece (the child from my sister's vanishing boyfriend) endured abuse in her and her new boyfriend's home. When we first got custody of her, starting when she was two, she used to put her hands down her pants and play with herself. She used to have nightmares and kick and yell out things like ""I don't want it!"" in her sleep. Even now, years later, she still is not sleeping throughout the night. When she stays with me, she has to sleep next to me, and if I get up in the middle of the night, I have tried to be very kind and patient with her as she is now very withdrawn and sensitive

My sister got pregnant with another kid from her shitty boyfriend. This time, and her boyfriend was angry with her about the baby being small and unhealthy. As a result, she hardly held the baby too. He had to stay in the hospital for almost two weeks after being born, and he jaundiced and had a lot of trouble breathing. No one really thought he was going to make it. My sister told me she wished he wouldn't have. 

My sister and her boyfriend had a rough relationship. I didn't think he was outright abusing her (the truth about my niece didn't come out until after their relationship ended. I live in another state, but my sister wouldn't allow it because she wanted to keep their family together. My sister told us later that she used to watch her husband beat the shit out of her babies. She said it was because she was afraid of him, but I'm pretty sure it was because she was zonked out on drugs as often as possible. 

About a year ago, and the kids were taken into protective custody. It took us months to get them back. They now live with my parents because I live in a studio apartment. My family is not rich, and my parents don't have a lot of money to throw on a lawyer. I spent thousands (right at five thousand, to be exact) of my tuition money that I saved to return to school on a lawyer to get the kids out of protective custody. My sister was mad that I didn't spend that money bailing her out of jail. She didn't care that her kids were taken away from our family; she was upset because she couldn't visit her boyfriend in the hospital because she was stuck in jail. She has said before that her kids ruined her relationship. Later on I did manage to borrow enough money against my retirement to get my sister out of jail just so she would have a chance to lawyer up for her domestic violence criminal case. 

Since bringing her home from jail, too. She accused my mom of brainwashing her kids because they call her by her name and not ""mommy"". To be honest, my mom has only ever let her them call her granny so as to not confuse them. Sometimes they call me 'mommy' and sometimes they call my mother 'mommy'. We correct them, but they are legitimately confused as to who we all are and as to who my sister is because they don't remember her too much from being in jail for a while.

My sister wasn't supposed to stay with my family because of her domestic violence case, and now she is staying with them because she managed to screw up every opportunity she had for herself to stay somewhere else. She attacked my friend that was letting her stay with them, she was kicked out of a shelter for attacking a manager, and she was thrown out of another home that a friend from church was letting her stay in because she was stealing their pain medicine out of the bathroom cabinet. 

She fully believes that my mother abused us when we were children and that I've repressed all memory of it happening my whole life. While I will say that my mother isn't the best mother, she gives my sister money to drive out of town to visit her abusive boyfriend (my sister becomes very, very violent if we don't let her make the drive to see him), and no matter what has happened with my sister, my mom always lets her come home, even if she is physically violent toward her, which happens about once a week or so. 

She tells my parents all the time what her children will do, and she is a worthless pile of shit. She can't work because she has a pending court case, which is what employers like to call a ""red flag"", so she just stays home all day and sits on their couch. Both my parents and I work full time jobs. She actually bitches to my parents that she doesn't like being home all day with HER children. The financial toll of caring for two toddlers and a grown idiot have burdened my parents to the point of having to move from their four bedroom house into a tiny two bedroom apartment filled with roaches. I bring them and the children groceries every Sunday, and my sister bitches that I'm bringing her kids generic groceries so that I can have named brand food for myself, even though anyone in my kitchen can see that my cabinets are filled with *literally* only Ramen and hot chocolate. 

I know that my sister is sick. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. My mom spends so much fucking money every month for counseling (for her abusive relationship) and for prescribed medicine to keep my sister calm, and she constantly bullies and intimidates my parents in an effort to force them into signing custody of her children back over to her so that she could get back with her boyfriend, whom she has started referring to as her husband. I wish she would have succeeded in killing herself once upon a time so that she wouldn't bother us anymore. If she was dead, maybe I could lie to her kids every night when tucking them in and tell them stories all about how they did have a great mom who was a lovely person that they would be so proud of if they knew her.

1359448157.0,17hjzu,No one will listen to me -- so I turn to Reddit,fallopianluge,99,16,82,"Hello

So

I used to love being Asian -- I was the stereotype: excellent grades, etc.

I found out my Dad cheated on my Mom and it completely ruined me. He didn't just cheat on her

I retaliated until I spat blood and couldn't talk for over a week -- not that I had anything left to say. I couldn't eat or function

Now this is shaping up to be a pretty sad sob story, I really just need to type it out and have the possibility that MAYBE someone would read it.

My grades started dropping

I had mononucleosis in grade 12 and it messed me up even more, as I did). So my plan was to just take the remaining prerequisites and then take random courses to get a high GPA to get into business by next year. It's my 2nd year now, and I think I may have to take another ""bum"" year just to get a high enough GPA to get into business and that makes my parents and especially me see myself as nothing but a pile of expired potential and fucking uselessness. I'm still tired and there's nothing I can do.

It's my 2nd year now, but he travels a lot and is mysterious about everything. It hurts so badly to just accept that there is no trust and he's as connected to me as a stranger I've never met before when I used to adore him with all my heart.

I feel like the Asian stereotype is mocking me now. I don't have the grades, but they always try to change the subject and make me feel better, but it doesn't.

My grandpa just died too. My Mom is tired of me asking her if I could talk to her

But now I'm at the end of my story

I trusted you. Against my instincts and against all the odds

I feel so betrayed. So cheated.

She hurt you. She cheated and for you to return that same pain to me after feeling it yourself and saying that you love me? It's a deep burn that stings my heart.

You couldn't even tell me without me questioning. The 20 seconds after I got the courage to ask were the longest seconds of my life. A painful silence. I knew the answer. Maybe I knew it from the start.  

What did I do wrong? I feel stupid. Inadequate. Was I not pretty enough? Did I not give you what you wanted? What can I do? I don't understand. 

I feel bitter. Is there hope in love if no one values it? If everyone keeps breaking the bonds of it? I don't know if I can lay my trust in anyone again. There's too much pain, have a good heart, and you still are betrayed...what hope is there? 

I did all I could to prove my good intentions and earn your trust because you didn't want me to hurt YOU because you were scarred by the hurt SHE caused you.
