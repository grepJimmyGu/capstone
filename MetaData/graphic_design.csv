About a month ago I asked for your advice. I wasn't earning any money despite working for 8-10 hours a day (and my financial situation was already pretty bad) and I was stuck with clients who didn't respect me. I was about to quit this and get a job as a cashier at a PC hardware store admitting failure and scratching my dream of becoming a designer.

... but I took your advice. I fired most of my clients and discussed my rates with the rest of them - some are paying me more than double what they paid before. I also started frequenting /r/forhire and made about $1k this month there making several people very happy with my services.

I'm feeling really confident in my skills now. I also feel I progressed ALOT during the last 30 days (certainly more than during the last 6 months!). I put more thought in what I do

The result of it all? Well, and I'm just sitting there in front of a retina mbp and high-end eizo monitor ~~masturbating~~ designing really cool stuff. Never in my life have I felt so awesome, happy and stress-free.

The Post
------------------------
Every day

But what they're NOT doing

To those who are seeking artists, with the talent and skill to perform the services you need? A dozen? Five? One? none?

More than likely

And this is not really a surprise.

In this country

So, would it make sense to ask your mechanic to work on your car for free? Would you look him in the eye, with a straight face, and tell him that his compensation would be the ability to have his work shown to others as you drive down the street?

Would you offer a neurosurgeon the opportunity to add your name to his resume as payment for removing that pesky tumor? (Maybe you could offer him a few bucks for materials. What a deal!)

Would you be able to seriously even CONSIDER offering your web hosting service the chance to have people see their work

If you answered yes to ANY of the above

But then tell me why would you think it is okay to live out the same

Graphic artists, etc., are skilled tradesmen. As such, to consider them as, or deal with them as, anything less than professionals fully deserving of your respect is both insulting and a bad reflection on you as a sane, reasonable person. In short

A few things you need to know;

1. It is not a great opportunity for an artist to have his work seen on your car/zine/website/bedroom wall

2. It is not clever to seek a student or beginner in an attempt to get work for free. It's ignorant and insulting. They may be students, because you were learning essential job skills for the real world? Yes, your proposition it JUST as stupid.

3. The chance to have their name on something that is going to be seen by other people, after being paid as they should. It's not compensation. It's their right, and it's a given.

4. Stop thinking that you're giving them some great chance to work. Once they skip over your silly ad, and as such, will pay them. There are far more jobs needing these skills than there are people who possess these skills.

5. Students DO need experience. But they do NOT need to get it by giving their work away. In fact

If you your company or gig was worth listing as desired experience

6. (This one is FOR the artists out there, and find what they like most. They will then usually have someone who works for them, or someone who works incredibly cheap because they have no originality or talent of their own, reproduce that same work, or even just make slight modifications to it, and claim it as their own. You will NOT be paid, you will NOT win the contest. The only people who win, are the underhanded folks who run these ads. This is speculative, completely. For more information on this subject

So to artists/designers/illustrators looking for work, and avoid people who do not intend to pay you. Whether they are spec�gigs, or just some guy who wants a free mural on his living room walls. They need you. You do NOT need them.

And for those who are looking for someone to do work for free  please wake up and join the real world. The only thing you're accomplishing is to insult those with the skills you need.

Saying the work he did for free was meaningful and worth monetary reward. This has sparked a nationwide discussion about the ethics of the unpaid internship.

As someone who is a year out of art school this topic couldn't be more relevant to me. I've experienced the unpaid internship system, only to be out unemployed 3 months later.

I've had one unpaid internship in my career

In my mind there should be levels like this:

**Unpaid:** Little experience or ability that would help the establishment make money. This would be like a mentorship where the person is just coming to learn. Not much is expected of them

**Minimum Wage:** Experienced but has never worked at a business doing design. Will touch client projects. Mostly learning from experience

**Fair Wage:** Maybe not the maximum wage of a starting employee

I'm wanting to write a full article on this at some point and I'd love to hear what you guys think. Especially if you are someone who has to hire designers and interns at your firm.

As I see it now, fun, and easy to understand design education videos. This is where I'd like to make my entry.

I'm currently a sophomore enrolled in Visual Communication Design but have been designing in total for about 5 years now (damn I feel old saying that). Because of this I have a nice mix of self taught and disciplined design principles flowing through my work. Like most of you, and I did things MY way. Getting to college however proved to be a lot different than I imagined. Once I got into some higher level courses, I dealt with a ton of criticism, so much so that it felt like design bootcamp. For many of us this was a complete shock. When I was a freshman, my entire class consisted of about 200 people. Now, as a Sophomore, that's down to about 100.

My reasoning for creating these videos is to ease the transition between going from a completely self taught designer to becoming a formally educated designer. In my videos, design principles (this would probably take about 5-10 vids to explain of it), tutorials with adobe programs like photoshop and illustrator, and I would definitely like to showcase other designer's work!

So my question to the graphic designers of reddit. Would you have any interest in this? As of now

**EDIT:** From all the feedback, I'm willing to help. Thanks for the response everyone!

**EDIT #2:** Link to youtube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/ptrklwdn (no videos posted yet but feel free to sub).

**EDIT #3:** I can't believe the amount of overwhelming support for this! Went from 48 to 134 subscribers in a night. Thank you so much to everyone who has gotten behind this. I'm going to get to work immediately!

Hi all

Due to some voting trends we've noticed regarding the submission of designers' own work getting through the cracks

**For one month users will be able to submit their own completed

What **we *are* allowing is the submission of completed, in the form of a self post** where you either explain the process of the project for academic benefit, or the conceptual goal and thinking behind the ideas for inspirational reasons. Perhaps some of you would like to make AMAs about the project. 

All posts of this nature should be tagged [OC]  or [AMA] with the title or the client and the media if applicable.

**Example**

**[OC] Reddit Logo Design

**[AMA] Reddit Brochure Design

We do not desire any damage to the traffic at /r/design_critiques

This is a month trial which

So

________________________________________________

**We will be starting a weekly questions thread aimed at novice designers that will begin on Monday 22nd October.** The thread will be called [Ask the experts] and we'd hope that all you design experts will show up to help out! This thread will hopefully prove to be the ideal place to answer all you novice designers' questions about the world and profession (vocation?) of design. There will be suggested topics each week to help the thread along but we encourage all questions to be directed there. It will be submitted by a moderator so it receives some highlighting. It'd be nice if it kept going all week

That's it for now, suggestions or queries.

If you don't have a passion for design in your heart you should NOT become a designer. ""I like to doodle"" and ""I have used photoshop"" are NOT good reasons to become a designer. I graduated with a bunch of people like this, retail employees, and realtors.

Design is NOT easy

You will be getting paid to deliver brand messages and hawk product. You will be producing banner ads that no one will ever see/click. You are not painting Guernica or even drawing Garfield. 

You will be busting your ass to sell your ideas to dimwit clients who typically don't know shit about design and don't place ANY value on you or your skillset. 

You will be working with and taking direction people who get to positions of power by brown-nosing

You will be focusing primarily on typography and content organization, illustration, icons, etc. (about 90%/10%)

Unless you truly enjoy all the anal, leading, grids and guides, stock image/footage searching, color correcting, clipping paths, endless revisions — NOT crosshatching a portrait of your cat wearing a beret)

Yes I realize I am an asshole and that this post is rife with potentially-unfair generalizations... if you disagree

**Update:** I was always a lefty, acting, music, etc. They were all hobbies and I never took any of them seriously and was never the best artist in class. I sucked at sports and had a passing interest in most other studies — enough to get decent grades but I never really considered a career in math, science, or ""business"". I always knew I wanted to be an ""artist"" of some kind, but didn't even have a concept of ""graphic design"" until I was in high school. I image most designers or people who consider getting into design fit this bill.

But I also clearly remember being impressed with certain logos as a kid and considering how the creators managed to create such recognizable images with such few shapes. being blown away by album artwork and t-shirt designs and silkscreen rock posters and wishing so badly that one day I could make something as awesome as the stuff I found cool.

I went to college for photography at 18 (but took the general art curriculum

Lots of creative people are drawn to the idea of design because it's one of the few ways to actually make a living doing something ""creative"" — where less than 3% of painters, musicians, etc will ever make enough money to support themselves, there's a lot of money being thrown around in design and advertising — enough to feed many a family. That said, I know a lot of folks (some who are ex-designers) who make a respectable salary via other less traditional creative pursuits — baking, crafts, jewelry

The title of this rant is perhaps a bit much. As a few of you have said, libraries) over time is the only way to see if something really interests you enough to make a career of it. ",,False,,t5_2qmtk,True,,

The included bleed area has been rendered useless

To be honest, PDF and send it to the printer with our own marks anyway.  When the ad comes from a client who can't get the file fixed by their creative agency in time, I'm usually stuck with having to clone everything out.  If it can be fixed by the client, it means extra work on their end and getting closer to the deadline.

&amp;nbsp;

**Everybody thinks they're a brand designer.**

Okay, like when that individual is *a brand designer*. But often it's a web designer or graphic designer pinning brand design on their vest because they don't mind making a logo or some stationery or whatever, in addition to doing up websites or illustrations or whatever your real niche is.

&amp;nbsp;

**Please stop that.**

I get it, and be one of those full monty design guys to attract clients who need it all... But stop saying you ""do brand design."" You can make logos, or pick out colors, even put those logos and colors on a business card template for your client, okay, but *that is not brand design*.

A brand is so much more than the logo, **disingenuous** at worst. Hell, I'd even caution folks not to be a logo designer unless branding is what they're really going for. A logo is just a pretty flair at the top right of that website without a brand to support it, or be built around it, or for it to represent. 

It also leaves clients either misinformed or with unclear expectations. *Especially* if they know what a brand really is. None of us want more misinformed and mislead clients in our future. Be honest for yourself

If you find yourself at this point thinking to yourself ""*oh yeah buddy? Well what's brand design then?*"" then that resentment you feel should be a cue to double check that you're actually pretty sure you know what brand design is and could define it to a client thoroughly. If you can't articulate the lengthy research and labor that goes into brand design long before anyone says the word ""logo

&amp;nbsp;

**Note:**

The response to this, learn it first!

I could spend hours poring over work by Jessica Hische and all those other design rockstars, despite all the inspiration on the internet, I can't seem to spur into action. I get discouraged and lazy instead of inspired. I keep thinking I can't compare to these other people. It's going to take too long to get there. Regardless, I want to try.

I WOULD LOVE to create some cool side projects of my own, I'm lacking the drive to make stuff once my 9-5 is over. Sometimes I have freelance client work after hours, but again it's pretty corporate &amp; I dread doing it (but they're a good client, so I have to). (I'll be honest — even when I didn't have a full schedule, I still lacked drive to make cool things, even if I obsessed over other peoples' work for hours).

By the time the weekend comes around, or play with my cats.

But I feel like I'm severely missing out. Like, be a part of the movers and shakers. But I am a corporate nobody in an unfriendly, crappy city with not much of a design community.

There's a few different schools of letterpress -- those who use computers to produce photopolymer plates from which to print, producing entire lines of cast type ready for the press. It adds an element of ""holy crap, this could seriously injure me"" to graphic design.

Comparing my letterpress setup to a computer setup, and each choice weighs around 40 pounds. My backspace key is permanently broken, and sometimes my keyboard sprays molten metal at my legs.

Of particular interest to me is my Linotype

Time to get to the point… I have been made are of a 93 year old Linotype in Seattle that is homeless, but nobody could be located. Not willing to give up, I started an Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds needed to go and rescue the machine. My intention is to give it a home until a proper home can be found. I already own a Linotype, and a second isn't too high on my want list right now.

1. I'm born and raised in Eastern Europe where the living standard is pretty fucking shitty and where the graphic design industry has been non existent ""professionally"" until recently. 
2. I'm a duel citizen of a ""western"" country where I was lucky enough to spend lots of years of my life and I know the misconceptions that can arise from stating a salary without any context to people living in shittier countries.
3. I'm currently back in my home country working as an in-house graphic/web designer and would like to put things in perspective for all members of this subreddit


Anyway

I'm 3 years in the industry. I specialize in print design. I make 600 euros a month. The average salary in my country is 300 euros!. 

With said 600 euros I give 200 euros for rent(average price), I make double the average salary in my country! Most graphic designers here make 250 - 300 euros!! I consider myself to be lucky living the life I am currently.

My request to all members here is this: 

Don't just state your salary but put it in context so people could get a feel for what's that worth. When someone says ""I make 96

Because of this, as per above in this post. That way we might be able to find someone who would definitely be able to answer any questions.

3) A good graphic designer can put the message before themselves. Chances are, asshole. Watch the shows they watch, listen to their music. Communicate with your client and ask them questions! Have you seen that Mel Gibson Movie ""What Women Want""? It's an extreme example but basically Mel's character is an advertising director given the power to go into the mind of women. Do that.

After about a week working through concepts that I felt fit what she wanted, but big enough to where it wasn't going to be consistent. I advised against doing it but she kept pushing so I eventually agreed and did another redesign. Now this is where everything went kaput with me.

Should I have taken another route?

[Here is a screenshot of the server at work and how my folders are stacked](http://i.imgur.com/bUKrH.jpg)

You can see that we start off with just a general ""Art"" folder, furthermore, if you go into folder ""A"" for example, you will see all the clients, who's business name starts with an ""A"" This is crucial. You absolutely want to keep your stuff sorted by client name as that is how your memory works. It doesn't remember PO# 32489 from August of 2009, this is the reasoning behind spelling everything out. Once you get to the client folder, it breaks down even farther.

I break down my clients creative folders into 4 different sections.

1. WIP (Work in Progress) This is where I keep all of my layered .psd or .tiff or whatever file I am working on. If I am building a magazine, so its _v1.psd, _v2.psd and so on. If it's a complete design overhaul, sometimes I will create a new folder inside WIP that says something like ""Revised July 27th - New layouts"" or something of that nature to let me know the entire design changed in style. Also, say I am doing a whole creative campaign for say Chevy, then inside the WIP I would have folders for each car name &gt; Volt, Malibu

2. Orig (Original art) This is where all of the files the client have given me are stored. This is also where I keep all of my references or parts to files. THESE ARE NEVER, stock photos, fonts, color palettes (colorlovers) vector stocks etc.

3. Proof - This is self explanatory. If I am showing my proofs in a InDesign template, named with version extensions _v2_Proof.PDF or _v3_Proof.PDF so that I know what the last version was that was approved.

4. Final - Again

I've just received a negative performance review at work. While my first review went fairly well

Background: I work at a startup and I'm the only designer. Prior to this, its harder to motivate yourself)...because I know the impact it could have on my resume IF I do a great job. My job is split in half, half doing branding graphics work, half doing product work. On a typical day, I'm kept fairly busy between the two sides. I switched to design from another career because I truly thought my passion lies in something creative...and now I'm unsure of myself. 

The general feedback was: You have the skills, and you haven't even started on a style guide yet. I'm also responsible for helping to redesign their product - a HUGE task and one that I'm kind of nervous about. I haven't initiated doing that either. You clearly have the skills to do the job, but you aren't taking any initiative to improve things.

I saw it coming. The first few months of this job, settling for designs that work. I used to do fun projects on the side to learn, and now I stopped doing it altogether. I know - an unmotivated designer is essentially a dead designer given how competitive this industry is. Its BAD. Is it because I'm the only designer (do other designers here have the same problem?) Or is it really just me, and I'm not passionate or motivated about design enough? How do you stay passionate?

I found out a while back that I was incorrectly naming colors, I definitely *did* have color blindness. Basically reds, greens, and browns ('earth tones') are the ones I have trouble telling apart at different shades and mixtures.

As a designer, and in an already super competitive field, I now feel at a huge disadvantage. I also feel guilty for not being honest and upfront about my 'disability', fearing that I won't ever find work again. I hesitate with everything, and I don't know if I'm naming any of the right colors at this point (Is that orange or red-orange? Dark blue or teal? Etc, etc). I hadn't realized at how much I actually relied on this ability, until I lost it.

I was told, especially with men. So that's why I'm reaching out here. Is anyone here in the same position? How are you dealing with it? Are you still designing? Are there any tricks you use to aid your work, or a way you would recommend to re-learn colors?

Any advice would be *really* appreciated

What I normally _don't_ give up are the PSD or AI files.

This recently came up when I did a digital painting/logo for a website's header.

Here is what was said...

&gt;The other thing I was emailing about was to ask for the source of the header. I know you are ambivalent about giving it, and graphics) it is proprietary material and doesn't get shared with anyone that is not authorized.
&gt;
&gt;The primary reason is that my brother is a design student and had some feedback that I would like to experiment with. Its not something I really want to pay extra time for since it may end up going nowhere

What I said back.

&gt;I don't want this to become a sore spot between us, there is normally a premium; as the artist is, from then on, obsolete.
&gt;
&gt;This very principle is betrayed where you say ""If you are worried about me sharing the source with other designers do not be worried""... and then... ""my brother is a design student and had some feedback that I would like to experiment with"". I hope you can see how that would undermine the very nature of the work that I do.

My answer is and always will be yes. Well

I worked 15 - 20 hours a week as a designer in the Continuing Education department of my university creating a few catalogs

My first hard and fast lesson, although each project had an objective, I was graded more on the ability to take the task at hand and come up with a “baffle them with bullshit” interpretation. It was always the more emotional or self/world-analytical idea that trumped the clear, concise, purpose driven one. If your school(s) are anything like the ones around my area, this still seems to be the case and is a disservice to the percentage of students who want a steady income with benefits. In the working world, most designers will end up answering to clients, although the lifeblood of our industry are huge dicks that fail to see the effort in your work. When dealing with clients, and flashier, resulting in the loss of your job

Most people are going to choose the latter. I hope. But this is something worth learning as early as possible. Don’t get me wrong, six images, four callouts and is due to the publication in an hour.

* 2)  Is the career path really that awful? I've literally read people tonight saying how it's one of the worst careers they've ever entered in.
 
* 3)  How much is the *pay?* (Keep in mind, just curious.) I've heard people say 'You will need two jobs' But then I hear people say 'Stop doing logos for $1000' Surely $1000+ for a logo would be decent enough pay?

* 4)  Are there any books on typography / Illustrator / Cinema4d / Photoshop out there any of you would recommend? I've been saving my money lately for a new TV

* 5)  When did you get into graphics design? Was it in middle school? high school? College? I'm genuinely curious!

A little about myself, but do a lot of graphic design on the side and for the shop. I was asked a few weeks ago by a local guidance councilor to have a few kids come shadow me for the day.

Fast forward to today: Just remembered I have these kids coming in tomorrow

I figure I can talk to them about my past and how I got where I am, share a few stories, grab some lunch, show them some of the tools I use everyday, etc. After that, I'm not sure what to talk to them about concerning graphic design...

What are some things I can talk about with these kids about? What is some stuff you wish someone had told you about in high school? I'm struggling for ideas at this point! I don't want to screw these kids up and make them think the career path is lame! Any help would be awesome! Thanks

When I say 'graphic designers' I don't mean students or people who play with photoshop in their spare time.. I mean people who actually have fulltime jobs or maybe freelance fulltime in design. This is because in my opinion it's completely different to being a student or doing it as a hobby.

I graduated from design and luckily (and because I worked hard at it) got a job within two months. I'm now working 40 hours a week as a graphic designer and have been for about 3 months

1. How do you cope with sitting at a desk for 40 hours a week straining on a screen? I like using computers, to make tea, get water, have a chat, go to the printer etc (while working hard of course). I also try and do exercises while sitting at my desk, like sitting in lotus position on my chair and doing foot rolls. It still doesn't feel it's enough. Not to be a debbie downer, but today I happened to read [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/confirmed-he-who-sits-the-most-dies-the-soonest/256101/) article. How do you guys feel about this aspect of the job? Any advice for me in 5 years, etc?

2. Something I'm sure most entry level graphic designers can agree on is that the pay is pretty low. In addition to this, it's all done by the book because I've looked it up. I am still managing to save so it's not a life or death situation but I have higher expectations of how much I want to save. So I'm considering getting a second job as a waitress - this means more exercise on my feet, no sitting in front of a computer, more talking to people and an additional wage. Has anyone else worked a second job with graphic design being their fulltime wage? Waitering, bartending, painting, poker pro-ing on the side, I need balance.

And this really isn't supposed to come across as a whiny post. I feel hugely lucky I even got a job in the field and am really liking it. I'm also doing really well and am picking everything up quickly which is great. No job is perfect but I still like to critique and address the issues I do have.

**New Sidebar

With the new sidebar our goal will be clarifying information for novice designers and fleshing out the rules of the subreddit. 

One thing that will be removed is critiques. There is already a subreddit for design critiques. It's a fine community and they deserve your usage. Critique requests garner very little karma (1-5

That is not to say you can't submit critiques of high-profile work by designers other than yourself

We'll continue to keep the comments section as free as possible

I am currently compiling an FAQ for amateur designers and that will be made available shortly. Once this is in place there will be restrictions on posts asking the questions it will be answering.

The new rules will apply from today on.

**Updated Vision for the Subreddit**

We don't want to be an unfriendly or authoritarian subreddit. We do aspire to raise the quality to that of a professional online design magazine. We want this to be a place for the following:  

* Discussions of ground-breaking work and high-profile work.  

* Examples of great design, just design that falls short, use your knowledge).  

* Tips, design movements, trends, professionalism, careers and technology (digital or craft).  

So in future, there's not much we can do. We want this place to be better for everyone, amateur and professional.

**New Look:**

I was always the creative one in my family, messing around in an old version of Paint Shop Pro, or teaching myself basic code as I made Xanga blog layouts. I was curious, and excited about design. 

I went to post-secondary right after High School. It was a small college, my instructors were fantastic, and I found my creativity definitely peaked while I was there.

I have since completed college, and even that habit is long gone. I don't feel as creative as I was in college, or even before. 

I don't know whether it was design school that broke me, and the people here are great. But I dread coming to work every morning.

Some of the projects are interesting, you have no choice. I don't want to blame my place of work for my lack of creativity.

1335444776.0,sth6u,Anyone interested in joining a /r/graphic_design IRC channel?,champ-ooh,32,8,11,"Hey graphic_design

pretty much whenever I have my computer running I'm on irc. There's a wide variety of channels but I've never really been able to find one where design is discussed. I've asked the mods for permission and they're fine with me trying to start a channel for this subreddit.

For those who know what IRC is

**For those who don't know what IRC is here's a quick run-through:**

[IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) Is an entirely textbased chatprotocol and usually consists of a server where users can host their own channels. The irc network I created the channel ##reddit-gd on is [freenode](http://freenode.net/).

Freenode offers a [webbased chat to connect to ##reddit-gd](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23reddit-gd) but I would recommend using a proper [IRC Client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients). As IRC is textbased and hellishly ugly by default you can improve the interface of simple clients like [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) (Windows Only) with add-ons  like [nbs-irc](http://nbs-irc.net/) or use other clients like [chatzilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatZilla) (Firefox Addon - Crossplatform)

Mac users can connect to IRC with [Adium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adium) or [Pidgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin_\(software\)).

I've never seen a Linux user who doesn't know IRC but Pidgin

As soon as you have downloaded the client and worked your way through the settings you can connect to the server irc.freenode.org Port: 6667 (or 7000 for ssl) and join the channel ##reddit-gd. 

A last small warning: Don't expect to join for 5 minutes and have the greatest in depth discussion of your life. Most IRC users idle all day and really just reply/talk when the current topic is interesting and they feel like they can contribute. Just joining the irc channel and asking a question Google could solve in 2 minutes is shunned upon and will usually make no one want to reply. IRC is more like your usual fb/gmail IM where you talk to people once a day but stay online for 24/7.

//Edit: Feel free to ask if there's any problem with configuring your client or joining the channel.

Also make sure to join **##reddit-gd** it's two #.",,t5_2qmtk,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/sth6u/anyone_interested_in_joining_a_rgraphic_design/

I feel like this might ruin adobe in the long run based on the fact their system has always been to remain popular as the ""industry standard"".

Students would ""buy"" their programs and because they were the most used by students they would go on to use their software professionally which led to its hold on the graphics industry in general.

With this new system they are essentially removing the ""planting the seed"" aspect of their formula and just banking on the idea that people won't bail out in an angry panic.

Maybe it has been done or maybe it is completely against most of your ethical principles. But if not

**SUBMISSIONS**

-----
Submissions would look like this:

* .jpg's, etc of portfolio
* position/contract/job *offered* based on portfolio:
* salary/compensation:
* city or region:

All data parts would be optional for participants that were uncomfortable giving out that information. Even some entries without portfolios could possibly be valuable to determine current market conditions in different areas.

Submissions would be made to a single volunteer compiler. I'm down

The results would be compiled and probably uploaded to an imgur album unless someone wants to make something cool out of them. Since portfolios contain multiple pieces

**ETHICS**

-----
Everything would be anonymized. Feel free to do so yourself before submitting but even if you don't, race, all of that equal opportunity stuff, and anything that could be explicitly identifying will be left out. For example if you say, “I offered this guy $1000 for a magazine ad: johncena-g-designer.com!” then the compiler person would just go to a site and select the best work there (excluding any personal logos or what have you) and enter that along with “magazine ad: $1000”

I would think employers AND employees could submit. (Here's a persons's portfolio to whom I offered this job versus here's my portfolio for which I was offered this job.) Maybe the employ**ers** should stick to portfolios that are available publicly so as not to breach the trust of privately submitted work.


**GOALS**

-----
Ultimately this would give everyone some perspective. Of course many jobs are not solely earned on portfolios. networking, but “portfolio quality” is subjective anyway. Students who think they'll never make it might see some stuff on their level that made some decent cash. Or managers/supervisors could realize they've been under or overpaying. It would even be cool to just see the portfolios of the crowd here, data aside.

The more people that participate the better. I don't get any karma if you upvote this to get more people to see.

The older co-workers are 'stuck in their ways' of things and of which some are right and some are wrong.

I was working on an advert today in InDesign and numerous versions were to be created. Each version uses the same image and logo/type placement. My logical way of building this document was to place everything on the master page and then change the copy of the headline and body. This saved me a fair amount of time and ensured all placements of objects were in the correct spots and had consistency. 

My creative director (3 titles above me) wanted to make a tweak to the document and hadn't realized I had the image on the master page. They became frustrated and asked another co-worker (two titles above me) what was going on and they had to trouble shoot that it was a master page element.

I was told not to use master pages because not everyone knows how to use them. This concerns me that I have my bosses boss not knowing how to use the software complaining and making me look like I'm in the wrong. Am I? Or am I in the right to use such a feature that saves time which makes me more efficient (where I work efficiency is supposedly highly valued). 

I want to seek outside input on how to go about handling this situation because I truly feel that using the master pages feature is rudimentary knowledge for InDesign and should be utilized whenever possible that would save time.

I wanted to pursue my education further so I’m currently working on my Bachelors in Advertising and Studio Art (Double Major) to fill in the holes that my Associates left out. I had it set in stone that this was going to be my life

I’ve done the freelance thing, or rather it’s something I no longer wish to pursue because its taken a negative impact on my life.

This idea is mostly due to the fact that dealing with clients and my boss in regards to designing has left me feeling incredibly frustrated everyday. I know dealing with said people is part of the job and there’s no way to get around it

What's happened now is that all the creativity and inspiration has just been sucked out of me. Designing has become a chore, just an empty feeling that leaves me staring at a blank InDesign document.

So I graduate in December and I’ve come to the conclusion that what I enjoyed was the innovation

Now the big question is what do I do with all this education and training? How can I transition from Graphic Designer to something else? How do I market these skills to take my career in a different direction? I ask you wonderful people of reddit if you have any experience or advice that could send me in a new direction. Any ideas for jobs or areas of interest that I can focus on? I know no job is perfect, I’m really facing a daunting life change.


**tl;dr** - Spent six years wanting to be a Graphic Designer

***update*** -  I appreciate all the outpouring of support, and that I just need to find inspiration to keep me going. I just don't feel like this is the right path for me, but I don't want to waste all the time and money I sank into school and jobs

***Update 02/07/2013***
*Apparently people are still finding this

Wow

Thanks for all the support and kind words, such as doing book layout and cover illustration, real easy stuff.

I received nothing besides ""we regret to inform you"" messages, and my state (New Mexico) is ranked among the highest for unemployment, and ranks lowest in new job creation. I've applied to jobs in other states but with no luck because I figure most are trying to hire local and quickly. I also have the added disadvantage of looking like some 21-22 yr old kid who just graduated, because I indeed did just graduate. What doesn't carry through is that I'm 27, which may not seem like a big deal but it can work in my advantage that I'm older and possibly have more experience than a typical recent grad, and indeed I do have more experience than most of my graduating class in the same fields.

**End of story now;** I ran out of savings to live off of and just need to pay bills

Is this what I had in mind when I set out to push myself in school? No, friends who care for me, I realized I'm in the same situation as many of my peers and people with much more skill than me. I think if I just work hard, show people what I can do, open my mind to different possibilities as far as a career, then I'll be fine. I'm optimistic about the future, even if its not my dream job.

I don't have much experience designing yet, and I recognize it presents an entirely different set of boundaries, challenges, and patronage; but am interested in your opinions.  Is it possible to straddle these divergent fields in one's practice?  Wayne Thiebaud did it; can you think of other artists/designers who can with good conscience say they do both?

I am looking for some insight on the future of graphic design and how it can affect my career.

Currently, and unsure how to proceed. Ideally I want a steady paycheck for a few more years to build some equity before I eventually transition to freelance.

I am a solid print and identity designer. I want to leave the in-house work and go to an agency

I have the option to go freelance, but that will take some time (6 months living expense in San Francisco, yikes). This is what I eventually want to do with my career, I just feel I should get more experience before I do so.

I also see the growing trend of UI/UX designers, for which I have very little except a rudimentary understanding of HTML and CSS.

So this is my question: Should I do what I do best right now and stick with print
