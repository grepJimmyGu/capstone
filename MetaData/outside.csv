When I asked in general chat, overall I like the results anyway.

Now here's the part that makes you realize just how shitty this game's community can be. As soon as players around me noticed I changed my gender, no one roleplays with me etc, basically a ton of players are calling me a sploiter and giving me grief over it. I'm getting a lot of PvP duel requests too. 

This is absolutely ridiculous. I've read the TOS and there seem to be no specific rules against what I did and it's mostly a cosmetic feature anyway. I know of players who, and no one seems to care as much about that, what's the big deal here? All I can say is, this can be pretty frustrating at times, and I just really hope the devs eventually either fix character creation or implement a proper gender change feature. As for the sad state of the community regarding this, there's not much to say, a lot of them just put you on their ignore list if you try talking to them :/

There's been a bug for millions of years now where dying in-game bans your account permanently. It can't be that hard to fix, but I digress. The bug makes PvP about the worst idea in the world, and many players will take it upon themselves to punish you for it.

The game is so buggy that players have been able to use exploits to get to areas that no one was intended to be. A few players have actually gotten to the moon

* I love the open world aspects of the game; I've never played anything where there's been quite so much freedom (especially when you're just starting out). It's taken a while to get used to the areas which are only accessible at certain times of day, so I have to choose one or the other - what's with that?

* Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck, it'll probably be useful at some point (but be careful because the NPC guards will stop you ""stealing"" things!), and you can sometimes get great results by using combinations of things (for example, I tried imbibing a potion of drunkenness and then wearing a traffic cone the other day, and I'm pretty sure it gave me an invisibility buff: no matter how much I sang, everybody ignored me!). Inventory management is a bit of a pain, but picking up a rucksack has really helped.

* Not so impressed with the NPCs. I've learned that the best approach to getting information and quests is to talk to everybody,"" ""Stop bothering me,"" etc.). I've tried offering things for trade, but most of them aren't interested in my traffic cone or my crayons or my rucksack: I'm honestly not sure what most of them are for!

* Anyway: I know that some of you must have been down this quest track, to see if they'd give me strength (one of the NPCs here suggested it), but it doesn't work. The doctors are a seriously creepy monster, by the way - they keep talking about you having ""delusions"" or something - but I'm sure there's a way to get back to the main quest track.

First of all, and there's an astonishingly low miss chance, defense rating and practically nulled Perception stat on sleeping characters. Additionally, even if you are awakened when attacked, you will be inflicted with the Dazed debuff, Drowsy debuff, and most likely even the Panic debuff. Not good for countering unexpected PvP. Now, as PvP is discouraged in most regions

Then there's the amount of time you have to spend in sleep mode. For proper prevention of Drowsy debuffs you need to spend almost one third of the time in this state. That's way too long. Since each character has a total play time limit, train 30% more stats, spend 30% more time on the various other activities in the game, *per character*.

I mentioned above that the Drowsy debuffs tend to hit regions in a pattern. Most players will know the map is a sphere and night travels around it, so they went and added the Jetlag debuff, which as a side effect, fucks up every character who quick-travels to a new region for a couple of in-game days. I mean come on, there have to be better ways to prevent exploits than punishing every character who travels.

The sleep mechanic seriously needs to be revised as soon as possible. Maybe even removed. I see why it's there but it causes serious problems with gameplay balance.",self,t5_2r3f3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/outside/comments/14l0jd/sleep_is_seriously_broken/

So, it was pretty well balanced.  For a reasonable fee, it provided a small 5 minute buff to [CHR] and [SOC], and increased your characters Stress Tolerance by +1 for about an hour.  However, not long after its introduction, (around v1880), players began noticing that it also applied a small stacking debuff to [STA], after enough stacks

Most players still considered the trade-offs worth it, even though the debuff eventually became  widely known, the devs never addressed the issue.

Then, confirming that the debuff was a balance feature, not a bug.  However, around the same time they fixed the tooltip, they also (accidentally?) REMOVED the [CHR] part of the buff.  In fact, there's some speculation that it in fact applies a [CHR] DEBUFF now, making your character unpopular.

This seems completely broken to me

My potential solutions:

* Find a way to remove the [Cancer] debuff from the item
* Revert the [CHR] changes back to their pre-patch v1975 setting
* Remove the item from the game entirely.  Most new players are instead using the [Pot] item now

First of all, if you use it on some of the best foods, you start to gain the fat debuff, and it stacks in intensity. For a little while, I started to get a couple stacks of the fat debuff, and it was really pwning my character. END and MOT (motivation) stats started dropping quickly. And it takes a lot of questing and grinding to get rid of the fat debuff, way harder than getting it. Why create good content like food if they're going to punish you for using it a lot?

Next, fun PvP, and exploration ops. But then after I already joined, I found out that the PvP servers don't have respawn, so I decided to do the air traffic control sidequest in the air force faction to lower my chances of getting killed in PvP. I figured that if I'm in a PvP server, rewards would be greater, but noooooo. I found out that people doing the ATC sidequest on regular servers were making about 2 or 3 times the gold that I was doing the same thing! Not to mention, where there is major frost damage if you stay outside too long. There was literally no point to PvP (I couldn't get into the whole realm pride thing) so when I dinged 25 I GTFO and am back in the regular server. Unfortunately getting into the ATC guild takes a long time

Lastly, and munchies, with a slight temporary debuff on critical thinking. What's wrong with that, especially if it is an item that the devs specifically put in the game, unlike meth crystals or something like that that is user-created. Not that I'm for banning alcohol pots or tobacco plants, but they have much worse debuffs. I just don't get the justification.

Also, but it really fucks up the current questlines with it's plotholes and it's just time for it to be patched out IMO...

If you made it this far, but game forums at least help you get that crap off of your mind.

TL;DR

Why fat debuff come with eating skill, so why keep it?

As you may know from others' descriptions

What this subreddit is meant to do is showcase real life

What it's turning into is people thinking that this is a game of Dungeons and Dragons, and that the world is merely another map for that sort of game.

I want to point out one submission that mostly embodies what I wish for this subreddit to be: http://www.reddit.com/r/outside/comments/16glju/face_it_guys_this_games_abandoned/

Note how it's written. It refers to the world as if it was a video game. It doesn't mention perks or buffs or anything most other games have. It has a discussion regarding it being a game, and speculation. I want this subreddit to go in that sort of direction. Not necessarily discussion-based, but more towards ""highlight stuff in life that would be amazing to have in a video game"" and not ""compare POPULARGAME to real life"".

I want this subreddit to go in a direction where /r/AskScience or /r/AskHistorians-like questions are regularly asked and answered in game terms. I want to have this subreddit show off stuff in real life that would be amazing to have in video games. I want it to show images that would make you think

On another note, mostly to homogenize the ""in-game terms"" used as well as provide guidelines for submissions. If anyone has any suggestions regarding what to add, or any suggestions to implement for this subreddit, that would be great.

So why does the economy have to dominate all the other aspects of the game?

Honestly devs, train my skills a bit, you know... just have fun. I **don't** want to build my character just to have a strong economy, I actually want to play the game. Instead of enjoying the game though, I have to grind *constantly* just to keep my character alive. Yeah, I know I can respec into the ""homeless"" class, but then I still have to grind for food AND I lose all my charisma. What the hell guys?

Here are some suggestions to fix this problem:

1. Nerf money. I get that the economy drives a lot of the gameplay, and all that encourages is mindless grinding.

2. Reduce the requirements for satiation. Why does the PC have to eat multiple times a day to avoid stat penalties? That literally does nothing to improve the game

3. Remove or heavily reduce the amount of sleep needed by the PC. That way at least I would ""only"" have to grind for a third of the game

4. Make exploring worthwhile. Do you know how many treasure chests I've found? Zero. I've explored *huge* areas

5. More quests! I know that almost every NPC and every other player I encounter in the world has problems they're trying to solve, quests would provide the player with a way to get gold without mindless grinding.

I looked into it

Here's where it gets complicated.

I recently discovered through discussions with other players that the members of the *NSA* sub-faction of the *US Government* faction are actually violating a rule of the **Constitution of the United States**.  They've found an exploit where they can listen to all of your private messages in the game

The **Constitution of the United States** rule they're breaking by reading our private messages is called ""The 4th Amendment"" and it reads as such:
&gt; The right of the players to be secure in their persons, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and the players or things to be seized.

I contacted a few members of the *NSA* faction to let them know they were breaking some rules.  First, I did a little research and the **USA PATRIOT Act** is only a *Rare* item, so the **Constitution of the United States** should override this.

I'm not sure where to go next to advance this quest line.  I'm supposed to uphold the **Constitution of the United States** but my own faction members are working against it

It seems all you can do in the current version is send satellites and robots into space or or mars but there is no way of going past the edge of space. Even then

This is a work in progress so Player (you) suggestions are always welcome.

Some other notable tutorials are the bible, Buddhism and many more. But like with most players they are very into the role playing aspect of this game. And a few have written fan fiction tutorials( read above).

lets start off with what OUTSIDE (from here on out known as OS) really is: OS is the largest MMO ever made. Over 7 (close to 8) billion people play this game EVERY DAY. A lot of people rage quit when they die but hey that's their business.

What makes this game so great IMO is the lack of actual ""rules"" other than physics and calculus. [Found here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) [and here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus). There are some player made rules called ""laws"" but this depends on what faction you created your character in or joined later on.

(BTW [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a great source of information on some of the games past and item descriptions.) [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_world) is a brief description on what happened so far.

So this game causes as much, their are no save files, no single player mode (not really), DMG takes waaaay too long to heal, emotional DMG takes longer, skills are very difficult to train, and when you hit lvl 35; your stats start do decrease! I could go on and on

So your base starts are invisible but can be heavily modified by ""will""

Stats i have found so far: Will, Wisdom, Speed, Language, Dex (different than speed), Resistance, stamina, charisma, Weight

So in an Ideal build you want max of (almost) all of those but that's not possible. If given an option i'd put points into INT, SOC, and RES (For longer play time).

Early game you're pretty much forced to grind a base stat base from scratch. In most if not all of those categories. (Power through it

Controls are shit to get used to but you'll get the hang of it.

Now this game has a way of ""forcing"" you to dev certain skills as a means of success. But listen to the higher lvl players as to what to do

So lets skip a bit because learning the game by yourself is most of the fun really.

SKILL TREES: This is a HUGE subject and i can't possible get into it all. Personally i would recommend 1 of 2 paths because they link into the job trees. The economic path or the Personal Fulfillment path. Now these are both difficult

With the economic path you have to find and train skills that are sometimes morally ""gray"" ( Unless you took a religious perk, it ruins the game for everyone) Now this path Gains you a lot of money, but most often decreases your happiness. Some of the Higher level players said they wish they'd taken the personal fulfillment path. Does money = happiness? Sometimes. But money does = buying power.

Personal fulfillment attempts to max out your happiness

Now the skills you need for each depends on your characters base stats, and current position in game. Good core stats are Health, Charisma, INT, WIS, SOC, and PAT. I've found that a good combo of those work fine in almost any situation so increase those and dont be a dick.

THE DEVS: Now these guys dont release ANY info to the fans. They are DICKS. They made disease, and inflamed sciatica. I didn't think the health stat was that important, I WAS WRONG. Can't say much about the Devs because not much is known about them. Mostly fan fiction and rumors.

Diseases (from Sam_Strong): With regards to the disease debuffs, seem to ignore the HP and RES stats (Such as some classes of the cancer debuff). There seems to be a semi-random chance ( that increases with level) of acquiring these. Research into the lore that deals with these debuffs, and practicing the removal spells , while time consuming, is a great way of levelling the Healer skill path, as well as giving significant boosts to the INT stat. For those who gain high enough levels, or complete the Doctor guild quest line there are even significant GP bonus.

END GAME: By this time unless your character died from any number of things (hopefully not!) and depending on your play style; you either have kids, Alone, sad, happy, any number of things. Just remember that WILL and WIS should have been taken earlier to avoid any undesirable endings.

Now Every character dies (sadly) and no one is really sure what happens. But that isn't the point. And IMHO that isn't the point of the game. The point was that you accomplished what you set out to do and either you were happy doing it

Now the FanFic writers may be angry with me, you weren't going to get it the second time.

SOME ADVICE: In current game going the job path usually requires quest item 'Degree' So get one of those

See doctor often to avoid de-buffs (worth it if you're planning on going till late game)

Don't be a dick! Its a multilayer game after all

Rumors have it that Buddhism offers second play-though. Mostly fan fic and rumors tho. But they offer the Dont be a dick advice as well.

Thanks for reading my tutorial! and advice and changes are welcome!

Back in the day there was a really strong faction called [ROME] it had some of the highest military stats to date and some of the strongest players on its server

Then came this one character who at a very low level cap won a huge series of raids in the [GAUL] server his name was Julius Caesar. Coming back from his victories with a [GREAT GENERAL] title as well as some personal achievements for his server such as the [GAIN PROVINCE] [DEFEAT FACTION: GAULS] and explored an unknown territory [BRITANNIA].

Unfortunately several high ranking players in the faction especially those in the [SENATE] guild decided he might be becoming OP and asked him to disband his legions and share his loot. Caesar refused and changed the way his server ran forever by marching into [ROME] and taking full voting power. He did this without causing a [RIOT] reaction by hiding his title from most of the players.

Eventually though a group of players from the [SENATE] guild attacked him when he was unarmed and didn't have a party to protect him including his [TANK] Mark Antony

And shining morning face

Unwillingly to trainer. And then the roleplayer

Made to his mistress' eyebrow.

Full of strange metagames and bearded like the pard

Jealous in honour

Seeking the leaderboard reputation

Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the mentor

In fair round belly with good capon lined

With eyes severe and beard of formal cut

Full of wise saws and modern instances;

And so he plays his part. 

The sixth age shifts

Into the lean and slipper'd 

With spectacles on nose and pouch on side

His youthful hose

For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice

Turning again toward childish treble

Hmm...

take total age devide by 10 round down and add first number of age. Where first number must be between 0-9

    Lvl 21 = 21/10 + 2 = 2 +2 = 4
    Lvl 15 = 15/10 + 1 = 1 +1 = 2
    Lvl 09 = 9/10 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0
    lvl 45 = 45/10 + 4 = 8
    lvl 82 = 16
    lvl 105 =11

This way skills peaks at the 100+ while still benefitting continuing the motif that high level players must make room for the next gen. As most players peak around 70-80 this will provably be the max range of bonus.
