1248424080.0,944fx,HellMOO: Post-apocalyptic MUD,jswhitten,11,2,3,"Does the sound of a Fallout-esque game in text based form intrigue you? If so

There was a time when you were young. You ran through green fields, one day out of the clear blue sky, atomic fire came and burned your old life away. Before you even knew why, before you could even pick through the smoking rubble of your life, bury the scorched bones of your family, the fighting began.

Survivor turned on survivor, a stolen can of food here, a knife fight there. You discovered something within yourself, a hidden reserve of willpower that refused to let you sit down in the desert and die.

As you wandered, grew larger, developing self-sustaining economies, even corporations and technologies. Gleaming steel in the great quiet dark of the desert, they offer a moment of respite from your wanderings. But everywhere the desert remains, a sea of sand and bones. It is hungry, and it is patient.

The survivor in you knows it is only a matter of time before you must face it again.

HellMOO is a post-apocalyptic hellscape role-playing game. Imagine a city filled with people who have nothing to lose, and angry. Add to that hideous, unthinkable abominations that are the product of irresponsible genetics research and generations of radiation poisoning and pollution. Now imagine that multinational corporations are the only organizations cutthroat enough to have come out of the collapse of civilization with any real collective power, and that there are now no restrictions on them using that power however they like.

There are so many ways to die here
