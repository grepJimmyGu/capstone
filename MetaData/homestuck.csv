&gt;
&gt;TLDR; Act 6 Act 6 is next. This is Homestuck's final push. But before I start on it
&gt;
&gt;4/13/13 marked the 4th year of Homestuck
&gt;
&gt;The idea last year was to finish Homestuck and then begin working on the game. But as I've started to get into the early game dev process a bit, either I delay finishing Homestuck by a few months, or delay the release of the game by what would probably be a lot longer than that. Considering people threw 2.5 million bucks at me to make a game, I think that choice is obvious. 
&gt;
&gt;If I could do both at the same time
&gt;
&gt;I have noticed that some people believed HS would end on 4/13/13, right? I can't make those without suspending all updates completely for a good while. Trust me, the end to this won't sneak up on anyone. It will be really obvious when it's on the way. 
&gt;
&gt;To alleviate some of the suspense and wild speculation, as organized by this really awesome ""html table"" I have designed for this purpose.
&gt;
&gt;The thing I am going to be doing|How long that thing is going to take me
&gt;:---|---:
&gt;Work on the game, also go to a few conventions. No updates.|Months
&gt;Work on a whole bunch of regular updates for A6A6
&gt;Work on the final animation
&gt;
&gt;So that's it for now. See you in a while. Unless you decide to reread Homestuck or something. In which case I guess I'll keep seeing you here. Well not me,False,self,t5_2rzgi,False,,biznasty,t3_1cbk4y

But even though they've been upvoted a lot, since this is *your* community, I thought I'd put it to a vote.

[So here

Answer now

EDIT: Lots of input, etc.)

**EDIT 2:** Uhh, but I've never gotten more than 50 or so responses. It turns out that if you get more than 100 responses, Surveymonkey expects you to pay 25 bucks or so for a monthly gold license so you can view the rest of the responses. So I'm at an impasse here, as I don't have the disposable income to throw at this paywall. (Paying for a service? What sort of unsustainable bullshit business model is that?)

So here's the deal. I'm probably going to have to remake the poll on a different website in a little while because I don't think that 25 bucks is worth it even if we have like some fucking fundraiser bullshit or something.

*ANYWAY*

**EDIT 3:** The survey has been remade using Obsurvey and not Surveymonkey. Use this link

This is to help us cope with the MEGAPAUSE as well as to have us all go back and see if we missed anything. With an epic as convoluted as Homestuck

I am going to give us a new page to read to and make a discussion thread for the previous assignment every Saturday

**Okay

That's just a bit over 200 pages

**EDIT:** I should probably say that I'm going slowly on purpose

**EDIT II:** It seems like a few people also want to read Problem Sleuth and other older works from Hussie

1349554693.0,1120ur,MSPAssistant: a new way to read Homestuck that needs your help!,banjaloupe,160,20,36,"Hello fellow Homestucks!

Over the past month or so my friend /u/video_game and I have been working on a large Homestuck-related project that might be of interest to you

""MSPAssistant is a userscript that helps new and longtime readers navigate the tangled plotlines, MSPAssistant allows for quick keyboard navigation through tagged pages of the story.
What do we mean by tags? Each page is marked with characters, and MSPAssistant allows you to easily ""track"" these tags, visiting pages only where those tags appear. This lets you read Homestuck in entirely new ways-- you can quickly check the last time you saw an important item, read pages containing only your favorite character, or skip forward to pages only where something is dead (seriously).""

**[Screenshot of how it looks on MSPA](http://mspassistant.vdoga.me/mspashot.png)**

Current features:

* Keyboard navigation

    * Arrow keys: forward/back
    * P: expand/collapse pesterlog
    * Shift+Arrow keys: skip to beginning/end (first/last page with the tag)
    * Alt-C/Opt-C: Override page style to simple white/grey theme ([example](http://i.imgur.com/WEuhn.png)

* Appearance customization options

    * Bar on top or bottom
    * Show page number in title
    * Keyboard shortcuts enabled/disabled
    * Shadow enabled/disabled
    * Check for updates

* Tag tracking

* Tag selection (dropdown menu and selection page)

* Arrow key navigation automatically disabled on walkaround pages

* AND/OR tag mode


Sounds cool, seeing what we've done by ourselves so far, want to help us make it even better! Basically, this just involves rereading parts of Homestuck (as if you weren't gonna do this already) and writing down what characters appear, where they are, what they're wearing, any visual callbacks, on a Google Docs spreadsheet (you can get more details by going to r/MSPAssistant).

With enough of us working together, or you have some free time, check out the [MSPAssistant page](http://mspassistant.vdoga.me/) or the shiny new /r/MSPAssistant subreddit to talk with us and learn more. We are very serious about getting Homestuck tagged and we hope we've piqued your interest in doing the same!

--/u/banjaloupe &amp; /u/video_game
