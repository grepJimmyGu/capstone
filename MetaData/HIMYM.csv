At this point

This is my comprehensive guide -- Why all that crazy shit that happened actually makes a whole lotta sense.  

---

**PART I: HOW I ~~MET~~ YOUR MOTHER**

To understand the season finale

The story of how Ted meets the mother of his future children is simple and incidental -- he meets her at his friend's wedding because it's raining and she has a distinctive yellow umbrella.  He could have met her at the St. Patrick's day party.  He could have met her in Econ class.  He could have met her when he dated her roommate.  It doesn't matter.  

What matters is at those points in the story

So to understand how he becomes emotionally prepared to do that

It's Robin.  

&gt;Victoria:  There is a reason that it didn’t work out between you and me

&gt;Ted: No.

&gt;Victoria:  Yes. She is so much bigger in your world than you realize. 

*""How I Met Your Mother"" is not about ""how I met your mother

So how *does* Ted get over Robin?  Well...

---

**PART II: BARNEY AND ROBIN**  

Barney and Robin are two main characters on the show.  We, one dimensional characters -- Barney is no more than a simple player looking to get laid as much as humanly possible, and Robin is an independent, career-oriented woman looking to make it big in New York City.  As the show progresses, we gain more insight into their true personalities.  Turns out, they both have their fears and insecurities.  They both have problems with commitment and abandonment, stemming from their daddy issues.  

In a lot of ways, hard work, and struggle.  They broke up because in reality, neither of them could handle a serious relationship at that time.  

They kept trying, they always cared for each other.  

&gt;Barney: I can't have any single female friends around
- Season 6

&gt; Robin (in truth voice): I wish Barney were my boyfriend again. (back to regular voice) No thanks.
Lily: Wait a minute
- Season 7

By season 7, the kind of chemistry that doesn't go away.  The only other thing they need, she says, is timing.  So the scene is set for Barney and Robin to get back together, but in good storytelling fashion, the writers decided to throw a bunch of other obstacles in the way of their relationship in Season 7 -- bad timing.  These obstacles serve to show that Barney and Robin really are ready for each other, and really do care about each other.  

First, Robin starts to get serious with Kevin just as Barney and Nora are winding down.  It's all bad timing.  This is where Quinn comes in.  We know, as an audience, that Barney is going to get married at the end of the season.  We know it's not gonna be Nora.  In fact, we're all pretty sure it's gonna be Robin.  It HAS to be Robin.  So what do the writers do to make the story suspenseful?  They invent Quinn.  

Quinn is not a real character.  They throw her into the story

Sometimes it's hard to remember things that happened earlier in the season,"" is just... something else.  They really did a wonderful job expressing how these two people cared for each other.  

That's why Robin was the bride

---

**PART III: SMOKE AND MIRRORS -- QUIN AND VICTORIA**

As I mentioned

Victoria is the same way.  

Think about Ted's romantic interests.  We know that none of the ones we've met are the mother... but in each of these romantic interests

They are not.  

It's Robin.  Period.  Ted needs to get over Robin... but we know as an audience that Ted does not get over Robin until she gets married.  He gets over her because she marries his best friend and he wants them to be happy together.  That's it.  That's how he meets the mother of his future children.  

HOWEVER

Victoria, he can say ""Of course I'm over Robin... I'm dating Victoria!"" even though he knows somewhere in the back of his head that he's not over her.  

---

**PART IV: CLIMAX** 

The beauty of this show is that we know how it will end

In Season 8

Ted and Robin may or may not date.  Barney's with Quinn... maybe Robin will need to distract herself from that fact for now.  It's mostly irrelevant.  At some point, will have to come to *accept* it.  This will take time, but eventually, when they get married he will grant them his best wishes... sincerely.  

THEN

---

**PART V: TOO LONG; DIDN'T READ** 

- Barney and Robin were made for each other.  Literally.  They were written into the story with the intent that they would one day get married

- Quinn was written into the story to make you think that Barney wasn't going to marry Robin.  She is not a real character.  She is a plot device.  Stop obsessing over her.  

- Victoria's reentrance into the story makes complete sense.  Ted is not ready to get over Robin, then you check reddit, etc. Ted is going back to his browser history and looking for a good distraction.  Victoria is the only loose end.  She is the last unclicked link on Ted's proverbial front page.  After that, he knows he's gotta get down to business and ~~write this paper~~ get over this Canadian.

*The entire series is centered around the concept of Ted sitting his children down to tell them a story.*

Do you understand this concept?  8 years

Once that moment occurs, what else is on TV?"" (a la The Truman Show). I, for one, would like to have that ""oh-my-God-it's-about-to-happen"" moment last a little while longer.  Wouldn't you?

The first 8 seasons were about a story.  The last season is

Now, what makes her tick, how did she get to where she is today?  We want to know about her relationship with each of the friends, including Marvin.  

We are not going to be watching 24 half-hours of ""wedding weekend.""  We're going to be watching flashbacks, right?  Here's where that all started...""

Maybe we won't get a lot of Ted-Mother interaction, and that is really what the final season is going to be all about.

Plenty of shows end up getting cancelled.  They don't get to ""finish.""  Most end up wrapping things up within a few episodes, and we are not going to be let down.  In the future, TV shows are going to aspire to be what this was.  HIMYM will be legen--

Relax.  Stop complaining.  Because you know you're going to watch it.  

And if you definitely are not... why are you still in this reddit?

Seeing a lot of half-baked theories on this subreddit of late. Thought I'd gather a list of all the things a character must fulfil in order to even qualify at being ""The Mother""

- Attends Columbia University
- Takes Economics 305 at College (the class Ted incorrectly showed up to teach)
- Plays bass guitar
- Lives
- Ted hasn't met her as of 2012
- Ted and the Mother will meet at the wedding of Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky (S7E1)
- Ted will call her shortly after receiving her phone number (S4E21)
- Owns a yellow umbrella
- Was present at the St. Patricks Day Party of 2008 (S3E12)
- Is the first person Ted says ""I love you"" to after Robin in ""The Drunk Train/No Pressure"" (2012) (S7E17)
- Ted will first say ""I love you"" to The Mother on a failed outing to see ""The Wedding Bride III"" (S7E17)
- Her favourite flowers are lilacs (Season 6 DVD Special Feature ""What we know about your mother.)
- *May* be called Tracy/Amber (S1E9)
- Is Caucasian (S5E12)
- Has attractive ankles (S5E12)
- On their first date
- She laughs at Ted's ""shellfish"" joke (Future Ted elaborates this may be out of pity) (S5E2)
- Paints awesome pictures of robots playing sports (S5E12)
- Owns: ""Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?"" by The Unicorns. (the only other person Ted has met who has it) (S5E12)
- Is a fan of at World's End by T. Coraghessan Boyle. (She gave it to Cindy) (S5E12)
- Makes her breakfast sing show tunes; ""Your mother's rendition of 'Memory, the most hauntingly beautiful thing I have ever heard."" (I'm looking forward to seeing this.) (S5E12)
- Ted will quit smoking two weeks after meeting her (S5E11)
- Ted will be married and have a child with The Mother by April 2015. (S7E20)
- The Mother is likely a brunette (S4E5)
- She likes Pablo Neruda's poems
- Ted will meet/or talk with the Mother shortly following the Scherbatsky/Stinson wedding, confirming Future Ted's earlier statement that The Mother plays bass guitar. (S8E1)

He leaves the wedding and goes to the train station where he tells the stranger there about the events up to the wedding... and then plays out what he would like to have happened with that girl.

What plays out is this:  He meets her and she's perfect and is about to say he thinks he loves her but, he's about to do something else (I forget what it was, sadly) that he messed up in the past with another girl and instead calls Lilly and Marshal.  They remind him not to screw it up again (which he won't because he already made that mistake with a previous girl)... Finally, he's about to do one other stupid thing but gets a text from Barney reminding him not to screw it up again (which he won't because he already made that mistake with another girl)... and he says something absolutely perfect instead... and the girl totally falls head over heels for him...

But that's not what happens.  We end up back at the train station and the stranger asks him his name.  He says ""I'm Ted"".  The stranger says ""Is that the girl?""  and Ted freaks out, the stranger leads him over to the girl and says, ""Excuse me... Have you met Ted?""  And the umbrella turns finally showing the mother and they smile at each other...

""And kids... That's how I met your mother.""",self,t5_2rcqy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/1dmoty/i_had_a_dream_last_night_about_how_the_last/

1349705212.0,114yqk,There's a Good Reason Why Ted Keeps Revisiting Old Girlfriends,pipe1234,514,67,36,"Ted began the series by defining his identity through the relationships he's in. We've seen that the belongings Ted surrounds himself with are almost all things given to him by past girlfriends

This makes Ted very needy and overly willing to commit, and he basically caved on everything during their breakup fight, Stella had lots of demands to place on Ted regarding her daughter and Ted caved on those things, and he was even willing to put up with Karen for a while.


After Ted's mom gets remarried, Ted has what can only be called a complete meltdown and reacts by getting the house in the suburbs (interestingly it is completely in shambles and has to be rebuilt amost from scratch). We almost never see Ted working on it, because he does it by himself. He uses his passion of architecture to start planning the life he wants for himself through the house, and it's free from clutter left behind from past relationships, unlike his current apartment. It's a heavy metaphor, but that point is an important turning point for Ted in the series. Ted finally starts building an identity for himself separate from the family and surrogate family that he's defined himself through up until that point. 

So, he has to go back and essentially clean out the clutter from the past, check and see if it still works with who he has become. We see this with Robin and the Slutty Pumpkin. Ted has changed. He liked Victoria years ago, but he doesn't know if she fits with who he has become. He was willing to go through the self-admitted horror of a long distance relationship for her before, but he just doesn't know if she would be worth all that now that he's more mature and comfortable with who he is. This is basically the choice he has to face with all the relationships he's had so far, and though they seem resolved, I would not be surprised if Karen or even Natalie pop back one last time. 

So, able to contribute to a relationship rather than depend upon it, and meet The Mother.

When the guy holds the toast up and says, he's also talking about Marshall &amp;amp; Lily. Because remember Ted convinced Marshall to keep seing her back in college. They also cut to a shot of Marshall and Lily with the baby even before a shot of Barney and Robin. The whole group's existence is now all because of Ted. When he walks up to that window, even though he looks kind of sad, he instantly becomes the most badass member of the group. Even though he's always the butt of all their jokes, they all owe their lives and their happiness to that guy. Ted Mosby, The Ultimate Wingman.

1355489214.0,14u9cg,The Carly Theory; An Explanation [SEASON 5-8 SPOILERS],screensplitter,452,68,194,"So this is pretty much the only legitimate

*The Theory*

In S6E19, much to Barney's shock in the episode, he has started a new family after abandoning Barney as a child. This family consists of his wife, Cheryl Whittaker, his son, Jerome Jr. (""JJ"") Whittaker, and his daughter Carly Whittaker. Now, because as Jerome tells Barney

Now

- Attends Columbia University
- Takes Economics 305 at College (the class Ted incorrectly showed up to teach)

So Carly already meets the ground-level requirements for the character. Furthermore

- Lives

There's not much evidence for who could be The Mother in Cindy's apartment other than a lot of yellow objects and a glimpse of an ankle. I have heard rumours that if you watch S5E12 you can see a photo frame with ""C+C"" on it (Cindy + Carly)

This whole theory adds a nice literal twist on ""Uncle Barney"" (and as we know, who obviously have no biological connection to Ted. However, many have keyed this as a ""red herring"", in other words something that seems to be the truth deliberately made to be such, so Carter &amp; Bays can pull the carpet out from under us. **This is highly likely. I will be the first one to admit that.** However, as opposed to having a new, random character play the Mother, through his friend Barney?

It's quite clever to look at it in a very linked way;

- Over the years, sparked in truth by the death of Marshall's father, and seeing what that did to such a close friend, decides to reconcile with his Father

- He meets his Father, and Barney claims he has already met the right girl (clearly Robin). This is after Barney has split up with Robin, so clearly this is a catalyst for his feelings for her in Season 7. 

- Barney marries Robin. **He is only able to do this because he has no fears about hurting his friend Ted

*I.e. If this were the case, to his support of Barney, he becomes the person that he needs to be to set in place the destiny laid out for him.*

I made this thread due to **recent developments**

http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/12/how-i-met-your-mother-season-8-casting.html

A tweet from a reputable source has claimed that **Pretty Little Liar's Ash Benzo** is playing Barney's **????**. This is a presumption

Also, we know that The Mother; 

- Plays bass guitar
- Ted will meet/or talk with the Mother shortly following the Scherbatsky/Stinson wedding, confirming Future Ted's earlier statement that The Mother plays bass guitar.** (S8E1)
 
If Barney met his half-sister, Robin and Barney will be engaged), don't you think he'd ask his new family member out of obligation?

Now it's odd that they'd cast The Mother so soon... but keep in mind, that it would be highly amusing for the rest of the gang to meet The Mother before Ted. Barney clearly will if this is the case; and then she could run into Lily, Robin, and Marshall.
