http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/lsypb/meat_club/

About 8 months ago we posted on here looking for help. Why? We wanted to start our own meat club. I wanted to give an update if anyone was wondering what happened (pictures on imgur below):



We learned:

* pan frying
* grilling
* braising
* roasting
* stewing
* making stock
* dry aging
* marinating


Events:

* Had our own ""SausageFest"" at school and sold 60 lbs of sausage
* Took a butcher class
* Won the school cooking competition (incorporating meat into all the dishes)
* Grilled for a Jewish group and learned about Kosher Meat
* We went and learned about KBBQ + customs
* Were written about in our school newspaper and mentioned in the LA times
* Went on a group bonding retreat to Joshua Tree
* Read The Omnivore's Dilemma 

We also got some sweet tanks and made great friends.

**TL;DR: For every one person a cow feeds

0. Topic
0. Reason for topic
0. Results
0. Method: Assumptions

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Topic:**

How accurate is the Vegetarian claim that eating meat makes poor use of land in terms of the amount of food livestock provide to humans?

Cattle will be used to examine this question.

------------------------------------------------------

**Reason for topic:**

People eat meat because meat is tasty and nutritious. However, and other resources.

How accurate is this argument

--------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

For every one person that is fed on beef

This result seems reasonable: Every pound of feed eaten by a cow is used to fuel the billions of biological functions of the animal

(Edit: Read [comment about milk production] (http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/16b76u/if_a_slaughter_cow_was_never_raised_how_many_more/c7uidxm), gives a better ratio of about 1/7 for dairy cows instead of the 1/64 for slaughter cows.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Method: Assumptions

**Assumptions:**

* The sources are accurate enough to give a ballpark estimate.
* Land used to grow cattle-feed can be repurposed to grow food for humans that is of a similar caloric density.
    * In the US, rice, lentils, beans, wheat, and other staples are more calorie-dense than corn. It may be safe to assume that land yields more calories when used to grow these human staples, rather than when used to grow cattle-feed.
    * If it is true that land could yield more calories when growing human staples, so it will be ignored it for the sake of simplicity.

**Sources:**

You can see my calculations and sources in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AiHTUI0FErsndGlsSGl2MEdaU2hHQndGcC15ejhid2c&amp;output=html).

The websites where I got my sources are listed in the ""Sources"" column.

**Sources of Error:**

* My sources come from Google searches, so I feel safe in assuming the data is ""accurate enough"".
* My methods of analysis may be incorrect.
* As mentioned earlier

---------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you found this post as interesting to read as I did to research. Thank you. :)

* What are the essentials that we need to educate a group of people
* If you were to start a meat club
* Tell us anything. Any advice you can give is much appreciated.

this recipe usually lets me make about 15 lbs at a time.

The Recipe:
8 oz worcestershire sauce
8 oz Lemon juice
5 tbsp lawry's season salt
1 tbsp black pepper
2 tbsp garlic powder
1 tsp accent
1 dash of A1 (only a dash)

I let sit for 2-3 days. Grill or smoke. I use hickory chips.

Going to start trying out adding different herbs and oils

Great for making steaks or strips/jerky/bite pieces. When its hot off the grill the smoker o boy it is instant salivating for you. 

if you guys have any other ideas to try let me know. I add/change the ingredients every time i make this.

1346709750.0,zavsj,Some tips in order to make the perfect burger,Pythov,16,5,20,"1. Don't Push Down on the Meat
Consider this the cardinal rule of cooking burgers. ""It squeezes out the juices, founder and owner of the Counter burger restaurants. ""Would you rather have a juicy product that took an extra minute or a non-juicy product that came a little faster?""

2. Buy Good Meat
Weinstein likes to have his butcher custom grind his meat -- he asks for a sirloin steak or rib-eye with a meat-to-fat ratio between 75-25 and 80-20. Even if you just go to your supermarket's meat section

3. Chill the Meat First
Before you even form the patties

4. Use a Scale
Unless you want people griping about unequal treatment

5. Don't Overwork the Meat
People tend to ball up the meat as they form their patties. Don't do that; less handling is better. The more you push down and compress

6. Use Both Hands to Form the Perfect Patty
Pull the meat apart into equal pieces

7. Dimple the Patty
When beef patties cook, uneven burger. Push a little well into the center of the meat, about an inch or two around and a quarter-inch deep. The burger will be perfectly flat when they're finished cooking.

8. Back in the Fridge
After you've formed your patties

9. Use the Right Buns
Too many people put all their efforts into the meat without remembering that the bun forms more than half the burger. Try for a meat-to-bun ratio of 1:1. Buns about 4 inches to 4-1/2 inches round are generally good. You don't want a super-thick burger overhanging the buns -- but rather to get a taste of every element -- meat

10. Get the Grill Really Hot
""The hotter the better

11. Be Generous With the Salt and Pepper
Add the spices just before it goes on the grill

12. Put It on and Leave It Alone
Place the burger on the grill well-side up, you haven't let it sear long enough.""

13. Get a Nice Criss-Cross Pattern
Here's the secret to that nice pattern people love so much: After you get the first sear, cooked-side down, leave it another three to four minutes, then do another quarter turn, let it get its marking, then take it off the grill.

14. Put on the Cheese Before It Leaves the Grill
Add cheese after your last flip or turn

15. Rest the Meat
After you take it off the heat

16. Have Plenty of Toppings on Hand
Everyone's got a different idea about what tops the perfect burger. Besides the standards -- lettuce, less common options. Consider pepperoncini, jalapenos, or dried cranberries and break out of the American-cheddar-Swiss triumvirate of cheeses. Think havarti, Manchego or brie.",,False,t5_2qiya,True

I know meat in general has gone up in price across the board lately but up here tritip has gone up quite a bit more. It's about doubled in price up to around $6-6.50/lb.

My GF spent some time living in the south and according to her it's an extremely popular cut in some southern states where it fetches a higher price. She was always confused about the rock bottom price of tritip up here.

I am a fifth generation meat salesman (or will be when I graduate college next month) at a small company in Pennsylvania. We make smoked meat products like ham, and we hoped to increase it with the website. It has worked well, but there is always plenty of room to grow. This year while away at school I put up a facebook page. I thought it would be a good idea, but I have really slacked off on keeping it up. 

Here is my plan to change that: I am going to gather as many interesting facts about meat as possible and post one every day. I am going to write them in a planner so that things are planned out well in advance. I was hoping y'all could help me to get started. I am looking for interesting regional dishes or products to share, interesting anecdotes, local legends, etc. Even just telling me something you would be interested in learning about could help me to get my research started.

Here are the basics I'll be working with: NG BBQ with a rear rotisserie burner and good temp control, aiming to serve for 11:30/noon. Serving 20-25 people.

**The cut(s).**
Should I use a separate loin and belly or should I get a whole midsection and peel the skin where it overlaps? I'm getting this custom cut by my butcher so I'm pretty sure I can ask him to do whatever.

**Burners:**
Should I use the rear rotisserie burner or stick with the regular burners? Seems to me that the regular ones will give better heat coverage on the roast.

**Stuffing:**
I thought about throwing a couple of whole pork tenderloins in there in case the loin/belly alone isn't thick enough. I'll also be wrapping the loin in bacon before wrapping the belly around it. Any other stuffings I should consider (other than the seasoning)?

Is it very common for people to ask for the butchers behind the counter at a grocery store to cut a ribeye type steak? I have only asked a few times but it feels a bit awkward? Is this a normal thing to do?

The reason is I just happen to like to make a steak extra rare. Sometimes when I get the pre-packed ribeyes they have that old meat smell and taste. I'm those cases I usually throw out the meat which is a huge waste of money for me.

I love cooking meat and I usually cook at home every other day. I want to do a starters-type menu for a party and some 70 people are attending(so alot of food :) ):

My idea was to do a cold smorgasborg of meats and some complimentary sides. I know that we will be drinking some nice apple cider. I was planning on cooking the following things for the table:

1) chicken breasts - marinated in thyme, cider vingar, salt, pepper (maybe paprika?). Cooked in butter and rested, then chilled.

2) pork tender loin - basil,rosemary, garlic, small amount of olive oil. Cooked in butter and rested, then chilled.

3) beef sirloin, pepper and copious amount of butter. Cooked and rested then chilled. Thinking of medium or slightly over?

Sides would be - pickled cabbage and red onion, swedes, paprika. Some chutney which I havent decided on.
Sauces - spicy mayonnaise, pork and beef sauce.

How does the idea look so far? Any ways to make good meat into great meat would be very much appreciated :)",self,t5_2qiya,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/1da9kz/meat_recipe_request_im_cooking_starters_for_a/

It's a great price but I'm worried it will be tough. Dry aging in the fridge has worked before for me with limited effectiveness. I would like to try aging this loin in my dehydrator (in the cold garage.) 

My dehydrator is a box type with a fan in the rear. It has a temperature range of 95◦F to 155◦F and can easily fit the strip loin, bring it inside and refrigerate during the day. Alternatively I could cut the loin into steaks before doing the above process.
