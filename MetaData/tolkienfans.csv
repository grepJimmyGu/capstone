My mother and father were always meant to be together.  They sacrificed everything to be together.

They fell in love quickly and ran away to America to be together since customs wouldn't allow them to marry in India. Their love was beyond deep.  They had 3 kids (1 being me) and they were inseparable.  One day, my father has refused to get remarried, she was the love of his life.  He mourns every day and I see it in his eyes and it kills me.  When I see this scene from Twin Towers, I reverse the role sand I see my father wandering the forest alone. It kills me, but reminds me that love exists.

____

I think yours is the most commonly heard criticism of the movies (on this subreddit

&gt;and hate any and every stupid

I don't think that the trilogy, being an expert filmmaker, agreed with that assessment and included elements that aren't true to the books for that reason. Nothing ""needless,"" no Hollywood ego. I really don't think that entered into it; Peter and a few of the others (note esp. Christopher Lee and a few of the producers/script adapters) care too much for that to be the case. I wish more people understood this. It's not ""understandable hate,"" it's silly simple-mindedness.

Examples I think include Gimli's character -- large portions of The Two Towers have to be held together with merely the strength of Orlando, and some sort of relief in the form of witty lines is necessary -- Faramir, some of the more over-the-top action sequences from Legolas, etc. There are a few places that just miss the mark, like you said (Denethor was my prime focus of discontent with Return of the King), but they are few, far between, I think. The bottom line, but you can't skip it without changing the pace and order of events elsewhere. It has the additional effect of spelling out the difference between Faramir and Boromir to the non-megafan

My last point is that, which can only be a good thing. For every ten who see the movies and think of Eragon, one or two may pick up Unfinished Tales. And that's utterly worth it. I dislike Christopher Tolkien immensely for failing to understand this.

Just felt like airing my thoughts. (EDIT: and by now I've probably written 5000 words in this thread. I'm endlessly glad we're all so passionate about Lord of the Rings.)

1355157639.0,14lz5p,What would Sauron have done with Smaug and Durin's Bane?,nilhaus,97,12,59,"Imagining that somehow the events of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit played out mostly the same

First off

Sauron must have been aware of Smaug for hundreds of years, elves, and orcs were all well aware of Smaug's existence and exact location. Durin's Bane seems to be a similar story. Sauron even purposely sent orcs to inhabit the area Moria, and surely tales of the Balrog there must have reached his ears. So it seems that Sauron was aware of both entities for a long time but did nothing. Best case scenario seems to be that Sauron knew of them, but was satisfied with their position and what they were doing. I simply don't think that to be the case. Such powerful creatures shouldn't be used defensively or lazily. 

Could Sauron have controlled Smaug or Durin's Bane?

Sauron was certainly powerful as a lord and as a Maiar and influential among all races given his long record of deception and trickery. While Sauron may not have been able to bend these powerful creature to his will absolutely

A Balrog, so to what end would it resist his orders? The Balrog obviously has a desire to survive and live, as is evidence by it's hiding in Moria; yet, it makes no move to set itself up as a king among orcs or strike out beyond the gates. Compare to the Nazgul who conquered and ruled when not under the direct control of Sauron. However, when Gandalf is in his presence it relishes in the opportunity to kill him, even at the very real risk of dying himself. Durin's Bane seems ripe for directing in battle if pushed by a more powerful creature like Sauron. I'd say yes, Sauron could have controlled the Balrog in that it would willingly participate in the destruction of elves, and men; as it had ages ago. 

What of Smaug?

Dragons are notoriously independent creatures. Even the mighty Melkor, Sauron is cunning and would likely know this, and also know how to influence Smaug to his own wishes. Smaug would be easily provoked into revenge and by greed. Sauron could offer any number of cities for plundering and at the most extreme even one of the lesser rings of power. We know he had many of them in his possession, somewhere around twelve if I remember correctly. Again, the answer seems to be yes. Sauron could bend Smaug to his will in one way or another, though not as absolutely or willingly as the Balrog. 

How are these two creatures best used?

It is hard to place any absolute strength on creatures in Tolkien's writings, or dwarf, barring special circumstances. 

A flying, immune to arrows (mostly...) and likely able to dispatch eagles without much trouble. What better use than the destruction of Lothlorien? We know it was under a attack during the final battle, and the presence of Smaug could have tipped the balance in Sauron's favor. Smaug ~~was already in the area anyway and~~ clearly liked burning down trees as evidence by the desolation of Smaug. Galadriel or Celeborn may have been able to drive him off or even kill Smaug, but the destruction he would have brought could destroy their city and force them to flee. Just as good. 

What of Durin's Bane? Well, imagine the Balrog striding (not flying) through to duel with Gandalf. Given their relative parity he may succeed this time, and at a minimum he is keeping Gandalf from rallying troops and saving the city. Again, just as good. The Balrog might have followed them there anyway, not requiring much direction.

I feel like I should have a conclusion, I imagine Sauron would have preferred to set up one of his Nazgul as king there.

We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance.  The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth.
 
So, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Wingnut Films, and the entire cast and crew of “The Hobbit” films, I’d like to announce that two films will become three.  
 
It has been an unexpected journey indeed

So, I think a lot of fans can agree that when it comes to the actual canonical text of the Rings saga, Gollum is far and away the most deep and complex character we get. Not just because of his motivations and personality in the book but because of the implications in regards to Tolkien's otherwise strictly ordered sense of morality. What follows is a set of discussion questions I would really like to see Tolkien fans discuss, and which I have some opinions on myself:

First of all, the Hobbits seem to be extremely good at resisting the temptation of the power of the ring. Of course, Smeagol was something like a hobbit, and was also the primary Ringbearer outside of Sauron. This question gets into some of my later questions, but surely Gollum had the least potential for evil within him of all the Ringbearers? Of the hobbits we see that Frodo eventually imagines himself the ruler of the world and that Sam sees himself as a mighty warrior, but Gollum had the ring for centuries and his greatest ambition seemed to be to merely possess the ring and sustain himself. He did horrible things to obtain and attempt to take back the ring, but what of Gollum's POTENTIAL for evil actions?

Secondly, but throughout the text it is suggested that Gollum is interested in redemption. It just so happens that his redemption (or chance at redemption) is facilitated by a supportive peer: Frodo (and hampered by a disapproving peer: Sam). Of course, Gollum and Frodo ultimately fail in their struggle with their addiction (keep Tolkien off the AA reading list, please) but why? In my estimation of things: Frodo is in the heart of evil at that point the book, and Gollum has only had one individual care for him in centuries. Gollum was so reviled for his personal weakness and his addiction that his entire identity became it. He was named Gollum not really by himself or by the power of the ring but by his community who hated him. Might there be an interpretation in Tolkien that evil is not really absolute? That support from those who understand you and believe you can do better can make you better? Could this have been true for Sauron? Or Melkor/Morgoth?

Lastly, is there anyone who is actually disappointed with the portrayal of Gollum by Serkis in the films? In my estimation, there is too much of a divide between a clearly ""evil"" side (Gollum) and a clearly ""good"" side (Smeagol) which I feel like was never intended. As a matter of fact, given my history with the actual books, it has always been the only thing I really took offense to in the films. In my mind, Gollum in the books was always Gollum, he never had multiple personalities, the movie portrays it in such a way that it makes it look the ring turns you into some sort of schizophrenic. Am I remembering things wrong or is that not at all supported by the text?",t5_2r6jm,True

1328451112.0,pbts8,Gandalf and his role. Thought it be fun to get a discussion going.,,72,8,45,"Maybe it's just me but I've noticed some discussions going on about Gandalf and his role in the books. So I though it'd be fun to put it into one post where we can chat about it. 

So in the spirit of starting the discussion: 

The Unfinished Tales tells us that Gandalf was sent to Middle-Earth, or to seek to dominate Elves or men by force or fear.” (The Unfinished Tales 506) 

Gandalf shows this behavior several times during the course of the books. He never displays his power unless there is great need for it

Then there is also the subject of his role as a messenger. Tolkien mentions in his letters that: “His [Gandalf’s] function as a ‘wizard’ is an angelos or messenger from the Valar or Rulers.” (Letters 237) Note Tolkien's use of the word ""angelos""
However Tom Shippey points out that Gandalf certainly didn't appear as the iconographic kind of angel. He was too short tempered, doubt and hunger. That to provide Gandalf with anything other than a human form and emotions “would instantly diminish the stature of their characters, devalue their decisions and their courage.” (The Road to Middle-Earth 171) That is to say Tolkien deliberately made him relatable.

Shippey’s point is interesting because if Tolkien had made Gandalf and the Istari glorious compared to the Valar, or driven by divine inspiration, as opposed to a spark of courage or imagination driven by human inspiration, separate from the divine.   

So with all this in mind what is your take on Gandalf? Do you agree with me or not

I'm looking forward to your thoughts!

Second prize: A set of the original Ballantine paperback edition of *The Lord of the Rings* with the Barbara Remington covers. In decent but not collectible condition

Rules: Send me (/u/ebneter) a PM with your answers, including the Internet and books.*

1. Tolkien once commented that all the lore mentioned in *The Lord of the Rings* pre-existed in his mythology

2. Gandalf recites a rhyme to himself while riding Shadowfax to Gondor, the seven stones, and the white tree. What was the history of the white tree?

3. What is the earliest mention of the herb *athelas* in *The Lord of the Rings*? Discuss the significance of its appearance at this point in the story.

4. Who are the dead in the Dead Marshes? What occurred there?

5. What are all of Gandalf's names in Middle-earth? What name was he known by in Valinor? What Vala did he serve there?

Tie-breaker: Sam recites his poem about a troll when the hobbits and Strider encounter the stone trolls from Bilbo's adventure. Like several other poems associated with *The Lord of the Rings*

Scoring will be like the previous contest

EDIT @3:00PM PDT: Only four entries so far? Wow. I thought this one was pretty easy

EDIT @5:15PM PDT: Still only five entries. I am going to extend this 24 hours and cross-post to /r/lotr.

EDIT: Time's up! I will grade and post the winners tomorrow.

And we have a winner! Two winners, since there are two prizes. First place goes to /u/Cheimon, and second goes to /u/ladyofgaladhris. There was a tie for third between /u/uncornrage and /u/lomethoron.

Some interesting things: Only a couple of people got (1) correct; the answer is the cats of Queen Beruthiel. Tolkien later came up with a story linking her to one of the Kings of Gondor, originally titled ""Pēro and Pōdex"" and then ""The Root of the Boot,"" was first published in the extremely rare pamphlet called *Songs for the Philologists*, edited by Tolkien's friend and collaborator E.V. Gordon. Question (2) was mostly answered correctly, although the common answer that the seven stars are the Valacirca is actually not supported by Tolkien anywhere that I am aware of, despite it seeming incredibly obvious. (If someone can find a reference for Tolkien stating the connection, I would be grateful.) I gave full credit for both the Valacirca or the alternative

1369718489.0,1f6mck,Lore Contest II: Answers,ebneter,58,8,13,"Several people have requested the answers to the questions

&gt; 1. Tolkien once commented that all the lore mentioned in *The Lord of the Rings* pre-existed in his mythology

Tolkien wrote, or at least belonging to an earlier period — except on the 'cats of Queen Berúthiel.'"" (*Letters*, p. 228) In *Unfinished Tales*, however, we find, in a note to the essay ""The Istari"", that Berúthiel was later explained to be the wife of Tarannon, who lived in Osgiliath and hated ""the sounds and the smells of the sea... She had nine black cats and one white, setting them to discover all the dark secrets of Gondor..."" (*Unfinished Tales*

&gt; 2. Gandalf recites a rhyme to himself while riding Shadowfax to Gondor, the seven stones, and the white tree. What was the history of the white tree?

The seven stones, but the seven stars are surprisingly more difficult to explain. Tolkien's explanation, at least in the Index of the Second Edition, is that the seven stars ""originally represented the single stars on the banners of each of seven ships (of 9) that bore a *palantír*."" Tolkien himself seems to have missed the obvious connection to the Valacirca, the Sickle of the Valar, placed in the northern sky as a warning to Melkor before the awakening of the Elves.  (I gave credit for both answers; although the second isn't supported by the text, Tolkien's actual explanation has a rather strained quality to it.)

The White Tree, and planted in Minas Ithil. Nimloth was a seedling of Celeborn, a seedling of Galathilion, the White Tree of the Eldar, made by Yavanna as a model of Telperion (or maybe a seedling of Telperion — both tales are extant). Nimloth was given to Elros by the Eldar of Tol Eressëa, and eventually burned on an altar by Sauron during the reign of A-Pharazôn. The original White Tree of Gondor was destroyed when Sauron captured Minas Ithil in the Second Age, but Isildur took a seedling from this tree and planted it in the Citadel of Minas Anor (later, Minas Tirith) after the overthrow of Sauron. That tree died during the Great Plague in TA 1636

&gt; 3. What is the earliest mention of the herb *athelas* in *The Lord of the Rings*? Discuss the significance of its appearance at this point in the story.

*Athelas* is first mentioned in the chapter ""Flight to the Ford, when Aragorn uses it to heal Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, and his identity as the King is revealed — ""'The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.'"" It is the second hint (after Bilbo's poem in Gandalf's letter) — although one will not know this on first reading — that Strider is much more than he seems.

&gt; 4. Who are the dead in the Dead Marshes? What occurred there?

The dead are the Men and Elves killed in the Battle of Dagorlad

&gt; 5. What are all of Gandalf's names in Middle-earth? What name was he known by in Valinor? What Vala did he serve there?

""*Mithrandir among the Elves, some less than polite, but those are his names. *Olórin*, of course, was his name in Valinor. There he was associated with Lórien/Irmo and Manwë, and learned mercy and pity from Nienna. As is usual with Tolkien, however

&gt; Tie-breaker: Sam recites his poem about a troll when the hobbits and Strider encounter the stone trolls from Bilbo's adventure. Like several other poems associated with *The Lord of the Rings*

The poem, edited by Tolkien's friend and collaborator E.V. Gordon and printed at Oxford. (It is believed that only 14 copies survive.) It was meant to be sung to the tune of the traditional song ""The Fox Went Out,"" and there is a recording of Tolkien singing it available. It was reprinted in *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* after its appearance in *The Lord of the Rings.* The main changes between the original version and the later version involve removing references to Christian beliefs like the fate of the soul and changing ""churchyard"" to ""graveyard."" The original version was reprinted in *The Annotated Hobbit* and a slightly different version in *The Return of the Shadow.*

As for me I proposed to my girlfriend of 3 years in a forest overlooking a natural whirlpool and reciting a passage from 'The Silmarillion'.

'He forgot then utterly all his folk and all the purposes of his mind, and the light of Aman was in her face.
No word she spoke but being filled with love Elwe came to her and took her hand; and straightaway a spell was laid on him, while long years were measured by the wheeling stars above them; and the trees of Nan Elmoth grew tall and dark ere they spoke any word to one another.'

She looked surprised

And I'm sure he alludes to the fact that Orcs and Humans sometimes interbreed... the 'squint-eyed Southerner' in Bree is described as being human

I guess what I'm asking is whether Tolkein really intended his Orcs to be as bestial as they've come to be portrayed in later years. Is there any chance he intended them to be something akin to a very violent/backward/dirty species of human?

1375035182.0,1j85cz,Tolkien's lesser known books: Sir Orfeo,el_micha,51,9,22,"Dear fellow Tolkien-fans!

The top posts in this subreddit all concern Tolkien's more popular works: The Hobbit, which are *not* set in Middle-Earth. 

Recently, people mention The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún, or Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, or older texts about Tom Bombadil. But the talk about these (and similar) books is surprisingly sparse. Since this is /r/tolkienfans and not ""just"" /r/lotr, I hope and think we have the potential to not exclusively deal with Tolkien's most popular literature, but also discuss some of his lesser known works. This is not meant as a critique, but as a suggestion.

I will start by introducing **Sir Orfeo**

*Sir Orfeo* is Professor Tolkien's translation of a short Middle English [narrative poem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Orfeo) from an anonymous author who lived around the early 14th century. As is typical for Tolkien

The story is about Sir Orfeo, who is being kidnapped by a Fairy King. Orfeo, a terrific harper, sets out to find his lost queen and win her back with his lovely music.    
Sounds familiar? Well, this tale from [Ovid's Metamorphoses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus#Death_of_Eurydice) has found it's way to medieval England, where it was written down and at last made available for all of us to read by Professor Tolkien. 

*Sir Orfeo* is not only very beautiful to read and interesting because of it's age and long tradition
When the Dwarves and Bilbo travel through Mirkwood

*There often by him would he see
*when noon was hot on leaf and tree
*the king of Faërie with his rout*    
*came hunting in the woods about*    
*with blowing far and crying dim
*and barking hounds that were with him;*    
*yet never a beast they took nor slew
*and where they went he never knew.*     
*At other times he would descry*     
*a mighty host,*     
*ten hundred knights all fair arrayed*     
*with many a banner proud displayed...*    

While the chapter *Flies and Spiders* in the Hobbit is not quite so explicit about the Fairy King

For comparison

*He might se him bisides
*Oft in hot undertides
*The king o fairy with his rout*    
*Com to hunt him al about*    
*With dim cri and bloweing
*And houndes also with him berking;*    
*Ac no best thai no nome
*No never he nist whider they bicome*    
*And other while he might him se*    
*As a gret ost bi him te
*Wele atourned
*Ich y-armed to his rightes
*Of cuntenaunce stout and fers
*With mani desplaid baners...*    

Isn't this amazing? How well Tolkien preserved the tone, even the vocabulary is astoundingly similar! And once you have read the translation, the original is not even too hard to understand. 

So

I should probably have stated what is considered 'canon' for these purposes: Any writing about Middle-earth *published during J.R.R. Tolkien's lifetime*. That is:  *The Hobbit*, and *The Road Goes Ever On*. In other words, *The Silmarillion* is *not* canonical, as we don't know that JRRT would have approved every jot and tittle. Material from JRRT's *Letters*, if stated definitively enough, may also be considered canonical, especially if strongly supported by other canonical material.

Also in Lothlorien none of the fellowship could figure out how much time had passed when they were in Calas Galadhon.


A quote from Elrond: ""But maybe when the One has gone


Both realms, The One, was forged by Sauron alone. He's not an elf, certainly not of the Noldor so his Ring wouldn't fall under the Doom right? WRONG.


Under Celebrimbor's rule (after Galadriel and Celeborn left for Lothlorien) a certain ""Lord of Gifts"", they made Eregion a beautiful city and without Annatar the Noldor could never have reached the peak of their Ring-craft and the Apex of the Three Elven Rings (which I believe as stated earlier could some how hold off the doom of mandos) but here's the catch. Annatar was Sauron in disguise and he crafted the One so it would be the master of all the lesser rings. But here is something you might not know, the noldor taught Sauron as much as he taught them. His Ring was forged through noldor lore and could have only been wrought with the knowledge that they provided. Otherwise what had been the point of Annatar befriending the noldor in the first place? So I maintain that the One was in fact a work of the Noldor and would have fallen under the doom of Mandos

First I would like to thank you for the amazing response to my TEDxTalk the other day.

LotrProject is a website I started in January 2012 with the purpose of visualizing the vast world of Middle-Earth with creative web projects. It currently features a gigantic family tree with 923 characters

With the increasing popularity of the site the bandwidth usage has gone up a lot and I will soon need to upgrade to a more expensive hosting solution. I am a full time engineering student and I can not afford that on my own.

So

I'm not sure if many of you have played **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** before

My idea was to put on some headphones and use Skyrim's music as a soundtrack to my reading experience. I couldn't possibly have imagined at this point the sheer beauty and wonder that this music would add to the book. I'll give you a few examples that blew me away.

When Morgoth sent out his armies to destroy the goodly Elves in the chapter ""Of the Ruin of Beleriand""

It was so incredibly saddening that I was literally almost moved to tears.

This track played at the first meeting of Beren and Lúthien: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo3VAltxlr8&amp;feature=relmfu

Again

This is where it gets eerie. When Beren cuts the Silmaril from Morgoth's crown

Simply terrifying. But it gets better. When the great wolf Carcharoth bites off Beren's hand and swallows the Silmaril

I was very freaked out at this point

It's almost post-apocalyptic. In a way. Like.. The Middle-Earth we see from the Second Age onward is like the remnants of the apocalyptic world-changing events that ended the First Age. And it just seems like Sauron is trying to take over this broken world.

* Sean Astin used to go to the farm every year for Christmas with the landowners

* The flora on site had to be specially imported from England (obviously to properly represent the Shire): there 
were strict rules set in place by the New Zealand government to stop any unwanted ""side effects"" taking place

* All the fruit trees on the farm were figs - the figs were digitally altered in post-processing to resemble pears!

* The old tree above Bag End was actually dead wood constructed offsite and pinned together when it reached the film set

* the grove of trees you first meet Frodo in (reading a book in FotR) is actually about 10 miles away from the rest of Hobbiton

* a party of people all dressed up as Arwen once descended on the guides and demanded to be allowed to dance around the Party Tree

* Much like the pear/fig trees - the Party Tree is a New Zealand native

* They once had a 7ft man dressed up as Bilbo go around the set

* I spotted (upon a new part of Hobbiton made especially for ""The Hobbit"") a Hobbit hole with what looked like boat oars sitting outside - the guide admitted not knowing why a Hobbit hole in Hobbiton would have these but also let slip that other parts of the Shire would be filmed using these Hobbit holes.

As another thread said

Also, are necessary as devices for film storytelling. However, I don't understand why Jackson insists on distorting small parts of the history of Middle-Earth to include those devices. Why is Azog still alive? He perfectly could've used a big orc that wasn't supossed to be dead for a century. I imagine Thorin or Dain will kill him in the Battle of the Five Armies. 

Also

The sequence about Erebor is simply fantastic, specially with Azog holding Thror's head.

I think the movie really captures the spirit of the book, but not disrupting anything, like Thranduil riding a fucking Megaloceros.

Only one doubt remains: the orc tongue that's spoken on the film

However I'm really happy

after talking to other tolkienfans

mostly

gandalf's main worry is that sauron is already powerful enough to launch an attack on rivendell and lorien; a war which he believes sauron would win. gandalf sees himself as the one who has to make the attack on dol guldur happen. he believes that saruman isn't interested and is actually focused on finding the ring (which some people - sauron and saruman - suspect may have been found). 

that's probably where galadrial comes in - because of her concerns/fears that lorien will be attacked. as a result, and force sauron to flee to mordor - resulting in sauron focusing his attack on gondor instead. 

back to thorin, the quest would fail. thorin eventually relented and everything worked out.

so

This passage made me just stop and put down the book for a minute. It isn't much without context, we do not yet see it as a major competitor with his steely resolve.

At this stage in the book, he just slumps down and stops speaking. A darkness climbs over him, and he does not cry, and does not mourn, but remains completely still and silent.

And then, where endless laughter is said to run. Turin's companion bids him to drink from it and be healed, and then the passage comes in. 

To me, one of the best pieces of writing in the entire book. Not even the death of Beleg hurt me as much as Turin's tears. The closest parallel I can think of is this one from the TV show LOST (SPOILERS UP AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU INTEND TO WATCH LOST/HAVE NOT FINISHED LOST)

1375940368.0,1jxtgc,Lore Contest III: Question 3,ebneter,27,2,20,"Was Galadriel still under exile during the Third Age?

Was Galadriel *ever* under exile? Galadriel, she did not, in fact, exist in Tolkien's pre-*Lord of the Rings* mythology. At some point during the writing, however, he decided that she was a Noldorin Elf, a decision that created some complications: Why was one of the High Noldor still in Middle-earth?

This is another question that many think has a canonical answer, Galadriel says, ""I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel,"" implying that there is no ban on her return. Yet later, when bidding Frodo and the Company farewell, ""But if of ships I now should sing

If Galadriel was uncertain, Gilthoniel!"", he writes:

&gt; The question *Sí man i yulma nin enquantuva?* and the question at the end of her song (Vol. I, refer to the special position of Galadriel. She was the last survivor of the princes and queens who had led the revolting *Noldor* to exile in Middle-earth. After the overthrow of *Morgoth* at the end of the First Age a ban was set upon her return, and she had replied proudly that she had no wish to do so.

Yet, and in other writings he speculated that while Galadriel had been a willing participant in the departure from Valinor, she had not participated in the events that would have led to such a perpetual ban, notably the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and so she was in Middle-earth of her own free will. But that, of course, would have contradicted published work stating the contrary. In his last writings, suggesting that she (and possibly Celeborn) had come to Middle-earth separately from Fëanor's group!

The question is thus completely unresolved

Take this with a grain of salt. I am fully aware of who and what Melkor is and what horrible acts he has committed. I am not saying he is not worthy of his title

Is Melkor really the bad guy here? I mean we all know where he ends up, who was the bravest being thus far ever created because he alone conceived and acted upon the concept of challenging that which he was presented with. He questioned the space around him, he did not accept the picture painted for him by Eru. Too eager to learn the true nature of existence and not willing to accept the one and only way painted by this higher power even though unlike most Melkor knew the divine to be real and had looked upon him and knew full well his power and majesty without question but he still chose to close his eyes to Eru. He challenged God's plan not necessarily to harm or cause grief at first but simply to try his hand, to explore his capabilities, to push himself to unforeseen heights, to question. And this I really feel for because it's very similar to my fall out with religion as a child etc. This is where i started to see kinship in Melkor, a kind of understanding of where he was coming from. He did not see why he could not rise to equal or higher standing than Eru himself and is that not similar to our actions as a species, straining to climb higher, cast out. He was pushed to the darkness

*EDIT: Awesome comments!! Very impressed and humbled by some of your Tolkien knowledge!! Love all the fantastic information on Melkor that exploded forth. Hes such an interesting villain. Keep it up! Cheers!

I would love to know more about Eru's feelings on Melkor and the path he chose to take as Melkor was after all Eru's creation.

1375937203.0,1jxqaj,Lore Contest III: Question 1,ebneter,22,0,18,"Who was Tom Bombadil?

In the Primary World, in typical fashion, turned him into a poem, originally published in the *Oxford Magazine* on 13 February 1934. When he began writing the sequel to *The Hobbit*, he put Bombadil in as part of the traveling hobbits' first great adventure in the Old Forest, believing, as he did at the time, of course

But Tolkien did not remove him, at least — that Tolkien felt was important. In Letter 154, Tolkien wrote,

&gt; In historical fact I put him in because I had already 'invented' him independently (he first appeared in the Oxford Magazine) and wanted an 'adventure' along the way. But I kept him in, individual, ridiculous a name — but 'allegory' is the only mode of exhibiting certain functions: he is then an 'allegory', or an exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science: the spirit that desires knowledge of other things, their history and nature, *because they are 'other'* and wholly independent of the enquiring mind, and entirely unconcerned with 'doing' anything with the knowledge: Zoology and Botany not Cattle-breeding or Agriculture. ... Also T.B. exhibits another point in his attitude to the Ring, whether to tell a tale, is not a delusion — but it is not the whole picture

But *what*, in Letter 144, he wrote, 

&gt; ...even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas

In case you were wondering

But what might he have been? Tolkien was also very explicit that there was no incarnation of Eru Ilúvatar in Middle-earth, although there are certain contradictions with this notion); he is [the Witch-king of Angmar](http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/theories/bombadil.htm); he's [an evil being older than Morgoth](http://km-515.livejournal.com/1042.html); he's some other sort of spirit. Any of these could be true, but the evidence isn't very good for any of them.

1375938049.0,1jxr5j,Lore Contest III: Question 2,ebneter,22,2,18,"Where did Orcs come from?

That's a really good question. A lot of people think this has a canonical answer, and taken up by Peter Jackson in his films, is that Morgoth bred Orcs from captured Elves back in the First Age. This isn't canonical, however, because in assembling the published *Silmarillion*, Christopher Tolkien had to edit together writings from many different times and different conceptions his father had of his world. In particular, he felt obliged to include ""a"" single origin for Orcs rather than deal with the difficulties of his father's thought on the subject.

And difficult it was. In the very earliest tales of Middle-earth (specifically, and that, indeed, only Ilúvatar could create sentient creatures — Aule's Dwarves were not sentient until Eru made them so. And whatever else they were, Orcs were clearly sentient. Moreover, when he put goblins into *The Hobbit*, he established that they could *breed* — Bolg was the son of Azog. And since the only sentient creatures about in the First Age early enough to make Orcs out of were Elves

But he realized fairly quickly that this idea was problematical, though, that Orcs — some of them, at least — lived long lives; Bolg was alive some 140 years after the death of his father Azog; and various things in both *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* suggest that they might live even longer.) Tolkien dabbled with other ideas, including that Orcs were merely ""dumb"" beasts animated by the will of Morgoth or Sauron (contradicted by their apparent autonomy in the absence and even presence of either of those beings, not to mention Saruman's Orcs); that they were corrupted Men, although that fell afoul of the timeline of the First Age; that they were fallen Maiar, who then bred physically like Melian; or ... but he never decided.

So I read the Silmarillion a long time ago, and how tragic and sad it is. When I realize just how far the Numenoreans fell given where their ancestors came from, it leaves a sort of empty feeling in you, and pity for fictional characters, which isn't something I would normally feel.

The themes that run through the book- Man's fear of death and discontent with good- are powerful to say the least. After the Silmarillion and reading about all the shit the Edain went through because of Morgoth and Sauron, and shunning the war-mongering and desire for dominance over others that defined the Dark Powers:

&gt; For the Dúnedain became mighty in crafts
have surpassed the evil kings of Middle-earth in the making of war and the forging of weapons; but 
they were become men of peace

Then later in the story

&gt;And they sailed now with power and armoury to Middle-earth, but as fierce men of war. And they hunted the men of 
Middle-earth and took their goods and enslaved them
a tale of dread.

Major difference, wandering the seas looking for memories of things that used to be:

&gt; For the Dúnedain held that even mortal Men
those of their bodies' life; and they longed ever to escape from the shadows of their exile and to see 
in some fashion the light that dies not; for the sorrow of the thought of death had pursued them over the deeps of the sea. Thus it was that great mariners among them would still search the empty seas, and found them like to the old 
lands

So I'm just rambling now. But the I thought the story was beautiful, or think differently? Also, I've been wondering about how real the fear of death and the discontent of people in times of good really is. But it's hard to make comparisons to Tolkiens works since they take place over long periods of time.

- What is the most recent copyright date on the copyright page? 
- What printing number?* 
- What is the price on the inside of the jacket? 
- What color are the hardcover boards? 
- Did you buy the book new? if yes

If you have pictures that would be great! 

* If it says something like 60 59 58 57 56 55 then it is the 55th printing for example. This would be on the copyright page.
