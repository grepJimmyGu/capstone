1366969819.0,1d58mj,[Modpost] Reasoning for CONTROVERSIAL/NSFW tags,Quickswitch79,67,11,23,"Hi everyone

I'd just like a quick update as to why you may see some flags with the CONTROVERSIAL/NSFW tag.

We all share a common interest in flags. Whether that be specifically in the design, or flags to do with fascism etc and they haven't been removed. 

It's not that we're looking to garner support for these people or advocating what happened in the past

Myself and my fellow mods will sometimes step in and tag a submission as CONTROVERSIAL. This is *purely* as a safety step for those at work.

Whilst we know what's going on as we're into flags, could end up in said person being given a written warning or even fired.

Those who have set up their accounts to not display NSFW will be protected from this
