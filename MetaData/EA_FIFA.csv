1349846711.0,118lpa,The sum of all FIFA,Boomslang00,154,14,22,"Im playing ultimate team.15 points in the bank and have 1 game until the season is over. In Division II, and Hart in goal. The entire team is rare players, multiple multiple corners for both of us the whole game

I take my first touch in slow motion and my heart stops beating. I'm just playing FIFA, as an old man dies just down the hall, a plane in Germany is delayed for take off, the pilot must use the restroom, a small boy in Mexico City falls asleep watching Finding Nemo with spanish subtitles, some man somewhere is waking up to what will be his best day ever just as his counter part gets home from what was surely his absolute worst. Time reboots and begins again. The shot hits the post as a bong shatters into 100 pieces due to a clumsy hand off somewhere in Houston. The rebound lands right before Jose Antonio Reyes (81 LW Sevilla), a quick left - right - SHOOT!!!....and the ball goes into the back of the net, carrying microbial life, just achieved world peace. A tear rolls down the cheek of God and disappears inside a super massive black hole. And me? I am victorious...victorious at last.

Then the internet disconnects...all gone.

As many of you know

At the time

When we pulled the trigger on it, it's clear to me that the grand experiment was a successful one, despite any of the problems it caused. 

I'm not going to lie -- /r/EA_FIFA is the best FIFA community on reddit and that's YOUR fault. Even if you point out some of the things that I've done to assist you

That's why I'm going to to follow your lead on this next proposal. 

As you've probably noticed, I really appreciated your loyalty. A lot of nice things were said about me and what we've created here and believe me, I took note of all that was said.

So...

*Those* conversations led to /u/criminolelawyer (the top moderator of /r/FIFA) approaching me to seriously consider what we could do about ending this rift. Him and I weren't able to solve this thing a year ago

But now he's the top moderator and we've been collaborating on the best case scenario for our subreddits

What we've come to agree on is that we should simply follow what's been said. If /r/EA_FIFA is the better community and /r/FIFA is the better name

*Our CSS Style and Sidebar Content becomes theirs...*

*Our Flair and FUT Filter becomes theirs...*

*Our Moderator becomes theirs...*

The basic proposal is, /u/criminolelawyer would stay on and lead a lot of the community aspects of the sub. That's where his strengths lie, and I think having a healthy community that isn't so spread out will allow for us to do a lot more in organizing events and contests that end up making the subreddit more than just our Rage Against The Sweat. 

Most of the recent polling data is consistent with this being the best idea for both communities

So

I can also answer any questions you have regarding this idea. It's still just a proposal

Skill moves were changed but I didn't really work out how

Also there was something about if you are holding sprint before your player has the ball he will take a long touch and place the ball ahead of him or something.

Over all I can say the game felt sluggish compared to fifa 13 the passing and defending was pretty fluid but sprinting with the ball will get some time to get used to.

* When you are one on one with your opponent's goalkeeper, but I will still use as little power as possible.

* When your opponent is one on one with your goalkeeper, tricking your opponent into trying a chip shot or shooting too early. Like I mentioned earlier, scoring when the keeper is on his line is super easy. This has saved my ass so many times. 

* Often

* Get used to having player switching on air balls only Auto is crappy. It may seem hard

* Keep your defenders back and try to tackle the opponent with your midfielders. Using your midfielders to tackle means that your defenders stay in position and through balls are less effective. If you come rushing out with a CB

* Dont sprint all the time. Rarely should you sprint in your own half or in the middle of the pitch. Only sprint when there are no defenders in front of you. You are really easy to tackle while sprinting

* Skill moves are very effective when used correctly. The step-over is very effective and all players can do it. The roulette is a great 3* skill move. The Ronaldo chop

* In any formation without a CDM, Luiz Gustavo, Xabi Alonso, Tiote and Fellaini.

* Don't go diving in with tackles. I usually jockey to tackle

* When in doubt

* Don't be afraid to pass back to your goalkeeper when under pressure. On the ground though

* One that I would add is to be sure to use L2 when receiving passes under defensive pressure. Trapping the ball lets you change direction quickly and if they are charging at you you can often get past defenders and get scoring opportunities in this way. (Tip from /u/pjc101)

* One tip that always helps me is to call a second defender while manually switching to another defender to intercept the pass. The opponent will be pressured by the second defender and be forced to pass and it really helps a lot. Also when attacking

* In Ultimate Team individual chemistry is more important than Overall chemistry. Temporarily remove your manager

* Morale is almost as important as chemistry and has a major influence on how well your team plays. Whenever I build a new team I always apply a squad morale card. They only cost around 500 coins.

* Set custom tactics. I have 4, One for when I am winning (More possession in attacking build up, looser defense), and one for the pacy counter attack teams (Deeeeep defense, Counter attacking with long balls and quick build up). Tip by /u/ThaMastaBlasta

* Play defence with a midfielder

* One thing that helps me out when I'm playing well is low powered through passes (pretty much just tap the button) when in tight spaces in your opponents third
Also

* The double tap shot all the way for me. Sneaks under keepers dives so often and goes in with little power. Tip by /u/plewes37

* When playing against good defensive players/World Class or Legendary CPU, trust me, is very easy to defend for an experienced player.
Keep possession, then try the other flank or go for a slow build-up through the middle. Use as much of the field as you can. It doesn't matter what team you're using or who you're playing, as long as you do these things gaps will eventually open. Tip by /u/ASS_IN_MY_PISS 

* If you want to actually score when someone brings their keeper out, but trust me, finesse it around the keeper if you have your LM/RM/CAM/ST through in the 1on1 situation. Tip by /u/henkizh

* Practice switching the play. Sometimes when play is focused on one side of the field for a while and you're running out of space

* Look for passing triangles. It's the simplest piece of advice but it's something that a lot of people neglect. Tip by /u/Yaki304

* Here's one tip I think will help everyone. Keep your eye on the field for passes when the opponent is backing off a bit, then go back and look for passing lanes.
Also, even a switch from the left side of the field to the middle of the field can chance. If you have the ball with your wingers, don't just either sprint down the wing or cut in. Use them as attacking mids sometimes, bring them central from deep in the midfield and let the CAMs take their position to bring a different look to the defenders. Tip by /u/bemerktaufdeutsch

* When taking a header from a cross/corner, so really, as quickly as possible. Also make sure to hold L2/LT and jockey for position before jumping, and just press shoot right as you'd want the player to jump. Tip by /u/Rauxbaught

* EA is cheap and doesn't include an instruction booklet with controls. Find it here: http://www.ea.com/soccer/manuals/fifa13
Don't underestimate the usefulness of figuring out all of the default controls. Tip by /u/tron-

* Hitting a trailer with a bouncing cross (triple tap square) when you are running out of space from the outside has scored me tons and tons of goals in both online and offline play.
Try to play one step ahead of your opponent on offense if you like to pass the ball around. As soon as you decide on a pass and hit the button
An add on to the last one: The game almost never allows you to play two through balls in a row if you are trying to pass your way up the field. Ground pass until you see a low-risk through ball
One final tip: Use the radar! It's crazy to me how many of my friends that I play with never even notice it's there. Incredibly important for trying to play long through balls, etc. Tip by /u/djp4516

* My tip would be don't be afraid to stop. Completely stopping, and makes getting past defenders super easy. Tip by /u/potpan0

* A simple ball roll at the right time when the keeper is rushing out to grab the ball from your feet will put you past him 99% of the time. Tip by /u/thedouglerr

1. On goal kicks try to kick it to your LB/RB by using about two bars of power. It is a safer place to kick the goal kick so it doesn't come right back at you!
2. Double tap shoot when a goalie is rushing your player in a 1 on 1. Most of the time it will roll right by the GK!
3. On corners aim as far toward the goal as you can
4. Bring the extra player over on a corner and pass to them
5. Look for players that are almost behind the defense on free kicks in your own half. Hold up while you use 4-4.5 bars and start running toward the ball as soon as you kick it. With fast players you can get a 1 on 1 from this situation. 
6. When your opponent has a 1 on 1 pull your keeper out a couple of steps to spook the other player then tap triangle again to send him back.  With finesse shots so much weaker this year you don't have to worry as much about the player curling it around your keeper and you will save more shots or make them pass/shoot early.

**Before you trade:** Before you trade, you won't be frustrated when you're sitting down for X hours, with no real goal. Secondly, have a technique in mind that you hope to use. Don't go in just hoping you stumble upon a good deal. Know what technique you are using, and base what technique you use around profit intended, time and coins on hand. Now to the first technique.

**The lazy mans trade:** When first learning to trade, bid on any rare player above 60 pace. Then, once all the players you have bid on ends, and you have say 5 players either search them on the market and find the cheapest BIN in that formation and undercut it, or make an educated guess. In one session, this technique can return 2-4k on average, requires only about 8k to use and is very simple. This is useful for a new player to FUT.

**Micro Trading:** This technique is relatively simple. Find a player that costs between 4k-6.5k BIN cheapest. Then search for that player in any formation undercutting that BIN by about 1.5k, odds suggest you'll get one of them, and when you get it, you can put it up slightly below the average BIN for a relatively easy 1.5k profit. Again, this an easy, basic technique, that takes little time, so if you are able to get to that money

**Macro Trading:** This technique is the complete opposite of the previous technique. In this technique, and find this payers average price. Then search for either a BIN or open bid, (prefferably a BIN) and hope to find a good bid. The advantage of this technique is that it can give some fantastic returns. In the past I have made 30k profits off one deal after sitting down for 10 minutes. On the flispside though, this technique can provide little to nothing on some days, even thoug you have been there for two hours. This technique as well requires about 40k to be able to afford any player, so this is not a starter technique.

**Niche trading:** This technique is all about understanding a specific demand, but if done correctly can turn over huge profits, simply because of your knowledge of the market, and your ability to pick a good deal with anyone. You will need extreme understanding of the market to do this technique, but is easy and unstrenuous once you do understand it.

**Investing:** This techniques name says it all. Invest in a player, his price became ridiculous. The same can be said for anyone used in KSI's beast videos. They were cheap, then became expensive because of publicity. The only way to plan for these are to buy some relatively good silvers, maybe with 5 star skill and hope there price shoots up for some reason (probably publicity).

There are hundreds of more methods I could go into

To find any players average price

**1^st Edit:** Due to recent speculation throughout the market, be careful trading at the moment. The market is very unstable, ands what may be a good deal one day, could be an amazing one on the next, and what could be a relatively slim profit could turn into a loss the next day. Simply, don't put all your eggs in one basket and go for that 120k trade, that will only give you a 2k profit.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_FIFA/comments/10p5ic/the_communtiy_trading_guide_of_fut_13/

* 1. Clinical finishing
* 2. Not Beating Yourself

One of the big ways players tend to beat themselves is on Goal Kicks. In this tip
________________
The goal kick may be the closest thing to a positioning ""glitch"" in Fifa 13 as it puts the team taking the kick at such a disadvantage. So much can go wrong. If the kicker attempts to pass to one of the CBs or FBs at the edge of the box, stronger CBs. This can lead to a quick counter with a powerful header from a CB to a forward leaving the team that took the kick's defense out of position and chasing. These against the run-of-play scoring chances can change the game and should always be avoided. 

So what do you do on a goal kick to maintain possession and avoid easy giveaways? Here's what most of the top Div. 1 players I've seen do. 

Chip it to the full back. That's it. Don't boot it. NEVER pass it along the ground. Chip it to the full back. If your taking the goal kick from the right side

This method has proven to be the best way to maintain possession off a goal kick without the potential of giving up scoring chances. The chipped pass is much tougher for the defending team to cleanly intercept and create a shot

If your opponent decides to defend the fullback, put 3 bars power and just kick it out of bounds. 

On the other hand

Fifa 13 can be a tough game with often small details determining the difference between winning and losing

1359998615.0,17virr,FUT Squad Building 101,dwaters11,50,9,21,"**THIS POST UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Since this has got some popularity and people have been adding on to what I have I'll be reformatting and adding in details from other posters.

***Intro***

Due to the popularity of the weekly thread (which can be found on the sidebar and banner at the top) and the fact that we **still** get tons of posts asking to build teams

It has become tiresome and annoying to see people posting in the weekly thread with no preferences what so ever other than a budget. It's important for you to pick a formation you're comfortable with or a league you think you will enjoy playing in order to get the most 'fun' out of FUT. And no

In addition to www.futhead.com another site with an active member in our community (JuicyORiley) has been working on is www.futwiz.com . I personally started FUT using futhead so that's what I use but songs of praise have been sung for both sites

*Now to the good part!*


***Budget***

You should start off with knowing how much you plan to spend on this team so you can better assess your options. If you don't know how much you're willing to spend you don't know what type of team you can plan for. Keep in mind formations influence the cost of a player.


A piece of advice for new players looking to expand their budget from **Zikerz**:

&gt;When i offer advice to any new FUT player ever


***Picking a nation/league***

Next thing for me, Bundesliga, Russian League, SPL, BBVA, Serie A, and Ligue 1 teams. Almost any league can be competitive! As an example of diversity the [highest rated team on futhead](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/137601/) is a powerhouse silver team.


***Browsing available players***

After I settle on a nation/league I go through using the [player search function](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/) with filters on the nationality/league I picked and look at all the positions one by one. This gives me a sense of strong and weak points in the nation/league and I can better pick a formation. For example

***Deciding on a formation***

Now that you have an overview of all the available players it's time to pick a formation. I mostly go with experience here. Having played FIFA religiously since 07 I've tried almost all of them and know which fit my play style. As mentioned before

***Filling out the roster***

Now that you have your nation/league and formation you can start using the squad creator to fill out your team. While doing this it can be beneficial to look for possible areas to hybridize by looking for popular nations or teams to provide links with. Perfect chem is same team same nation. In order to get chemistry your players need to either be in the same league or from the same nation. A tip for hybridizing is to have a cluster of the same people from the same team to boost chem. For example you could use Man City on the left side of a defense with Clichy/Kompany/Hart and the right side be Bayern Munich with Lahm/Boateng/Schweinstager at CDM. I'm not 100% sure that comes out to full chem...don't take my word for that particular set up.

Since my explanation is pretty bad

&gt;I think to seriously have a squad building 101
Making hybrids is very easy once you understand the system. To get a player on 9 chemistry
There are 3 different links that a player can have; league, here are some examples:

&gt;Koscielny and David Luiz = 1 point (league)

&gt;Koscielny and Mangala = 1.5 points (nation)

&gt;Koscielny and Kaboul = 2.5 points (league+nation)

&gt;Arteta and Wilshere = 2.5 points (league+team)

&gt;Arteta and Cazorla = 4 points (league+nation+team)

&gt;Those are the 5 different combinations. If you look at [this team] (http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/4974671/)

Another addition from **teutonic**

&gt;Well each link a player has with another player, so he needs to get a minimum of 6 chemistry points from those 6 links.


***A run through of the process***

Here's an example of a [team I built](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/5139420/) and I'll run you through my thought process. I started with wanting to build a team with Robben

I usually start at the top when making a team so I needed to find a link for Assaidi and Robben. To do this I needed either a Dutch player in the BPL or a Moroccan player in the Bundesliga. RvP was the obvious choice here but for less obvious choices or if you're just beginning use the player search function with the mentioned filters.

The next order of business was to get Robben to 9 chem. This was easily done as all of the positions he links to only needed to provide partial chem

Now for the hard part, and Santana at RCB to give Gundogan another strong link which completes the team.

Now that all players have 9 chem the team is successfully built. But the team is also pretty expensive so a way to cut the cost would be have Hummels at MCB (for perfect chem with Gundogan)

**Some futhead goodness**

I personally use futhead for my squad building purposes as it is what I am most comfortable. Aside from what has already been said there are some other cool features to use.

Most of the comments are annoying and irrelevant to how the players actually play in game. This is where the 'User Review' tab can come in handy ([example](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/202/reviews/)). These are long

The 'Similar Players' tab is also extremely [helpful](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/202/similar/). From here you can find alternate players from the same league or the same nation which can help in hybridizing.

Lastly

**Chemistry Manipulation**

As **Asco88** mentioned you can adjust your team in game while still getting full chemistry benefits. If you started with 100 chem of course.

For an expensive example of this I'll use the Bayern duo Robbery. So you want to use Ribery and Robben in a 4-2-3-1 because they are perfect for it, EA!

You will however need to use 2 of your 3 allotted subs in game. Enter the game with a full chem 4-2-3-1 squad with random CAMs (use bronze players for all I care). First touch you get on the ball pause and sub in Robben and Ribery on their respective sides at the ""CAM"" position. Because you had full chem to start with any subs will take on the chem of the squad so even at CAM Robbery will get the full stat boosts.

**Asco88** also adds:

&gt;Oh

&gt;Card stats are deceptive - They are (weighted) averages over a number of in-game stats that may not have much to do with what you want out of a player.

&gt;For an extreme example, because his finishing is low. (Those stats look good for a CDM, huh? Remember you can sub him on or move him from LB to CDM in game.)

**In conclusion:**

There is no magic to use here. The people that are giving suggestions in the mega-thread didn't just magically learn all of the players in the game. It can take some time and practice to recognize what players would work where. I'm not sure if I accomplished what I was trying to do here but all suggestions/additions are welcome.",,t5_2uh1s,1372190272.0,FUT,xbl,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_FIFA/comments/17virr/fut_squad_building_101/

**4-4-2:** The 4-4-2 is the simplest of fomations. For a new player, firstly, if you have attacking minded mids with low defensive workrates, it can quickly turn into a 4-1-5, and that you usually require relatively pacey forwards, and if that just isn't your playstyle (pace abuse) it is tough to play fluidly.

**4-4-1-1:** Identical to the 4-4-2

**4-3-3:** The 4-3-3 is a simple formation. Mids with good passing, all you need to do is push the ball out to your RW/LW and feed the ball in to a striker, and sooner or later you'll put a header past the keeper. The only downfall of this formation is that you can be overwhelmed in the mids against 4 or 5 mid formations.

**4-3-2-1:** Almost identical to the 4-3-3, givving you a situation with almost 3 strikers, while still giving you the width you get with a 3 upfront formation.

**4-1-2-1-2:** Probably the most favoured formation, while still having two central mids sitting further up and further down the pitch, it is hard to play against. The biggest setback of this formation is that, it will put you back serious coinage, especially on more expensive players. Even cheaper players can cost up to 5k more in formation. If you are willing to spend an extra 50k or so on a team, this is the formation for you.

**4-2-3-1:** Similar to the 4-1-2-1-2, as some love it and some hate it. It's best feature IMO is the ability to cut in and blast fromn distance with the CAM's, like the 4-2-2-2.

**4-2-2-2:** With 4 central mids and two strikers, its downfall is lack of width, which can be a let down for players of a certain style.

**4-3-1-2:** This formation, you can push wide with your CF to cross, play quick counter attacks with your 3 mids, or just hold it on the edge of the bx and shoot when you find space with all your attacking options. It really only lets you down on how fast it turns defense to attack if you don't get it out of your mids quickly.

**4-5-1:** Pretty simple. If you don't mind not being able to 1-2 pace abuse with two strikers, that, with so many pace abusers, a 5 mid formation doesn't suit there playstyle, as you only really have on counter attacking option.

So if for whatever reason you are unaware of the stat updates (which happen almost every week) a list of the updated player ratings can be found at http://sofifa.com/en/fifa13winter/player/active

Since they are constantly updating the stats

2. Overalls are the stupidest things I have ever seen in my life. They are broken

Jumping/Height/Weight/Work Rates and many other stats have literally NO EFFECT on a strikers rating. Falcao would still be a 90 with 1 jumping. So when you're arguing who should be ""downgraded"" and ""upgraded"" talk about which stats should go up or down rather than the overall ratings.

For example, the only real issue with him is that his handling has been suspect in a lot of cases (See Southhampton game). Well lets look at his stats. 

Diving - 86

Handling - **76**

Kicking - 79

Positioning - 81

Reflexes - 88

Oh wow look

I first noticed this when researching the first IF that Miroslav Klose got this year. It just seemed that there was no possible way that an 84 rated striker could have 99 finishing, the result is a striker with a rating of 89!

Being able to consult Futguide.com to find this out for all IF players was really cool. We pay big premiums for the stat upgrades that go with In Form and TOTY/S cards. What are we really paying for? This site answered that question! Then the blogger stopped posting after TOTW 31. Just a bit before the TOTS cards came out. 

So for the past few days

Bold players are the ""best buys""

Italic players are the opposite.

BPL

**TOTS Benteke 81 -&gt; 87**

TOTS Cazorla  89 -&gt; 92

TOTS Michu    84 -&gt; 85

**TOTS Arteta   85 -&gt; 89**

So I didn't get to do all of them

The first being that EA is blatantly lying to us about the ratings of the vast majority of IF and TOTS cards. I'm not sure what that means

The second being that if the handicap does in fact exist

1367427441.0,1dhoha,Paddy's Pub - FUT Trading Tips,paddydignam,40,5,15,"Alright lads

This is my first post on reddit

I'm wondering if people would be interested in a trading-based thread where I would share some of the more successful trading tips I've used during FUT 13.

I maintained a trading thread on the EA forums where I started with 10K and traded my way to 3 million in eight weeks and am now interested in doing something similar on reddit (the EA thread can be found [here](http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/2271527.page#23488133)).

The trading spreadsheet I kept to track my progress is in a Google document that can be accessed by [clicking here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiLTXokCZbKMdGlPVkppMU1fcGZBd1lUWk1YY3FvNUE&amp;usp=sharing)

**My first trading tip is to capitalise on hype bubbles.**

A ""hype bubble"" is a temporary spike in the market for a specific player when that player scores

A few examples of hype bubbles over the past few weeks - 

I had been following the RVP market before last Monday's Manchester United and bought five or six before the game for an average price of 22K each.

After he scored the first goal

I was able to recognise that RVP's price was going to rise and picked up a bunch more cards after the first goal.  I ended up making 65K+ in about an hour.  Not too bad.

A more extreme example is how Dortmund's Lewandowski rose from ~2K to ~20K during last week's game where he scored four goals.

Obviously, it can pay off in a big way.

For example, which is insane! :)

So

**My second trading tip is to learn to love consumables. :)**

This isn't earth-shattering trading advise by any means, but I think it's worth it to highlight this method now, given that the market as a whole is very unstable right now and the consumables market has been largely unaffected.

First

I'll usually grind it out for an hour or so and pick up 100+ cheap consumables to sell off over the course of a few days.  I'll usually make ~1K per card

Here's a few screenshots of my web app watchlist from last week's foray into the formation market -

I wanted to use the highest NIF rating team I could make with around 120k coins also to see if I noticed any sort of handicap
http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/14186303/

I kept track of rating, passing percentage, dribbling completion percentage, saves, and shots against on goal.





Falcao: I had used him before, because unless you have an 85+ pace striker, through balls don't work too well in the 4-5-1. His passing was better than I expected and a lot of my play would run through him so that was nice. And of course, in the air he's incredible.

Goals: 30

Assists: 6

Passing %: 76.8

Dribbling %: 82.2

AVG rating: 7.73




Modric: I had only used Modric for several games before I made this team. I didn't have extremely high expectations

Goals: 8

Assists: 11

Passing %: 79.5

Dribbling %: 78.2

Avg Rating: 7.43




Ozil: Ozil was probably biggest letdown of the team. I expected him to produce a lot but I didn't get much. I 
often had to pass back because I just couldn't work around defenders. His workrate let him down too in this squad

Goals: 4

Assists: 6

Passing %: 86.5

Dribbling %: 79

Avg Rating: 7.5




Iniesta: I was super excited about using Iniesta since I had never used him before, was was extremely accurate from all over the field. 

Goals: 15

Assists: 10

Passing %: 84

Dribbling %: 81.8

Avg Rating: 7.55




Di Maria: By far my favorite player in the team was Di Maria. I hadn't used him much before but my goodness does he have ridiculous offensive abilities. It was too easy to get an open shot and score with him from the wing. I've used Robben before extensively and Di Maria played a lot better for me. He could also get back and help Joao on defence which was great.

Goals: 18

Assists: 7

Passing %: 75.2

Dribbling %: 87

Avg Rating: 7.78




Xavi: I had also never used Xavi before this experiment
and passing combination was perfect for a central midfielder. If he was a little bigger and stronger he'd be a lot more expensive.. I was still impressed with his defensive abilities though. 

Goals: 4

Assists: 17

Passing %: 77.7

Dribbling %: 93.5 (WTF)

Avg Rating: 7.55




Alba: I was worried about Alba getting up to far but that 90 pace is there for a reason. I didn't expect much but he far exceeded those expectations. Great passer and dribbler

Goals: 1 (Nasty long shot)

Assists: 2

Passing %: 89.5

Dribbling %: 83

Avg Rating: 6.72




Pepe: Pepe was probably the player I had used the most prior to this team and he was just like before, Strength, Heading, Height is all great on Pepe. 

Goals: 2

Assists: 0

Passing %: 84.3

Dribbling %: 65

Avg Rating: 6.83




Mascherano: My least favorite player on the team. His stats look good and everything but for whatever reason

Goals: 0

Assists: 0

Passing %: 79.5

Dribbling %: 62.3

Avg Rating: 6.65




Joao: Not great

Goals: 0

Assists: 3

Passing %: 86.7

Dribbling %: 74.3

Avg Rating: 6.82




Valdes: By far the most surprising player on the team. I didn't expect much of anything, Positioning becomes the most important GK attribute and that's where Valdes shines. He was never out of place. Even on breakaways he would be at just the right angle to stop 
the shot.

Saves: 152

Shots against on goal: 184

Save %: 82.6

Avg Rating: 7.53




My record during the 30 games was 21-5-4 which is much better than my avg record on FUT. I had a ton of fun making this and I just though I would share

Basically it's a five-back formation, they're used primarily to attack and distribute the ball. In a pinch a good LM or RM should be able to steal the ball, or at least pressure the opponent enough for them to make a bad pass, or give your CBs enough time to track back and mark their man.

If you're poor at defending and rely on other players to help (such as using the right bumper to call another player to help you defend) then I suggest you use a different formation. The strength of the formation is based upon the players being in their right spots to easily distribute the ball, your CBs marking all the wrong people, and you'll end the game frustrated and angry. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Now, pacy CBs definitely help minimize mistakes that are made when defending one-on-one, and being able to quickly switch to a midfielder to cover the opponent while your CB gets back into position also helps. Don't lean on these tactics though; learn how to be a good defender!

Offensively, and the 2 CDMs. In a 3-4-2-1, you're attacking with around 5 guys: either the LM/RM (sometimes both), a CM, and the LF/RF and ST (total of 5). If you make one guy miss, you're now five on five. If you make another player miss, you're four on five. Regardless of that, with the LM racing up the field, and ST to deal with a CB

You've got a lot of space to move the ball around as well; usually one CM stays back to defend, RF, ST, and the Left CM (LCM) with ease. That creates a lot of options for the attacker, and leaves the defense puzzled as to what will come next. Be careful overusing the through-ball pass though, as it'll tire out your offense, get intercepted, use the regular pass

**Players:**

Here I’ll be talking about work rates

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CBs:
You want them fast and strong. Think Santana, Ramos, Ogbonna, Chiellini, Gamberini, Boateng.

Work rates: High-Medium (only one per squad), Low-High (one per squad, your CBs will help intercept and get the balls to the CMs; they can't do that when they're not up close enough).

Reasoning: This is pretty simple, and they’ll never be able to properly distribute the ball to your CMs. You can have 3 medium-medium CBs, but I would always recommend having at least one defender that will stay back and do his job, which is to defend! Remember: These guys are the last line of your defense, and there’s only three of them! If you’re giving your opponent one-on-ones with your GK, then I don’t care if your GK is TOTY Casillas, balls will slip through

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LM/RMs: 

Speed is good here, and crosses pretty well then that'd work too. Gaitian and Maria are two great examples of what I consider the perfect LM/RM, but I've used Neymar (who for some reason is godly at LM) and IF Farfan who also get the job done; it all depends on your ability do defend (remember, if your CB whiffed on the ball, you'll have to contain him with a LM, CM, or RM).

Work rates: High-Medium, but you're more than welcome to try it.

Reasoning: Your LM/RMs would be your LWB/RWB in a 5-back formation, their ability to defend will really depend on you: if you’re poor at anticipating where the pass is going to go, or can’t hold your own one-on-one with the opponent, you’ll want a more defensive LM/RM (Gaitain, Maggio comes to mind). However, if you can steal a ball, get a more attacking midfielder! It really depends on you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMs: One has to be defensive

Defensive:

Doesn't have to be too pacey, De Rossi, Javi Martinez, Khedira. Work rates: Medium-High, Low-Medium (be careful with this one, I haven't tried this one out too extensively). You don't want low-high, because then they won't help attack. They don't need to be shooting the ball

Reasoning: If your LM/RM miss, you’ll ALWAYS be susceptible to counter attacks, and the 3-4-2-1 will fail against a seasoned player. 

Offensive:

Doesn't need to be pacey, and can defend if called upon. Think IF Banega, Schweinsteiger. Work rates: Medium-Medium, High-High. I wouldn't go for a high-medium/medium-low guys because they won't track back and help defend as much as they should. Stick with guys with even work rates.

Reasoning: You can definitely have two defending CMs, they have to distribute the ball, and take a shot when the chance comes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LF/RF: Basically anything. Just make sure they're in the right spot at the right time. This position is easy to fill, Medium-Medium/low.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ST: I don't like high-high, medium-medium/low, and that's it. However, if you can work with a high-high, go for it! Just know, they’ll drop back into the midfield a bit more than they should, and that gets annoying after awhile!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Tips:**

*Don't be afraid to pass back!* I think a lot of people using the 3-4-2-1 think you always have to keep moving up, your LM/RM, and let the defense create holes for you!

*Through balls in the air will be your friend!* When you're passing the ball with your ST

*Cross it!* Use your LM/RMs to race up the field (when there's a hole) and see if you can get some crossing going! Basically you've got three guys who could get that ball into the net. If you can't make a shot

*Set your play style to defensive!* Keeps your guys from running around too much, you won't have much of a need to go to attacking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now you know the basics! 

Want a cheap 3-4-2-1 squad to try it out? Have no fear! Here’s a cheap squad that should be in your budget! (I’m talking 14k Xbox

Sadly, he should be able to track back and help defend when the time comes!

For context

**So what happened?**

Just prior to EA shutting down FUT13 auctions to fix the issue

Because of his access to the market


&gt; As far as I can tell somebody figured out how to bid without having the coins to back up the bid. This started on Thursday or maybe even earlier. Last night the cat came out of the bag and the exploit was rampant. My estimate is that we could see over a milliard coins added to the economies both on Xbox and PS3. 
The effects were immediately noticeable in the IF market where a huge buying spree started. 
EA haven't gotten back to me yet with additional info.

**What's the impact?**

&gt; This morning I had the hope that those bids were actually not completing and therefore the coins weren't going to end up in the economy. But alas
This will take weeks to settle down.

**What's EA doing about this?**

While EA have acted slowly on this issue

They repeated this tweet four times in the last 10 hours. Sounds kinda critical

**Update from JP flathead (owner of ultimatedb.nl
http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/2118372.page
&gt; Just to make one thing clear first

&gt; The 15M bid thing was a complex exploit used by a small group of people whose sole purpose was to destroy the FUT economy. The hole that the managed to exploit has been found and plugged by EA. 
It will take some time to find and ban all the offending accounts on both Xbox and PS3. I do know that the people in Vancouver are working overtime to get it cleaned up as soon as they can.

**Further update from JP on the cause of the exploit**
&gt;I just received feedback from EA. The exploit is indeed iOS App related (not mine!) They have fixed things and are working on getting FUT up and running again.

Video's explaining the process:

PS3: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHlsR0c8EFU)

XBOX: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkQPOuhbAgg)

PC: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGAcd8vjyik)

Written Directions (not gonna lie

For PS3 users: 

1. Copy them over to the PS3 via flashdrive/cd etc. Go to Music and find your Disc or MP3 player or USB etc.

2. FIFA will access Chants from a set playlist. You have to create these playlists. If you've already copied them they should have automatically assembled themselves as an album i.e. all Bradford songs should be in a Bradford file....highlight this, create playlist, name it...""Bradford Chants"" etc. wallah, you have your playlist.....if you haven't added them to your console yet go to Music on your PS3, then Playlists&gt;Create New Playlist, then name the playlist a specific club, i.e. Bradford. Then, just find the specific ""album"" you've just installed

You can do 1 and 2 in any order. i.e. you can name playlists before you install the files. ALTHOUGH if you insall the audio first, there's no need for a keyboard! 
For Entrance music and Goal Music etc. These are indvidual files. Just leave them in the folder. You've only made a playlist for the above because they have many files. Entrance music etc. only has one. Therefore

For Xbox 360 users: 

As you'll know there are lot of problems facing 360 owners, to file names...the following explanation was made some time ago, instead you may want to follow the instructions in this thread: [Here](http://forum.ea.com/uk/posts/list/12471.page)

File name transfering from PC to 360 is becoming a bit of enigma

Anyway

1. It's the same process as for the PS3, the 360 does not recognise DVD-RW or CD-RW discs. 

2. You will need to make the CD a ""Audio CD"", means that you'll need more than one cd, as most programs won't let you write more than ""a given number"" of tracks on the cd. So even though you'll have more than enough space in terms of MB, you won't be able to finish the cd if you have to many files. 

3. To then make a custom soundtrack


If you find that certain audio is too loud or too quiet
Open the specific file(s) and increase or decrease volume by Select All&gt;Effect&gt;Amplify&gt;Extract as MP3

I'm adding more statistics regularly and doing further integration with Google Charts. What's missing right now is form curves and a better presentation of past results.

Further features planned are attaching squads to matches. This would allow to show statistics of each player's goals per match

Don't know if anyone has any use for this kind of functionality but now it's out there.

Big thanks goes out to the guys over at Futwiz for supplying the player database used for searching goalscorers.

1366413139.0,1cpgv0,What I think we deserve from EA in FIFA 14.,ChedduhBob,27,7,37,"Before I even write this there are a few things:

1. This will be extremely long.
2. Let's be honest: None of the stuff I mention will be addressed.
3. I primarily play FUT and Seasons. I have played zero Pro Clubs and a small amount of career mode. If there is something that you would like to mention from these game modes
4. The limited stuff I saw from the previews seem dumb as shit. Rather than focus on a game that clearly needs fixing they add a stutter step before you shoot

One of the first things many people would like to see is fixed animations/player momentum issues. What do I mean by this? The players do a lot of stupid unrealistic things. The jump over the ball may be the most unrealistic thing implemented in a FIFA game I have ever seen. Not only does it slow your player down to the point that it typically kills any counter attack you had, and then my player starts to stumble a good 8 yards. I have no idea where this momentum would come from. My player was not moving fast, so how could he develop so much momentum so quickly. I know some of you may be thinking, ""WELL A CRUSHING TACKLE WOULD KNOCK HIM DOWN!"" Yes, that is true, but for my player to stumble forward several yards, there is something wrong with the game.

The next thing I am going to talk about may be the elephant in the room, but I havent seen a well developed argument against it. Here is mine. The problem does not lie with attacking in any way shape or form. The area that must be fixed is defending. The way the system is currently set up, all defenders mark pretty much flawlessly, are always in a perfect position, never get beaten while containing, and have tremendous tackle boxes(the area where they will initiate a tackle). When you take this into consideration, some may say that they need these things to combat pace. This isn't true in the slightest. What happens is that bad players can't beat these defenders against players that are pretty good, and this is how I thought the game worked. They build these teams with speed because defense is way unbalanced as it stands. What should they do? Positioning is a meaningless stat, and player positioning, and defending was useless. Making positioning more important and weakening the contain ability of defenders with poor stats would help to introduce redeeming qualities for defenders like Vidic

Next issue. Fix the goddamn economy. Playing the game should be more important than trading. Introduce things like challenges for players. Score a 5 minute hat trick in an online seasons match. Win the gold cup twice in 48 hours. The possibilities are endless. Maybe make a weekly challenge like score a hat trick with 10 different players. That would increase variety and present an opportunity to make coins more easily available. This along with increasing the card weight should make the prices more reasonable. Before we go on to the next point all i can say is LOLPCPRICES.

The next thing I think we should get are more tutorials. This doesn't apply to me as much, it is the best sports game franchise hands down. The tutorials in that game tell you everything. I think that FIFA should put in tutorials for all of the skill moves, and better defensive tactics.

Next is a direct gameplay issue that applies to all game modes. Heading basically seems like a crap shoot to me. I have had Messi win headers of players like Pepe and Thiago Silva. That would literally happen maybe 1/1000 times in real life. It would happen, and in real life the last thing any one is doing on defense is planning for an aerial assault from him. Also some of that is positioning as well. If you notice on the break what happens is your defenders run a little bit past the attacker, in what I think is an effort to hold a line, and typically they don't make it back to the striker and lose the header. I know in one of the previous points I mentioned that positioning should be a big impact, and made worse for a lot of players, but, to me anyways

I just wrote a ton and I can't think of anything I think EA has fucked up royally on. These may be a product of rage, I could talk about FIFA all day. 

Thank you for making it this far into the post if you did!

](http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11742797/)


**SIF Klose:** Right place, it doesn't matter if your CB has 99 pace, Klose is getting to that ball before he does. Stronger than his stats, reliable as a rock in the box, and deadly in the air. All of this, for 28k. I can only imagine if he'd gotten a TOTS card...

**Reus:** needs no introduction. If you haven't tried him

**Gotze:** Surprisingly good for me, and equaled only by Neymar's. NEVER loses his footing, even when he loses the ball, which means he spends less time on the ground and more time fighting to get the ball back. Very hard worker for me despite the m/m workrates. Excellent short passing game, wish his long passing was better, though. A reliable finisher in the box as well, provided you aren't too far away from the keeper.

**Robben:** Actually feels like 93 pace

**Neymar:** Incredible dribbler. When I've got a comfortable lead, and he's off to the races. Also amazingly quick, and stops on a dime. Got a mean shot on him, too, and the best finesse - bar Robben's - that I've tried on this year's FIFA.

**Marchisio:** A bit of a hit-and-miss to be perfectly honest, the keeper's going to have to earn his keep...

**Gilherme Santos:** Interesting little player. Obviously he's here just to keep Neymar chemistry-happy, but is completely average when compared to the next guy on this list:

**Lahm:** Where do I begin? I legitimately cannot remember the last time someone faced up to him, never loses his footing, is simply solid down his flank, doesn't get too far forward... can't say enough about him. Great passer, too. Doesn't have much of a shot on him, but you don't buy your RBs to score you goals, do you?

**Ogbonna:** Also needs no introduction. He's better than Chiellini. Harder-working, and Stronger, somehow. I feel like you could pair him with anybody in back and he'll keep things together. Tied with Thiago Silva as my favourite CBs this FIFA. Bonus: scores headers from corners for fun. If you get 5 corners in a game - and you know how to use your corners - you can rest assured he'll nod at least one of those in for you.

**Chiellini:** Not much to say about him. Also pretty good, less awesome Ogbonna. Still monstrous, though, but given the chance I'd just clone Ogbonna. Either way, neither of them have too much work when they're backed by the next player:

**SIF Handanovic:** Oh. My. Word. This guy. This guy, he does double-saves on the regular, he saves penalties like a fiend... and his throwing! His throwing! He just pitches the ball out to the halfway line without a sweat. Is without a doubt the best keeper I've used on ANY fifa. He's better than Casillas, Buffon, IF Adler, Sirigu, Marchetti, Lloris... and for under 50k? Are you kidding? Is the main reason I can't switch out the back line for a Dede-Thiago Silva-Artur Moraes combo. I just gotta have him in there.

***Stud of the squad award:*** Split between SIF Klose and SIF Handanovic. Both of them save my bacon way

I have used every player that is worth a lot of coins outside of Team of the Years, those skills, that pace, and that strength in one package. He can shred through the most sweaty 352 defenses, whether it be Santana and David Luiz, or Chiellini and Ogbonna they might as well be bronzes because they stand no chance. Combining his pace with what most would view as the best skill move in the game (the running scoop turn) turns into a lethal combination. He also has the best shot in the game. I know a lot of people will claim that Messi is better because of his higher finishing, but once you get to the 90s it is all the same. The thing that sets Ronaldo apart from Messi is Ronaldo's immense shot power. The ball is sent out like a fucking cannon and while Messi may be able to tuck it in on the finesse with either foot, Ronaldo's ability to execute with either foot makes him a better choice. 

He also is ridiculously good at some other things that set him farther apart. I don't know if it is just me, and he can play any through ball to any player. His free kicks do suffer a bit from accuracy, but I did score a bunch, when only putting a slight amount of power on it. 

Another thing to note is people, but if you lose expect to be messaged. I didn't realize that buying a card on Ultimate Team clearly meant that I was homosexual, and that I have no life.

I know a lot of people like to see squads so here are the two I used: 

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/8877719/

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/8698861/

I started out with the first, but it was so much fun because it gave me everything I needed in a squad.

I don't know what else to say about him. 68 goals in 25 games should be enough to say. Is he worth it? Absoulutely, like me, are a Madrid super fan there is no reason to buy him right now. You could build like 4 incredible teams for that money. Overall though he is the best plaer in the game, and that was just his regular card. Good luck to anyone who manages to get him, he's a blast to play with.

PKs can be excruciating. At times it will seem like you never guess the right direction. PKs can frustrate players to point of completely losing their mental edge. And shootouts? Losing a shootout can put anyone on suicide watch. So what's the secret? The secret is to take your head out the game and trust the odds. 


**PKs**

Pick a side right now. Left or right. Chose one. From now on this is your side. Every time you get a PK, oh well, the odds will come back to you eventually. 
This simple tip has allowed me to be a much more level headed player and not think myself out of matches. When my opponent blocks it

**Shootouts**

Shootouts are a bit different because an intelligent opponent can eventually catch on to your game. I haven't lost a shootout since I don't know when. Here's the shootout secret. 


On your first PK, on the next four, resume going in your chosen PK direction. 


For goalie, resume diving in the same direction.

1370032944.0,1ffcx0,Guide for playing 4-2-2-2.,Footy_Fanatic,18,3,12,"I rarely come up against a 4-2-2-2 and when I do it's usually just someone trying their hardest to pacewhore. I don't know why these types of people don't just use a 4-4-2.

So here's my guide to help you play a 4-2-2-2 and try out a new formation!

**4-2-2-2 Guide**

So with the 4-2-2-2 you're going to be passing a lot. Passing, Passing, and Ball Control in no particular order.

The style of play is not direct and it is direct. What I mean by this is

*Position Breakdown*

**Striker:** So you're going to want both of your strikers to have decent passing

**CAM:** Your CAMs are NOT wingers. They will NOT hug the line, and beat people 1 on 1. 

The second med/med cam should have good ball control, or juninho. I'm not talking 90+, just make sure this guy has at least 75+.

Alternative: Any workrates will work

**CDM:** One CDM needs to be med/high or low/high. The other is my workhorse

The first low/high CDM is your true CDM. He sits back and reads play and protects your back 4. He is also used in combination play and distribution

The high/high workhorse CDM is your utility man. He needs pace, and decent defending stats. I love ramires in this role. He has the pace to be EVERYWHERE, the stamina, and the stats.

Alternative: Both can be low/high or med/high. I just prefer to have one Ramires like workhorse. 

**Center Back:** The only workrate requirement here is that he can not have high attacking workrates. 

**Fullbacks:** These are the most important players on your defense. If they suck you will get beat on the wings 24/7 because the CAMs dont help much. Make sure they are solid defensively with okay pace. I like Sagna( perfect defensive fullback example) and Clichy(has the pace to make up for his workrates.)

**GK:** Whoever your prefer. However if you defend well you will want a shot stopper. Also don't be afraid to try a keeper who previously sucked

**Tips:** Don't be aggressive with your backline. Maybe practice playing on defensive. 

Most good players play on defensive.

Don't play too direct or you will get frustrated.

Remember to pass, pass, pass, dribble.

On seasons the perfect team for this is Man City.

Do not use this formation with a mediocre team(3 star or lower on seasons)

**Two pre-made teams**

Expensive-ish: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11440902/   (Mandanda is a legend for me. I swear its formation dependant.)

Budget: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11443522/

(The cost listed on Futhead is very very wrong.)

Enjoy playing with the 4-2-2-2. :)

I am extremely disappointed in this year's community, are too slow, and that you should use Walcott or Biabiany instead. I completely understand *why* people need more pace this year. The game simply got more competitive, and that is nothing anyone can do anything about apart from Electronic Arts themselves. But please. Let's be realistic here, you don't need 96 pace. You never will, even if you play against the same Santana-Dede partnership every game, you don't need that pace.

Can you change a players formation preference?  I saw something mentioned that led me to believe it can be converted for money or something.  Not sure.

What time should I set for my trades?  I know for me I avoid stuff that closes after multiple hours because if it's something I want I want to be there at the end for the bidding war.  Is that the same across the board?


Will there be new manager tasks?  I completed the first set today.  

EDIT:

Also:  For flips sake.  When playing using Tele camera.  regular settings (not manual)  If I'm a breakaway, pushing the stick to the right would end up shooting it straight at the goal?  Or does the stick represent the goal, so to the right would mean right side of the goal?  I hope this is clear.

1363942341.0,1asgej,I know this is a subreddit dedicated to FIFA but there really isn't a community for PES. I'd like to know some of your thoughts on the game.,jpwasson,22,5,26,"I just downloaded PES 2013 from Steam and have put about 4 hours of gameplay into it. Let me just say

The balance and fluidity of the game seems so much better than FIFA. Defending requires a great amount of skill. Outrageous goals are rarely scored. Attacking requires implementation of actual strategy instead of quick fire counter attacks. Players make smart runs and seem to actually try and place themselves in a positive position. 

To be completely honest

The single and online play of PES can't really compete with FIFA right now. The single player manager mode lacks depth and replay value. The Champions League presentation is great but their is very little youth scouting and recruitment and the transfer negotiations are somewhat strange. PES is of course also missing alot of the licensing rights that FIFA has. That was easily worked around on PC though. I downloaded a patch that revamped all the rosters and added all team crests and various leagues from across the world. And the big factor... Ultimate Team. I adore ultimate team. I have so much fun creating different squads and playing with various hybrids. It's all I basically do on FIFA and could be the deciding factor in which game I buy next year. 

So what are your thoughts on PES compared to FIFA? I'd love to have a little discussion and see some opinions.

TLDR: Played PES for the first time in a couple years and was incredibly impressed. Gameplay is better than FIFA IMO. Yet the single player doesn't measure up.

* Drag and drop for changing players.
* Inserting players defaults them to the position you are putting them as opposed to their default card position.
* Now includes the 7 members of the bench.
* Will give you a star rating including the bench so you can use your sweaty bronze bench to see if you qualify for the 4* tournament :p

I wasn't sure if this was something that you guys would want to read or not but i thought i would share my opinion on a few expensive players i have used this year. My reasoning for this is simple

As you can see i lined up in the 4-3-1-2 with Gotze player at the CF position

**Strengths** - Obviously his key attribute is his Dribbling

Another key point to his game was passing

**Weaknesses**  - Physically you're probably struggle up against big strong defenders and CDM's but his ability to move away from players and into space should counter this.

Again height wise you are going to struggle he is only 5'9''


**Hybrid Possibilities** - If you are going to play his guy and Reus at ST in most formations you will be fine because it will always get perfect 9 chemistry opening you up to almost every single permutation of hybrid.

**Best Position** - Defiantly CF but still a world class CAM. Wasted at CM

1361762916.0,1965r1,My Weekend With Messi. (Player Review),ChedduhBob,13,0,9,"I got incredibly bored with Ultimate Team just due to the fact that I have played so much I have used just about every player in the game (Barring TOTY players and Ronaldo's Regular card). I decided to sell my team entirely and just buy Messi and eventually i traded my way up to this beast through some ridiculous deals http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/6397198/ so anyways without further adieu here is my review.

Messi is the best player I have used in Ultimate Team this year. He is hands down the best dribbler, Schweinstegger, etc.) If you use him i would reccomend a Cam or CF role because at striker you're kind of cutting his passing short. The last thing I will say about his skills is that his free kicks are underrated, but they are absolutely phenomenal. I don't want to brag, but i am pretty clinical with free kicks within 25 yards and players like Ribery, Nasri and IF Diego are the types of players i like to use, and Messi performs very similar to them. His free kicks and corners are beautiful.

Now sadly the card isnt without its flaws. This first problem is a bit of a personal one, the opposing players play completely different. When they see you have messi the first thing that they do is send you a series of messages asking how you got him, and then they freak out if you lose. I am an above average player, but i lose in division one every now and then. The people act like they just won a Champions League final and they proceed to give you shit talking that rivals a Joey Barton twitter tirade. Plus for those of you that dont like ""Sweaty Goals"" Brace yoursleves. Messi is an open invitation. 

One more final note, but for the sake of the post lets just say each star is 20% of the regular stats. 60% of Messi's shooting stats is still incredible.

My opinion is that  Balotelli is a lot more of a quality striker and a lot lot better than aguero. He has the finishing, dribbling, strenght, heading. Aguero just have the dribbling and finishing. 88 pace on the card is like 81 and balotelli is so much faster. 

Aguero is very weak and looses the ball often against defenders very often. The best thing hes got is his dribbling and finishing. But these two tools is not even near the 120k and hes not an allrounded striker, Podolski is much better and worth 100k less.

Before the review here is the squad: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/11045054/#

So Casillas in goal was one that I hadn't ever used before. I will say that he isn't much better than Neuer or Cech

The back 3 of Ramos, which is something that I like.

Nani and Robben are both incredible. I highly recommend both

The striker combination is beautiful, but I notice a huge difference in Balotelli. If you look at his stats in game, his Dribbling and Ball control have both gone up 5 and for me personally that is fantastic because I take on defenders with the LT+RT dribbling and LT a lot.

So now we are in the important stuff. Are the Spanish Trio worth it?

I'll start with Martinez: He's really good. The only thing is so is his regular. I can't really speak about his card that much because it is good not great. He doesn't have a great shot or pace (ZOMG YOU'RE A PACEWHOREEEE!!!!), and Bayern have a bunch of good CDMs in Schweinstegger, Gustavo and Tymo even. He isn't really worth it IMO.

Next is Arteta. He is the perfect CM. He has great dribbling for holding up the play, but I think he works best as a CM. He can stay in a 352 as a CDM just fine though. I noticed a HUGE difference in his regular and this card. He also is really cheap for a TOTS so pick him up if you get the chance.

Last is TOTS Cazorla. My. God. What a fucking player. The Best CAM in the game right now hands down. He has phenomenal passing stats and he has the touch of a tempur pedic mattress. He can just cut in and out of a defense and he also has a good bit of pace as well. If you get any space, or most other Long Shooters. The 5 star weak foot is awesome, and honestly I think I might like the left foot a little better. Cazorla is absolutely 150 percent worth it. I noticed a ridiculous upgrade from his normal card, and he is a must use if you ask me.

TL;DR: Arteta and Cazorla have a huge difference from the regular and Martinez is good

I need to know the amount of points in each division for staying in the division

The background for this is that I'm putting the final touches on a statistics tool for Ultimate Team players. Being unhappy with the fact that you can only view details of your last 3 matches

Its meant as a personal tool

Once the data collection is started I plan on doing all sorts with it. Facts such as your biggest win, what division you're in the most and so and so on. There's probably a lot of ideas as to what people would want statistics on. More ideas are welcome.

Right now it looks approximately like this: http://i.imgur.com/rG9RG8s.png

I plan on making a 2 click submission instead of the table of results. That is

I also had an idea about attaching Futhead links for squads on your timeline

It might also be fun to do this for tournaments.

I have no idea if anyone is interested in this besides me

So I urge you please. Help me with the points details of the divisions and please comment with ideas for the site.

**EDIT**:
I think I got all of them now. For Ultimate Team at least. I skimmed them off Youtube videos :D

I'll be contacting the winner with details on his prize.

---- 

As I recall last year there was an 11 nation tournament on FUT and it could be quite a challenge building high chem teams that worked within those requirements. So I made it a little harder than that for this challenge.

Requirements for challenge:

1. Must have 11 nations in the squad.  
3. Must be 9 chem across the board
4. Use Futhead.com for building.
2. The 11 nations must be confined to any of these 4 areas: 

* The Americas
* Europe (Russia counts as Europe) 
* Africa
* Asia and Australia. 

I'll pick a winner on Sunday. There's a prize of 5000 coins. You can be on any platform and win

That's the squad I used (except for 2 games with my rest team). I just sold off my two gold squads to make this one as my dream team for UT. 

Aguero and Balotelli have 16 and 18 goals respectively in the 27 games I've played and they're such a fucking dynamic pair. Aguero is the slippery little snake that can weave through anyone (as I like to say

Santi plays right behind the two, and can pass at absolutely any angle. I scored the most insane overhead goal with him and also had one of the best assists I've ever had in the same game with him. I can't really speak highly enough about him, and I wish I could afford the TOTS, but for the price, SIF Santi is a stallion.

Hazard and Navas play out super wide in 352. Navas is pretty worthless

Fellaini and Xabi seem like a perfect duo. I think my next upgrade is gonna be to get TOTS xabi. Fellaini is insane all around

The way Fellaini/Xabi interchange in the midfield makes it really easy to pass it around with Santi and the wingers. You can form triangles at any spot on the field at pretty much any point in the game. All of them can zip it around and outside of rain it's so simple to retain possession.

http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/12831631/
http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/12831538/

I made a silver team for the Silver tournament, but for me that is a crazy win percentage. I can sit here and confidently say that 5212 and 5221 are the best formations in the game. Hands down. Here are some things I want to clarify.

Claim 1: THE 352 IS MORE DEFENSIVE
If you think that is true, it has CDMs, but if you just put two defensive CMs, you are covered. Then, you may be able to put some defensive RMs and LMs in there, but there aren't enough options that are as good defensively as a standard LB and RB. The formation gives you 3 attackers in perfect position, deep lying wing backs and CMs in a position to dominate the middle of the pitch. You have plenty of options attacking and you have more than enough defensive options. Your players are in the perfect positions.

Claim 2: Hold possession to beat it.
That doesn't work. I had plenty of people try and they would have been just as effective if I used  a4 or 3 back formation. I think that notion just comes from the fact that possession style football is honestly an extremely effective way to play no matter how people claim that counterattacking is the only way to score in FIFA.

Claim 3: It only is effective e on the counter.

No. It is perfect for attacking in every way. You have wing backs that will push up if you like to cross, you have endless options. you are just being stupid if you say its only counter attacking

I don't know how to link it in text

This squad is extremely cheap, they will be able to be sold after for minimal losses.

I will start with the defense first. It is very sweaty, but I think he is just as strong as the other defenders. Wiese is a solid budget keeper as well, making this team difficult to score on.

In the midfield the two defensive mids are life savers. Gustavo is just a brick wall, but from just outside the box they can smash one in. 

The two outside mids are very good at cutting inside and scoring. Robinho has five star skills making him a bigger draw for some people

Next is the attacking trio. Bermudez was originally a chemistry placeholder because I didn't like the options at CAM, and what he lacks in strength he makes up for in balance. He has a decent shot, but he isn't a super goal scoring threat. If I could compare him to another player, I would say he feels like Nasri, who is my favorite CAM in the game. Next, is Quintero. He is one of the best 5 star skilling silvers in the game, at least for me. He has a solid shot and dribbling and he is great at setting up the other Attacking players. He has good enough speed, and he can't really set anyone else up, 93 acceleration, 92 jumping.... Those stats are unbelievable. He also has four star skills which is a great little bonus for those of us who like our ronaldo chops. He is the ultimate poacher

The squad is great, in regards to the midfield and defense, while still retaining the attacking trio. Robben will easily fit in for Shaqiri if you have the coin and the same as Neymar. I wouldn't reccomend those purchases now because their prices will only be going down more and more. Benitez also has a regular version who isn't bad as well and that will save you about 14-15k. This squad has room to grow, which is something I often look into for a cheap side. 

Cons: I guess Robinho isn't defensive enough for some, but I typically like to have one in the squad.

If you have any suggestions let me know! I love this squad

TL;DR: Here is a cheap side with some beast players. I love Benitez and you should give his SIF a go.

I advanced to the Toulouse game and started it. Everything seemed working good, until the game started, and I realized there was no ball. What the fuck. Quited the game immediatly and tried to find a solution. Quick googling helped and I started the game and changed the ball away from default to anything else. Well finally I got in game. 70 minutes played I lead 2-1 with one goal scored by one of my very promising youth player. I'm about to make my last changes and press start and you know what? Menu becomes unresponsive and I can't do anything. Everything seems to be working fine but I can't press any button or move anywhere in menu. My god I was angry at that moment. Quitted the game again, and started all over the same game. At the start of the game I'm listening things commentators say and heard that my team ''Should get promoted this year'' I didn't even know what to say anymore. I played the game, I won it 3-1 and my 1st ST got his elbow broken... Yup.
Went to see what my League objective really was and guess what? It was exactly ""Gain promotion"". Gain promotion? In League 1? What the actual fuck? I don't know if i get fired at the end of the season by not fulfilling that

So why don't we share our experiences on how to win those contested headers. Controls-wise

(Note I'll be using XBOX controller notation)

**Jockeying for Position**

* As far as I know
* Firstly
* Secondly
* Then you can either hold the trigger down vs repeatedly pressing the trigger(s).
* I've been using the spam LT + RT method, it doesn't seem to work as well.

**Heading the Ball**

* Again there's really 2 methods. I've a feeling that one is much more popular and is simply instinctively used by most people.
* Spamming the B button (most popular?)
* Double tapping the B button
* I've been doing the double tap method

Of course, etc., but that's really hard without visuals.

-Remy, putting him on par with Falcao's heading. The guy is an unbelievable poacher.

-Amalfitano RW/LW: Great short passing (86) and a decent cross (81) making him versatile for my poacher. I can cross it into Remy or create a play with his great passing. 4 star weak foot means I can play him on either wing

Once a game has been completed, you must send me the links to all of the pictures through imgur preferably. Only then can i sort out the rest. I would like to ask that the preliminary rounds are played by the 7/8/13 if possible, with a final closing date of 9/8/13. Anyone who hasn't completed the game by then will be disqualified, if you have tried to make contact and organise the game, with proof of this you will be put through

This is the final post for the tournament

No Attributes.

Disconnections to be replayed to where the disconnection occurred with the previous score.

Pictures or videos to be taken for proof of everything

The ideal photos to be taken are: In the prematch when you have both connected, the half time match details, full time match details, full time score (on menu where you leave the game). EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! Take a picture of the leaving match screen if a disconnection occurs, then take another picture of the point of recommencing the match, and the other details above.

There will be no ""best third place"" spots available

Time is up! If you haven't purchased the card now with the exception of ethaaaaan who has until 5pm GMT as i wasn't online. The draw will be made and announced soon

Instead of sending messages now

Here we go then, and then depending on how easily the amount of people fit into the next round (2,4,8 etc.) there may be a best 3rd place(s) available so watch your goal difference! The draw will be made by entering all of the names at random. The main details will be on the next post with all the fixtures and results being put on there so you can all keep updated, league tables will be published as well with goals for/against, Goal difference and points. Teams will play each person in the group once with the top two proceeding immediately. You will receive 3 points for a victory, 1 point for a draw

To sign up, Time zone (and possible active times). I will then reply with a players details to which you'll then purchase to complete entry into the tournament. As soon as you're entered you'll be added to the list on the next post. At 12 noon GMT tomorrow entry will close and the groups/prelims will be organised.

1375477679.0,1jl7uc,[XBL] Tournament Details!,JustRodger,8,2,13,"Right! So lots of people liked the idea of a tournament so I thought it'd be a good idea to get feedback on how it should be played and the buy in price and such

1) No attribute cards.

2) No disconnecting to earn a rematch if losing (Ill explain a bit more later)

3) Take pictures somehow of all proceedings in the game.

I think that's all but i'll add anymore if need be. By taking pictures of your opponents team, score and time of disconnection (If it occurs). This is just to be able to allow for everything to flow smoothly and will help stop people saying ""Oh I won 5-0 but i don't have any proof"" blah blah. If you've got a recorder, please record, it'd save a lot of hassle! Disconnections will be sorted by getting the time and score back to what it was before the disconnection and then proceeding to finish the game. Also i know the issue of trust will be a problem for some due to what has happened in the past, i can assure you that it won't happen with me. But anyway, that's why the option is there for a 1k buy in, build some trust first!",False,fut,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_FIFA/comments/1jl7uc/xbl_tournament_details/
