I've been going through the subreddit and thought I'd specifically bring up the titans' energy (although I'm sure a lot of you noticed this

[In this thread on another new reader's questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1jp5d5/just_read_through_the_manga_some_questions/)

Basically

**1- Titan instincts - We see this in the behavior of regular titans and Eren early on (boulder-placing scene)**

* Note on Eren: He may have had his issues because he didn't know how to control his titan(s) yet whereas the rest of the shifters (Annie, Ymir) seem to have control since they come from some village of shifters [citation needed]

**2- Human instincts - This is seen in the shifters. All of the shifters (and eventually Eren) are able to control their titans while retaining their human intellect and focus. They don't have inane desires to eat humans while in this mode.**


[Here](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/46/16)

2 things:

1. There is a clear distinction between titans. There is 1 type that can move at night and another that cannot and Reiner clearly knows that distinction (He knows what's different about the titans attacking the castle at night and the titans that invaded the walls in the beginning of the manga).

2. Ymir also knows (or SHOULD) this distinction.

And here is where I bring up my contention that was brought up in the post I linked above:

 * As long as you have enough energy to maintain your titan form

 * If you run completely out of energy

We have a problem though: What about Ymir? Ymir spent 60 years as a titan. (Before we go further, she transformed into a titan and for some reason did not turn back. She spent 60 years as a titan and finally turned back into a human while not aging a day).

What defines a normal titan? Eating humans. Remember that during training, and can go indefinitely on sun energy.

Here's what I think this means for the titans: They can survive virtually forever as long as they get sunlight (they will go dormant in prolonged absence such as the titans in the wall). Eating humans for the sake of killing them is too mindless so I think we can rule this out. Titans eat humans because they're instincts tell them to. Their instincts tell them to eat humans because there's some way they can regain human form (or regain ability to regain human form) by eating certain humans. Since we only know of 2 humans (regular humans and shifting humans)

I'm also going to assume Monkey Trouble has some knowledge on this such as alternate ways of transforming INTO and OUT OF titan form.


**tl;dr Titans eat humans because they are looking for specific humans (shifters) in order to transform back into their human form and they're doing this out of pure


* Alternate theory: ""Yeah, the idea that it's energy-based.
I did also read a theory that instead of being energy-based, Eren was COVERED in flesh binding him to his titan and it was close to covering his whole face. Other times we see the human in the titan, it doesn't look nearly as covering as it did then.
Basically, you BECOME the titan and give in to titan instinct.""",Manga Spoilers,True,nsfw,t5_2we2n,1376019909.0,crab38,

Hello all! I recently fell *totally* and *completely* in love with SnK, ha ha. Since I've wasted so much time on them already, I figured I might as well share them. I apologize if other people came up with these theories already. In my defense, I couldn't find any similar theories after googling really quick.

But before I start talking about Reiner, I'd like to share [this pixiv user's observation](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=36168936) that all the languages in this world is, in fact, [upside-down Japanese katakana](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga_big&amp;illust_id=36168936&amp;page=20). The [comic covers all have those texts as well](http://shingeki-kyojin.com/archives/26439768.html) (thank you 2ch), and they say the following (my translation, will focus on readable English rather than accurate, direct translation - keep in mind that the Japanese language often leaves out subjects and has no forms for plurals

&gt;「巨人の圧倒的な戦力に成す術もなく、人類は新天地への航海を余儀なくされた。このとき人類のほとんどが死滅したが、その大半は人同士の手によるのでした。」

&gt;「この壁の中に永久に争いのない世界を創ろう。」

&gt;Humanity's ideals are within these walls.

&gt;Let us build a world forever without war within these walls.

Some people on 2ch pointed out that this might be what the Wall religion teaches and therefore the information not necessarily accurate; however, I believe that there are three main groups of people/beings at play:

* Humanity inside the walls

* Humanity outside the walls

* Titans

What does all this have to do with Reiner

Why?

Note how Bertholdt and Annie talks about the trainee soldiers. They view most of the trainees as those who only look out for their own safety and who has no interest in fighting the titans.

Bertholdt (Chapter 13):

&gt;君達は彼らとは違うだろ？巨人の恐怖を知らずにここにいる人達だ。彼らがここにいる大半の理由は世間的な体裁を守るため…12歳を迎えて生産者に回る奴は臆した腰抜けだって…ウォール・マリア陥落以降反転した世論に流されて訓練兵になった。かといって調査兵団になるつもりもなく憲兵団を目指しつつ駄目だったら駐屯兵を選んで憲兵団への異動を伺う…

&gt;You [Eren and Armin] are different from those other guys, and eventually ask to be transferred to the Police Force...

Annie (Chapter 14):

&gt;なぜかこの世界では巨人に対抗する力を高めた者ほど巨人から離れられる。どうしてこんな茶番になると思う？それが人の本質だからでは？

&gt;For some reason

For some reason, lazy bums who abandoned the rest of humanity for their own benefit - this is assuming that the story told on the cover is correct, of course. This would nicely explain Reiner's possible motives for destroying the wall as well, and why he apparently changed his mind.

Perhaps the term 'warrior' was actually a term used by humanity outside the walls to describe *their* soldiers, from [the clothing they were wearing](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/40/44). If they were training to control their titan powers, they should turn into a titan to fight the Ymir-like titan. They did not. **This implies that they were humans at that point.**

Maybe this is what the kingdom wants to hide from the public - that they know there are more human beings outside the wall

How did the trio become titans? My guess is that the people within the trio's village were probably turned into titans, if the trio would break down the Walls. This would explain what Ymir meant when she said that Bertholdt and Reiner would be able to go back home if they go to the Ape Titan.

This would also explain why Bertholdt and Annie claim that they are acting for their own safety first and foremost.

Annie (Chapter 21):

&gt;私はただ、自分が助かりたいだけよ。

&gt;I just want to save myself.

(Chapter 31):

&gt;きっと、か弱い乙女の気持ちなんて、わからないだろうさ。

&gt;You probably wouldn't understand how a weak little girl feels.

Bertholdt (Chapter 13):

&gt;僕には…自分の意志がない。羨ましいよ…自分の命より大事なものがあって…

&gt;I... don't have my own will. I'm jealous that you have something more important than **your own life**...

If Annie

But there might be more reasons for Bertholdt's comment. Remember that Reiner can't seem to read Ymir's language; remember that *someone* was recently living within Castle Utgard; that the Ape Titan asked Mike if the titan was speaking Mike's language. The Ape Titan apparently speaks a language that's not spoken within the walls

I think that the Ape Titan and Ymir belong to the third group - the titans who rule the world. This would explain why Reiner agreed that Ymir would die if she went along with Reiner and Bertholdt, she is an escapee from the titan world. She says that, like Christa/Historia, she ""was hated just for being born."" The titans probably are interested in killing her, for whatever reason. This would explain why her reason for not being able to trust Reiner and Bertholdt was apparently because ""they don't trust her"" - because Ymir belongs to the group that probably took away Bertholdt and Reiner's home.

And there is something Ymir and the Ape Titan have in common - they have *elf ears*, and Annie's titan forms, who have *human ears*. Who else has elf ears in his titan form?

Eren.

This, like Ymir, decided to get a new life as a human being within the walls. Maybe that's what's in the basement of Eren's home - goods, especially books, that his ancestors brought. Maybe this is why Grisha hid the basement - to hide their titan ancestry. Maybe Grisha truly did just give the shot for making Eren lose his memory, not for turning him into a giant. Maybe this is another reason why Reiner, Bertholdt, *before* he saw Eren in his titan form.

While the reveal was incredibly surprising, not in a bad way. The colossal titan has always been the symbol for this series and with such a seemingly normal identity, I wonder if he will *remain* the mascot for AoT.

But what really sparked my doubts about the colossal titan remaining as THE titan was the introduction of the new intelligent deviant

I feel as though with the Colossal and Armored titans being revealed

Another interesting thing is that the Orangatitan didn't know that humans could talk. If there really was a human in its nape, the only intelligent titans have been ones with humans inside them.

* Some humans can transform into titans at will. They also have more control over the form than normal titans

* Several groups living within the walls know (at least partially) the truth about titans. Some or all of the groups have the ability to transform into titans themselves. This contributes to the previous idea that the whole titan plague was caused by humanity. It certainly contradicts the narrative of titans randomly appearing and almost driving humans to extinction. Eren's dad either was a part of one of these groups or acquired this knowledge independently. His disappearance also seems deliberate

* Several of those who can transform into titans belong to some kind of group that has the goal of knocking down all the walls and presumably destroying all of humanity. It has been implied that this goal is a means to a greater end. Those responsible are humans who have some sort of special knowledge that they believe makes their actions reasonable. Their desire to kidnap Eden could mean that (1) They need more people with the titan shaping ability and (2) They don't have the ability to bestow this ability

* The timing of these wall destroying attacks must be significant, so it's possible that they were fearful of the religious group and the titans within the innermost wall.

* The latest ""breach"" was likely the transformation of normal humans inside the wall into titans by the Monkey Titan

My theory (I hope it's right) is that titans were some sort of scientific advancement by a group in a modern society for a higher goal. It's possible that every single thing that has happened so far has been roughly according to their plan. Based on what I've read

* The religious group seems to want to reinforce the walls
* The soldiers want to break down all of the walls
* The monkey titan's goals are unknown. He seemed to be intensely curious about humanity's advancements in fighting off titans

**What is a Subreddit Snoo?**

- A subreddit snoo is basically the reddit alien customized to fit our subreddit.

The one we have right now is fine and all but we need something that has some traits of the reddit alien. (We will also retire the one we have right now and make him into a flair.)

==

If you're one of those talented people that follows the series and likes this subreddit

- Draw your personal version on what you think the subreddit snoo should be.

- Make a full scaled one and a 135x135 one.

- Keep it SFW

- Send it to me as a PM here in Reddit. Make sure the title of the PM is ""Snoo Submission"" or something like it.

- **That's it!**

==

**Deadline:** Thursday

==

- The winner will be chosen by everyone here in the subreddit. A thread will be made once the voting begins.

Also, general discussion thread!",L3gionHD,28,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1eipmk/will_this_anime_become_one_of_the_big_three_also/, and I'm only 6 episodes (45 chapters) in. The pacing is brilliant, brilliant art style and voice acting aaaaaaaand.. Well

So what would the prerequisites be for it to become a ""big three"" anime? Well, I'd have to assume that it will be fairly long. There are copious amounts of unsolved mysteries at the moment. [What's in the basement? What are the Titan's motives? What's the plan of Bert and Reiner? What about that big hairy Titan? And that religion? And the royalty! And the Titans in the walls!? Seriously, so much to think about.](#spoiler) Seeing as there's so many plot twists and eventualities to think about, I'd say, and maybe I'm being optimistic here, but I think we're looking at a 200 episode anime at least. 

It has to sell well. And since the release of the anime, and things appear to only be able to go up from here, which is a good sign. And seeing as how the quality of the manga hasn't dipped at all yet, I'd assume that the same would apply to the anime. The one thing I dread is filler. *Shudders*

Also, including myself, watch anime. The others wouldn't be particularly interested in it. **However**, I strongly urged everyone in my group to watch it, and thus far 10 of them have. And guess what? All 10 of them started the first episode, and after watching it, were so drawn in that they watched the other 5 immediately after. They're all so amazed by it, frankly. It's just so good.

[Eren was the last person to see his dad](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/6241/shingeki-no-kyojin_v1_ch3_by_gantz-waitingroom/22), and that she doesnt remember who she ate (or remember much of it all) -- the ""memory"" loss of the injection refers to the memory loss that would accompany being a titan (before learning to control it). 

A side note to that

I think it's very unclear whether eating a number of people has to do with regaining humanity or not. 

2) I want to humor the time loop theory. Chapter 47 speaks of Eren ""possibly"" being the coordinate

The biggest reason I want to humor the time loop theory is that it explains the motivations of BRA very very clearly. They don't care about wiping out humanity, which is seen). They break the walls down every five years, to give humanity time to adjust to try and sniff out the coordinate. They were ""wiping out humanity"" for the purposes of getting the coordinate out so they could use the time machine (or whatever) with the ""coordinate"" to try and create a future that's different from how the government/cult is using (which is likely trying to extent the stay in the walls as long as possible), versus trying to create a better future where humanity take more risks. I feel like this would symbolically fit very well with the series. 

The wall cult being part of it would make Christa also important as Chapter 47 would state.

I think this also makes Eren and the cult leader much more interesting -- ""residual"" emotions from previous time loops are affecting them

First off

As you're reading this

No

Anyways

=

Added: Header made by /u/FlyingGoatee

Added: Title logo edited out by me. :3

~~Added: Header made by /u/Irf00~~

~~Added: plain background with logo. thoughts?~~

~~**Header**~~ removed by request

~~This was the header that I used before the last one. It's just a simple screen grab from the anime intro with some filter added in. It is more simple and easy to the eye than the other one and it kinda works well with the overall theme of the subreddit.~~

=

**Chibi Titan**

All credit goes to /u/Irf00 for helping me find it and fixing it up. I don't believe it's an original work by his but I only plan on using it temporarily as I will be hosting a **drawing contest** very soon to see if any one of you has actual talents to draw a reddit alien fit for us. 

=

**Updated Flairs**

I added changes to some of the flairs available. Before

As for the emblems of the three walls (Maria, I kept the ones in the manga in place. The reason being is that the ones that are shown in the anime all seem too similar to each other and would be impossible to tell each one apart in such small dimensions.

Some people did request if it's possible to make the flairs smaller. I did try and see if it would work but unfortunately, I believe the flairs look better aligned with everything else even if it's still the same size.

=

**Updated Sidebar**

Along with the new theme is a new sidebar. Highlight one of the options and more options will be revealed like the newest episodes or chapters, etc.

The sidebar also shows the **New Spoiler system**. It's a little bit more neat looking and easy to use but don't worry

=

**Rules**

So now that the subreddit is much bigger than it was 3 nights ago

*Rule #1* **Do Not Post Spoilers in the Title!**

e.g. 

-
Bad - ""OMG I'm so mad that Voldermort killed Optimus Prime! Anyone else?""

Good - ""HarrFormers Episode 99 Discussion""

-

Bad - ""[Spoiler] So after Goku finally learned to fly the Wing Gundam

Good - ""[Spoler] Question about the ending of chapter 22. Sort of confused.""

-

*Rule #2* Please moderate yourself and your comments

Unfortunately

If you are reading the manga

Some spoilers that pains me to see [Saying Ymir's name, etc.](#spoiler ""Heavy Manga"").

*Rule #3* Don't be a Dick

=

Well

**Please

Thanks for reading! Again

Hades-Greek god of the Underworld

Zeus-King of the Greek God

Demeter-Greek Goddess of the Harvest

Persephone-Daughter of Demeter

Does anyone else think that the pomegranate scene is a symbolic throwback to greek mythology? Since in greek mythology Persephone or Demeter's daughter was tricked by Hades into staying since she ate of the Pomegranate. It was a rule that anyone that ate food or drink in hades realm had to stay there which is why she has to go back down according to myth.

However since Zeus couldn't let her stay in the Underworld permanently because Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow he made Hades share her. Which is why for some months out of the years the crops don't grow. In some versions it explains the number of months by the number of seeds that she eats so anywhere from 3-7 seeds.

This is why the ancient greeks thought the seasons to be the way they are because Demeter became depressed while Persephone was gone to Hades and nothing grew.

In relation to attack on Titan. We see her questioning why she goes on.

Then the Pomegranate shines in the light and the other Titan shows up. She remembers Eren's words and fights resolving to never give up again no matter what.

The first page isn't that important, I actually thought they were IN the basement, I had no idea they were in the forest somewhere. I have no idea where this is, but I'm assuming it's in some forest within the wall near their village but a distance away.

In the third panel, you will experience losses of memory."" Go back a few pages to the part where he's being initially questioned about whether he's a human or titan.

Eren says



**I think I hit an image limit



What I actually want to address with all of this is what exactly that injection did. MOST people agree that the injection gave Eren his titan powers. I think there's two possibilities here: 

1. The injection gave Eren titan powers
2. The injection ""unlocked"" and already inherent property of humans which allowed use of the titan powers (Basically

I don't think we have the resources to know this yet and I'm not sure of the answer myself (Although I'm leaning towards #2 since Monkey Trouble turned that one village into titans supposedly in the breach arc recently)

However

First

1. He was taken to the woods to get the injection. Why would he need to leave the village entirely to give an injection that enables titan powers? How about if it would turn him into a titan initially on the spot (or at least has the chance)?

2. Memory loss. In the scan where he's being questioned, hence why I think he DID turn into a titan at the spot.

There's also something else I want to address that I just thought of: The basement. No one really knows what's in the basement right now, but I don't think it's anything that's going to save humanity on its own. What does Eren's father accomplish by telling Eren that no matter what, he has to get to the basement by taking back Wall Maria? It gives him a goal and purpose. Since he's the one injection Eren with something that will allow titan powers, surely he knows enough about how shifters work and that he needs a purpose to ""activate"" the powers. The basement might not have something as important as we've been led to believe, but just think about what he has to do to complete the ""purpose"" he was given. He has to get rid of all the titans within Wall Maria and seal it off, essentially restoring the civilization to where it started, resetting the board to where things were before the attack. He's basically getting Eren's foot in the door mentally and preparing him for what he needs to do.

Next up, some say he's in BRA's village, some say he's dead.

I'm not positive on my position

1. He's in BRA's village.

2. He's dead.

As for why he'd be in BRA's village: If he has an injection to make people shifters, it's going to be outside the wall.

As for why he could be dead: In this case

Regardless

First of all we see a war between humans on the picture

Secondly, Berthold AND the friend that Ymir ate, since they were the only Shifters known at that time. But somehow they need more of them to be stronger, so they searched for Ymir inside the Walls 5 years ago (Shiaganshina incident) to have someone eat her to get another obedient Shifter (Ymir probably won't help them willingly). So they used Shifters for the first time. And after A&amp;R&amp;B found Eren, they abandoned the plan for Ymir, since Eren would have been enough. But they still found her and took her with them. Ymir realized the defeat of the Walls and decided to let Historia live with the other faction. 

Now I think that the quote from Ymir ""There is no future inside the Walls"" doesn't mean the extinction of the human race but rather the presumed victory for the people outside the Walls,True,nsfw,t5_2we2n,False,g,crow26,t3_1k67jm

If you don't want to click I'll quote the important part (and I don't know about you but these don't sound boring to me at all


&gt;There are plot blurbs available on Amazon.co.jp

&gt;The first novel is about a Scouting Legion member named Angel (SUBTLE!!!!!!!) who is determined to find the titans’ weakness and develop “revolutionary anti-Titan weaponry.”  The manga DID mention that it took a damn long time for humanity to figure out that slicing the back of the neck is the only way to destroy a titan

&gt;Okay, I’m totally fucking serious, this is what the plot descriptions on shingeki.net and amazon.co.jp actually say - is discovered as a newly-born infant inside a pile of titan excrement after his pregnant mother is swallowed and shat out by a titan.  And of course he ends up joining the Scouting Legion because why not.


Haven't we read in the manga (I did say manga spoilers

/edit: just read a bit more and it looks like the kid was found inside the remains of a titan

**Hey SnK fans, and I thought I would adopt that idea and try it here, every week I'll post a few questions to get people excited for the anime (and in the future maybe the manga) until it ends, brainstorming very encouraged!**
&gt;Please don't spoil episodes with the manga as references.



* What would you do of you were in Erens position to save man kind?


* What is your opinion on Dot Pixis so far? 


* If you were just a regular soldier in this situation how would you react from the recent battle


* Who is your favorite character at this point? (Pssst.. It's Mikasa.)


* What did you think about the animation this episode? 

* If you're not familiar with the manga; what do you think will happen next?


Hope you guys enjoyed this weeks episode of Shingeki No Kyojin! If liked this idea
Let me know what you think
See you all next week!

Do you think Mikasa loves Eren,False,self,t5_2we2n,False,,crab24,t3_1g64x7
1370744670.0,1fyl0s,Some theories about the Wall (Manga Spoilers),seollasido,17,4,26,"EDIT: Whoops. I forgot the name was a spoiler. I remade the thread :(

So I've been reading through the past chapters, most of what I've collected is quite scattered, but I at least managed to put together some sort of theory centralized around Ymir. I mostly want to share it to see if people can help me fill in the gaps that's present in this theory that I haven't been quite been able to piece together. 

Alright

**1) Some notes on ""Titan tranformation technology""**

I think we can largely divide them into two types -- ones that are operational at night

It's also fairly clear at this point, for whatever reason.

Side Note: I think this is why Eren's kind of a key figure -- his Titan transformation tech is likely different from the others

**2) The wall existed before the humanity needed to flee to them.**

First, b) there's no way for fleeing humans to be able to construct such a wall -- after all, they were fleeing from Titans.

I do recognize that there is a possibility that the fleeing humans could have had titan tranformation technology and put together a wall the very last minute. But I do think it's more likely that...

**3) The wall was constructed by Ymir's people**

There are castles within the walls, but what confirms this connection between the castle and Ymir is that she is able to [read the can](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/135631/shingeki-no-kyojin_v9_ch38_by_tdx/31) that was written in a language that Reiner wasn't able to understand. Furthermore, the castles existed before the walls -- after all, the humanity that moved into the walls had no reasons to construct castles (especially within Wall Rose out of all places).

But the evidence I'm most intrigued by, we do know Ymir is at least connected with a group of Titans, as evidenced by the [side chapter](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/89453/shingeki-no-kyojin_v5_ch18.5_by_gantz-waitingroom).

Christa/Historia is also a big important piece -- after all

Finally, implying I think that Ymir is much older than she is....

Side note: The manga also points out that [someone was using the castle before the scouting legion arrives there](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/135631/shingeki-no-kyojin_v9_ch38_by_tdx/22). That is worth noting

**4) Ymir's origin**

Chapter 40 is one of the most informative chapters in the manga with regards to this. The first most important part is [Ymir and Christa's conversation.](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/145464/shingeki-no-kyojin_v10_ch40_by_tdx/25). The important bit is that Ymir tells Christa that they are alike

This is culminated with [her monologue](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/145464/shingeki-no-kyojin_v10_ch40_by_tdx/38). The most important lines being: ""[I was hated for the simple fact of my existence in this world... and I... Died... ...For the happiness of a great many people.](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/145464/shingeki-no-kyojin_v10_ch40_by_tdx/39)""

Ymir ""died"". Her existence likely refers to her Titan form -- which would mean that her titan form was used for something -- a guess of mine would be crystalization, 2) But Titans (or people who got turned into Titans) worshipped specifically Ymir. Perhaps this is in reference to ""her death"" that led to ""happiness of a great many people"", and the people who turned into Titans after recognize this. 

The reason why I speculate crystalization is that someone on her race not recognizing who Ymir was (if she made such a big impact, and why she was feared and hated by her people). The question would be, ""why was she crystalized""?


Another thing here is to think about when and where Reiner and Berthold being attacked by Ymir would take place, it would have been a bigger deal and it's more likely Berthold/Reiner are from the outside), meaning Berthold and Reiner are from outside of the wall (and by that logic, also Annie).

Another thing to note is that [the church only appeared five years ago](http://www.batoto.net/read/_/89454/shingeki-no-kyojin_v5_ch19_by_gantz-waitingroom/19). They existed beforehand, but that would also help us place Ymir's ""second chance at life"" somewhere in the timeline, because it's likely she was looking for information, not ""money"".

**5) Wild Guesses**

People have been speculating that there's some war between Titans that are going on. I think this is becoming more and more evident, confirms that there are at least 3 factions -- the beast titan, reiner/berthold/annie, and ymir. Christa and Eren are both very important chess pieces. 

**Final Notes**

Please note that these are just deductions (some wilder than others) and I've connected a lot of dots. As with any connect the dots go -- there's a very good chance I may have connected the dots in a weird way. This is one of the reasons I've written this post, will be useful in having fun with future chapters. 

Another note is that I'm fairly convinced that the series is very metaphorical, could be a very useful tool in putting more pieces together. Of course we would have to deduce some parts about what the author is trying to say (he's said quite a bit though already!), but that's another angle that I haven't really looked at yet.

Finally, but those can be anything since we only have so much. But I hope the background information helps others come up with more interesting theories!

Trost Arc - To make things simple we'll say this started on episode one and ended with Eren closing the gate of Trost in his titan form.

Female Titan Arc - This arc started off with Eren detained and about to go to court. It ended with the climactic battle between eren and the female titan along with the revelation that Wall Rose has been breached.

Breach Arc - This began with the 104 trainees squad and some scouting legion members making quick decisions to deal with the 'breach' of wall rose. It ended with the grand battle between Eren and the armored titan along with the capture of Eren and Ymir. (The next arc after this is the Pursuers Arc and is not completed yet thus wont be part of this discussion).

(Warning: This article contains heavy SPOILERS, feel free to check out our upcoming general series review.)


As with most shonen action series (especially very good ones), largely due to the enthralling action scenes that tend to distract us so well.


‘Attack on Titan’ (Shingeki no Kyojin) embodies this phenomenon, a few google searches reveal that the growing fan base has had little to no discussion regarding the Titans’ origins: something this article hopes to remedy.


In order to begin our analysis


The world of ‘Attack on Titan’ seems to operate within the realm of reality (albeit, and all three of its military divisions, rely solely on science. Aside from the mystery that surrounds the Titans themselves, every other aspect of the world has some sort of believable or scientific background that can be explained. Regardless as to whether or not the 3DM gear the Legion uses to combat the titans, or the walls surrounding mankind can actually exist, we, as readers and viewers, a wizard or a higher power. In fact


Therefore, the characteristics of the Titan that we do know about may spell out some jarring conclusions. For the sake of discussion, I’m going to lay out one of these theories, and my reasons afterwards:


The Titans are a human creation used to unify the human race in order to prevent its self-induced extinction. 


Now there’s a lot of possible evidence


1st: The Titans came into existence 100 years ago. Assuming a ‘god’ or magical power didn’t create the Titans


2nd: The anatomy of the Titans doesn’t follow the organic rules of nature. Titans can regenerate their limbs and have no reproductive organs. Perhaps this could be used as evidence against the theory I’m laying out


3rd: The Titans have a singular purpose. They seem to only exist in order to kill humans through ingesting them. However, implying that their desire to hunt isn’t for mere survival purposes. This is further evidenced by the fact that they don’t need food to survive, and don’t choose to attack any other living creatures. 


4th: Before the beginning of the story, humanity was in a time of peace and order, largely due to the protective measures taken to fight the Titans, and the Titans’ role as a unifying enemy that lead to universal trust in the government. Indeed, when Eren’s transformative powers are revealed in non-government newspapers in later chapters, citizens are heard saying claiming the story to be false, largely to the lack of government endorsement. Furthermore, the people of inner walls seem to have never been exposed to hardship


5th: The author characterizes governments as immoral and even genocidal. The campaign to recapture the Wall Maria left hundreds of thousands dead


6th: In the most recent chapters of the manga, Connie even claims that the fetal-like Titan laying on his house seems to resemble his mother in appearance—an eerily foreboding statement given that his entire village seems to have disappeared. This whole development implies that the Titans may be capable of forming through the mass death of human individualism. Though the ways in which this happen are impossible to speculate at this point, it is indeed possible that we can assume there is a scientific reason for this phenomenon.

The technology in the Shingeki No Kyojin world seems very ahead of it's time. The 3d maneuver gear especially. We could always just say ""oh well for plot purposes they have this advanced gear."" I honestly don't buy that answer. But I'm going to come back to this.

Now lets talk about someone I'll call monkey titan, i.e the best form any titan could hope to achieve.[This](http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/35/38) is why I think he is not a ""true"" titan. He says in the nape of **our** necks. As in, he is identifying himself with the other titans. 

Another note on him identifying with the language. I don't think it's because he is a different species or he is an alien or anything. I think it's because when he was human

Some may say ""well what about [this panel](http://www.mangapanda.com/shingeki-no-kyojin/35/43) when he calls the humans 'they'"" I don't think he is referring to ""them"" as  humans

My prediction regarding eren and the massacring of the humans is that there is something about the humans inside the wall that makes *them* the bad guys. I believe this ties in with the ""disease"" that eren's dad saved everybody from. Perhaps the 3 walls were built not to save humans from the titans, and they basically told him the theory I have above. That he had to do it for some greater good. 

What I can't figure out is why there are some titans who are stupid, and some like Berterolt and the wall titans. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this. Every time I a new episode comes out I get more ideas like these because it is clearer than the manga. If people like this I'll try to make it a regular thing :)

**TL;DR** Titans could be good guys humans inside the walls bad guys.

**edit**: [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1f2jxr/never_forget/ca6l7gq) gave me an idea. I think that would make sense. But it isn't just anybody who died

**edit2**: I never came back to the technology. I honestly have no idea how to explain this. The year is only 850 A.D

1369208427.0,1etm5r,Theory on what Titans are [Spoilers],jumphighlandnowhere,13,3,13,"Why the titans are doing such things

So

They give off heavy vapors that are hot at some points

Disintegrate quickly

Regenerate quickly

The fact they are called Titans

They consume humans to kill them rather than just smacking them around (but it seems that some of them do kill them that way. The main way they do it is consumption though)

They biologically do not need to consume humans

They ignore animals (unless animals are helping humans escape them)

They can talk, which aren't like the others, the Ape Titan was rather intelligent and interested in the 3D Maneuver gear. He also could talk.

Some humans can create a titan body at will. Notice how its not ""transforming"". They do not transform

Not all humans can become titans. This is a big guess because when titan shifters are hurt


Greek Mythology Time!
The Titan Cronos would consume his newborn children due to a prophecy proclaiming that one of them would overthrow him. One did manage to escape his wrath, but close).

Why do Titans eat people?
They obviously do not need to eat people. Its most likely that they are being forced to kill people this way

Reiner and Bertholdt said their goal was the destroy mankind, a lot of the titans started aiming for him, which is a bit suspicious. Why all of a sudden aim for him? Also, Reiner and Bertholdt asked Eren to come with them after revealing their secret, and if he did come with them, they wouldn't have to destroy the walls. So, this means that they really are targeting him specifically, I don't know. There must be some other enemy outside or inside of the walls that is trying to get rid of titan shifters like Eren.

That raises the question about Reiner, and Annie. Aren't they shifters as well? Perhaps they are a different kind. I mean, they already knew they were Titans. They all had their reasons: Reiner and Berth wanted to go back to their village (which might actually be outside of the walls. If they really wanted to go back, they wouldn't have destroyed it in the first place by breaking the walls -_-), Annie's father, Ymir (no idea yet) but she apparently had something bad to do with Reiner and Berth (Will now refer to them as R_B). Going back a bit, Eren had a dream where his dad injected him with something and gave him a key and disappeared. Perhaps Eren is that of the prophecy.

Also, they do it again. Eren is revealed to be able to create a Titan Body, as some others are revealed to be. R_B say there is no more need to break walls and kidnap Eren.

So I believe the Titan's motive for eating people is this: To kill any ""human"" that may potentially be one of the new Titan Shifters or the second generation, is all humans.

In Mythology

So a question floating around is this: Is R_B/Annie/Ymir good guys or bad guys? Maybe its a combination of both. What will R_B do to Ymir and Eren? If their job (according to theory) is to kill Eren, perhaps due to his power.

Ah

According to the other story, but Zeus went to Tartarus and freed the cyclops and the Hecatoncheires (Titans with many heads and arms, I think about fifty to hundred each) and won.

If Eren is supposedly ""Zeus""

Again

A side note:
What exactly are Titans? How do they form? They may have something to do with Gypsum

Gypsum is an evaporative mineral that is used in making sculptures. It sets and hardens quickly

&gt;There are three possible endpoints: Chapter 30 (scouting legion comes home defeated)

&gt;Nonetheless, they felt that the pacing from episodes 1-8 was amazing, but they felt as though 9-13 was very slow paced. In a sense, they're right. The first 8 episodes covered nearly 13 chapters. By contrast, episodes 9-13 covered a little over five chapters. So basically, the first 8 episodes were paced at about 1.5 chapters per episode while 9-13 (and also 14-16, but that's a different case per say) were paced at 1-1. With all that said, the 1.5 pacing and the 1-1 pacing. In order to get back to the awesomeness of the first 8 episodes (not saying the episodes after that were bad, it's definitely possible for these last nine episodes to cover 13 chapters...they've done it before like I explained.**

&gt;Without further ado

&gt;Episode 17 - Explanation on the Formation of Enemy Detection. Introduction of the Female Titan (FT) including the close call with Reiner. (Other half of Chapter 22 and all of Chapter 23)

&gt;Episode 23 - FT is revealed to be Annie. Ends with Eren uppercutting Annie in titan form. (Chapter 31 and parts of 32)

&gt;Episode 24 - Eren v. Annie. Ends with the defeat of Annie and the revelation of the Walls. (Parts of chapter 32 and chapter 33)

1374763939.0,1j137w,Anyone feels the pacing of the story is really fast? [SPOILER],moumouren,13,3,28,"I just finished reading all of the chapters of the manga in one night (haha) after discovering this amazing series, there was so much good material that the pace of the story moved faster than the medium can deliver in a comfortably paced manner.

Let my illustrate. At first we get a sleepy village which is protected by giant walls from large hostile creatures called Titans. The wall gets breached, discovers superpowers yada-yada normal drama. He becomes the center of attention of the powers-that-be (episode 14), and I start to get excited for the series because it's starting to show some real plot development, from being merely humans vs monsters to the internal political struggle between humans. So things proceed as expected, hero needs to prove himself, goes out to fight monsters, FINDS INTELLIGENT FEMALE TITAN! WOW! AMAZING! Things go south, hangs head in shame.

At this point, Annie is revealed to be the *female type titan*. I mean, there was basically no setup for this at all. Barely 5 chapters ago we just realised that it was even possible for a human to be inside a Titan; the humans basically had never even come close to understanding a thing about the titans before, and all of a sudden the most badass enemy by far is actually one of the main characters, *inside freaking Wall Shina*? If I remember my thoughts when I was reading at this point, Wall Shina was supposed to be the final safe haven for all of humanity, the last line of defense. From the way the story was set up from the beginning, and that just seemed to have been ignored. There just seemed to be so much wasted potential with it

Ok, utterly without any explanation at all, we find out that the WHOLE ENTIRE WALL is revealed to be lined up with  titans. I mean, we had just realised that it was possible for a human to turn into a Titan not too long ago, and NOW we're seeing the WHOLE WALL is filled with titans. I'm not saying there wasn't a logical way to lead up to this, but don't you think that it's freaking fast to reveal something of this magnitude so abruptly? I'd expected something like this to be revealed at some point when and if Wall Shina was on the verge of collapse, or the humans were facing an inevitable civil war, in terms of its defensability against the titans. This just came out of nowhere and slapped you in the face.

Ok, implying that it's just a matter of time until Wall Shina will be breached (I expected this part to be at least 2/3 way down the entire storyline by this point). New gorilla titan appears, Wall Rose is in fact not breached, Ymir is a titan. All cool. Then all of a sudden, the epicenter of the whole story, the entire reason for the whole series, the COLOSSAL TITAN AND ARMOURED TITAN IS REVEALED! HOOO SHIT! And guess what? THEY WERE REINER AND BERTHOLDT THE ENTIRE TIME! WHHHAAAATTTTT??? Aren't they supposed to be, the final bosses or something? Plus the way they revealed themselves was so meh. Like

So I guess my question is, there would have been at least double the content's worth of material in between each of these ""arcs"" (I'm using the term loosely). I'm not saying the story is not masterfully done, it certainly keeps exceeding my expectations over and over; I'm just saying there seems to be so much wasted potential in between these points. Sorta like the opposite of filler. We could have had the epic internal struggle between the rich and the poor. We could have had the dawning horrifying realization that there were in fact titans among us. We could have seen a build up towards the indestructible Wall Shina being finally seen as mortal, and then as the enemy. There just seems to be so much wasted opportunity which can never be clawed back. I mean, on hindsight sure it may seem like that's just the way things went. But when you're reading it in foresight, don't you think that the pacing is rather fast? Would be glad to hear your thoughts.",Manga Spoilers,nsfw,,

IF YOU ARE NOT UP TO DATE IN THE MANGA SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN STOP READING. DO NOT READ IF YOU ONLY WATCH THE ANIME VERSION TITLED ATTACK ON TITAN


As you know (if you are up to date in Shingeki no Kyojin) in chapter 34
My theory on why the walls are built around titans is as followed
I believe that humanity has had the ability to turn humans into titans long before the enemy titans even existed. The humans created the technology to turn humans into titans to create the walls to defend from another opposed force at the time (another tribe or group of humans). The preferred size was the colossal size (40-50 meters) and the imperfect
I believe that when the walls were completed the smaller titans were exiled and left outside of the walls along side the other humans and after all the time the outside humans developed a bond along side the exiled titans and the outer humans developed the technology to create the same human-titan hybrids and are now seeking revenge on the humans within the walls. I think the serum or whatever it takes to create on of these titan hybrids is injected into the neck and that results in the weak spot.

&gt; The ship will be there soon.  I'll be on my way now.

This was in the first chapter, and these became useful very quickly during the evacuation.  Ostensibly, he could have been saying that he'll take a ship into the inner walls, like into Trost, or further.  Or he could have been traveling a shorter distance in Shiganshina, although this is unlikely since there's only one river and horse travel should be more direct.

The alternative speculation.... is that he's going *the other way*

Recall [the discovery](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1gdc48/my_theory_about_the_titans_spoilers/) of hidden upside down Japanese text that told of the origins of the wall.  That is, or at least they're both getting orders from the same people.  It would also follow that the plague he cured was related to his dealings with these people.

I find the current evidence to be pretty weak, the name of the Wall Shina could possibly [refer to China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shina_%28word%29).  In Japanese ""Shina"" is derogatory, but it's also just a root sound for Chinese things, also used in English as Sino, as in Sino-US relationships.  Maybe this is a signal saying ""this is in China"".  After all, the people living within the walled areas *came from another continent*, and we know that Asians are basically extinct

* Colossal Titan is obviously another Titan-changing human

* There is a possibility that Armoured Titan is a human as well (plot device: he got a name), knowing how it is an anime, we've seen all of their ""secret identities"" already (but this would be downright retareded and I still have hope that AoT is something more than that, a man can dream)

So we can all pretty much agree titans originate from people being injected by this ""serem"" of some sort to make them strong and regenerate

Some evidence/points that i build my theory off:

* Much is unknown of outside world (like everything)
* Orangutitan is intelligent
* Orangutitan has different appearance and intelligence than normal dumb titans (who i'll call ""normies"")
* Bertholt
Reiner and Bertholt from same place, Bertholt: ""To join royal guard ""(elminate royalty cuz war going on?) Reiner: ""I just want to go to home that was taken from me.""
* We know the walls were built by colossals (how/why?)
* Basement contains ""Their memories that should help Eren find/control his power""
* Dr. Jaeger travelled all over
* Annie/BH/Reiner's mission was to ""eliminate everyone"" until Eren turned titan

***So here's the theory:***

* Eotans were a weapon developed by an entirely different faction
* Titan became able to create titans and multiple types of supertype Eotans as soldiers (Annie
* Titan invaded the Monarchy (which used to have tonnes of land) and instead of committing genocide
* Rather than die
* To keep the oppressed from exploring outside the walls and finding Titan/learning anything, this is their sole purpose. Also, perhaps these test subjects who don't possess the mental fortitude to overcome Eotan's impulsive instinct.
* Dr. Jaeger knows the truth
* ""Memories"" are old documents written by the people back when Titan attacked the Monarchy. Possibly containing more information about titan abilities

Now for some reason I don't know
Once this happens
Once Eren becomes a titan
With Eren now a playing card, the Orangititan discovers the 3D gear and bring's it back to Titan. 

Now the question remains as to why Annie

* They couldn't find a way to leave the wall undiscovered
* They're secretly also plotting against Titan. Since a human from the Monarchy was able to turn titan, so to say considering there are child/babylike Eotans.. 

Now this doesn't mean they can just inject the serem into everyone and they're all intelligent and willful. Even Eren became overcome by it and attacked Mikasa right? So only certain people have the mental resolve to control this abilty. 

Any thoughts? This is definitely not complete so I'd love to hear anything you guys might want to contribute.

***TL;DR:***
Monarchy got attacked by faction with ability to create Titans. Created walls for the Monarchy to live in as livestalk/test subjects.
Jaeger creates serem to make own titans and begin the resistance.

**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**



When Eren wakes up from his dream in first episode, Eren"" and out of blue, he asks her if her hair has gotten longer.](http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/1/19) This, first of many forshadowing that the author throws at us might give us some insight. My theory is that 2000 years from now, in about 2800, the world is still the same. SnK's world is inspired by the Viking mythology, as shown in many references throughout the story and names of certain characters. For instance, if you look for it in the Norse(viking) Mythology, those giants break down the wall and kill the gods...basically

Back to SnK, and extracted a virus to titan-fy things. Some plants that he experimented on create the gigantic forest outside the walls of SnK. The nation start to investigate on the Remnant of Ymir and create the Titans. The nation decide to use the Titans as a part of their conquest. ""The world without conflicts"" (On the cover of a second book, the map has upside down writing that reads that) It was simple, they build the walls to protect themselves safely inside, and spread the giants outside to devastate everyone else. They probably had some sort of vaccine that will kill Titans. From the beginning, I was wondering how the walls were conveniently built once Titans appeared. Walls were under construction by the royalties in secrecy, and when they released the Titans, for the convenience

However

In short

The plan was perfect

Those messenger titans - one that can revert back to human - create their own nation outside the walls. If needed, they were revealed to be titans in manga. 


To clarify

1. Humans and royalties who created Titans (Midgard

2. Titans without intelligence

3. Titans with Intelligence (Jötunheimr)

4. Messenger Titans who joined Jötunheimr. (Ymir)

5. Messenger Titans who created their own nation. (Reiner


Anywho, who had the vaccine. However, Eren didn't know or didn't have guts to use the vaccine. In order to do so, he will have to come forward with the vaccine and expose himself. He hid it in the lab of his father and waited till he can use the vaccine. However, in 850's, he was killed by Titans and the vaccine and the location of the lab is lost. The Ragnarok Project that began in 700s, is continuing without any way of ending it. This state of entrapment of human continues for 2000 years. And by then, the world is already theirs, anyone who gets close to the answer gets killed by the titans. Finally, so in year 2700s

At one point in history, explained the plan that humanity is going to do. They create the time machine with all the resources and scientific advances combined. The purpose of the time machine is to send assassin into 700s to kill the Eren's father before he create the Titan virus. However, for some unknownreason this fails, and the future fails to change. In year 2800, the titans attacks human one last time and humanity comes to an end.



At the year 2800s, back to the past in a hope to save him from the Titans. She sends him off with her final word ""See you later, Eren."" It is impossible even for her son, Eren's eye. This is why he cries when he wakes up. I assume that Mikasa's name was passed down to her descendents. Since she is...quite obsessive of Eren, she probably wished that the son of her lineage will be called Eren, and daughter Mikasa. However in time warp, only the memory warp back.


Due to the nature of the travel, since Mikasa's lineage is quite unique (Oriental) future Eren's mother, Mikasa, is similar enough to past Eren's Mikasa. I guess the future one had short hair, that's why he asks her about the hair when he wakes up.

Eren's father, he disrupts Eren's memory of location of his lab and what is in there (most likely vaccine)


In 850's, he writes to the future that he came from the future and back to 800s, but he failed, so that future humans should send assassin to year 700 instead to kill his father instead. This is the letter, ""To you, 2000 years later""

In future, and failed. In the brink of extinction of humanity, Mikasa send her son, Eren, back in time just to save him. The loop continues on.



Back to the Norse Mythology, the fire is not for the destroying, it is for cleansing the world. 

In SnK


TL;DR

1. The SnK's world is in Time loop without the possibility of multiverse. In the end

2. In 700s, lab is ransacked (probably by intelligent titans) and Eren is killed

3. Eren, 2000 years from now,"" before his death that soon follows. In the future, when humanity find the letter, they realize the possibility of time travel and create time machine. They send back the assassin into 700s to kill the Scientist, but fails. Titans are created. In 2800s, Mikasa sends her son, back to the past to save him from the Titans and the history repeats itself. The loop is completed,False,g

Bert and Reiner seemed to know the ape titan. Annie is afraid for her life despite being able to transform into a 15-meter tall killing machine. Bert and Reiner both seem conflicted about what they're doing. Also the line about ""Do you really think this world can last"".

 - connected Shiganshina District with titan territory
 - connected the area between wall Maria and Rose with titan territory

But that left 3 towns within Wall Maria isolated!!  They're still protected by their own walls!  Humans fled to within Wall Rose (with major causalities), you could hang out there in perfect peace.  This seems perfectly obvious if you look at a map of the walls:

http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/File:About_the_Walls_Pt2.jpg

Have these towns even been named?  They've been isolated for 5 years.  What if they could be host to isolated societies?  Couldn't you travel between them by moving along the top of the wall

Where in the manga did it give information about Reiner Braun's hometown?  I can't tell if it was stated to be one of the 4 outer towns of Wall Maria or if it was within it.  This is thought to be a lie

What if breaching the walls

After all, except that she was in *Trost*!  This would predict there are 3+4=7 more shifters we don't know about yet.

3) Speaking of Annie, but since what we know about Annie/Bertholdt/Reiner is part of their ruse...it also seemed strange because the bottom-left panel needlessly focuses on her face. I don't think Isayama does many needless things. Anybody agree or disagree?

4) Does Pixis lead the Stationary Guard? It seems like he does, or it's because Pixis' military role also involves a level of civil administration?

5) Is the beginning of Chapter 39, the titans that arose during the Ape Escape (hurr), just as they can wallow around during the night, are also ""cannibalistic"" (in terms of just attacking other titans)?

This just might explain how Ymir became human again. I'm theorizing big here...but what if the process of becoming ""human again"" (titan shifter) involves eating whole a titan shifter and then interacting with that titan shifter inside the body of the titan.

It's clear in this page I just showed that Bertholdt did a lot inside of his body. He stripped the 3DMG of the soldier and took Ymir. The only plausible way this could have occured is if he interacted with them while they were inside his body.

**Due to the nature of the world of Attack On Titan, if you die, you stay dead. The way around this is to create a new char.**

A system is forming and will be smoothed out as more people join to act as beta testers. The main parts of the RP goes as follows:

* It will be text heavy. That means you will need to be specific in your RPing so you can get the best outcome.

* Combat is more based on text and RPing than actual equipment and skills(Skills do exist though). This was done due to there being only 1 weapon to kill titans with.

* You can join whoever you want and start wherever you want. Want to be in a small hunting village? Go ahead. Want to join the police force? Go ahead. Want to be in the scouting legion? Go ahead. Of course some will not be joining right from the get go and you must train to get it in.

* You can become a human that can change into a Titan. Once you create your char you can roll for a 5% chance to become one. In this

* The World will be a spin-off from the actual one. No main chars will exist in this. And we will take artistic liberty in some of the mysteries of the series we do not know the answers to just yet.

I'm leaning toward no

Here's the parts I think just wouldn't work:

* The grappling hooks/anchors/whatever they're called.  I get that they must have some mechanism to ""latch into"" something after they pierce it (like maybe when the tether to them is pulled tight?) and another to release (cause how else could they ever get them out?)... And they're obviously very sharp

* Compressed gas tanks being able to do that much work.  Obviously the compressed gas powers the whole system, and providing thrust.  Presumably holding the line taught can be done simply by squeezing a handle or something, so let's assume they don't need gas for that.  Even then, can 2 of those tanks really hold enough gas to last anywhere near as long as shown, doing everything they do?  It seems like they'd blow their load after about 5 seconds.

* Human reflexes.  Human bodies can handle swinging at those speeds, much less actually planning ahead where to anchor themselves to swing in such a way to not shatter their skeleton.  Even simple movement with the 3DMG would require some crazy abilities to survive once, much less reliably.

Is there anything I'm missing?  Are either of the first two of these actually possible?  Particularly the anchoring?",self,t5_2we2n,1374166484.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1ikgfs/is_it_possible_to_construct_a_working_real_life/

In the pages devoted to the scouting legion there was something I found rather odd 
since when have the scouts targeted specific titans?Even if it was Eren's dream it still makes no sense because how the hell would Eren know what a titan looks like(seeing as before they attacked he had never encountered one)?But what complicates things further (in my head at least ) is the resemblance of the ch1 titan to the ape titan http://www.mangareader.net/shingeki-no-kyojin/1/13

We're gonna see titans with 3DM Gear. Here's my reasons why I believe it'll happen:  

* Hanji has stated that the body of a Titan is disproportionally light

* I doubt the Ape Titan stole Mike Zakarius' 3DM Gear just for the purpose of looking at it. Possibly for him or someone else among the titans to develop something similar for the use of the intelligent titans. 

* If it's gonna come down a fight with the Colossal titan, so basically Eren with titan 3DM Gear. Unless of course we see him dealt with in less violent ways. 

I am quite aware of how silly this is damnably sure it. The main flaw being that there barely are any places with obstacles large enough for a titan to utilize the 3DM Gear. I really just wanted to have this post here, it'll happen. ",Manga Spoilers,False,self,t5_2we2n,False,crab23,

Culture: My theory is that the final settlement is based in Europe. The environment seems to show that, and some things are therefore messy when it comes to culture.

* The series uses distinctly European names. ~~Which frustrates me, but I'm not going to talk about that.~~ However, these names range in their origins. For example, ""Jäger"" is a definitively German name. However, ""Eren"" is a Turkish name. ""Grisha"" is a Russian nickname. ""Carla"" is the feminized form of Charles, which is Anglo-Saxon in origin. ""Levi"" is a Hebrew name, found in the Bible. While I'm not going to analyze every name in the series, further hinting at the European origin.

* Maria, basically, although it is assumed to come from the Greeks and then adopted by the Romans. ""Rose"" is the French variant of the Latin word ""rosa."" Finally, ""Sina"" comes from a multitude of European languages, and it's a little difficult to place. (It's interesting to note that ""Sina"" and ""Shina"" are the Japanese transliterations of the Chinese word for ""China"".)

Technology: The technology used seems to reflect a setting in the 19th century. HOWEVER
* Medieval cannonry.

* Canning

* Flintlocks

* Hypodermic syringe

* Cast-iron railways

* Puddling furnaces

* The major anachronism, and it's used in a lot of modern technology like pistons and stuff. The first successful pneumatic motor in our universe was produced in the 1870's. However, those were **big**. Certainly not the size that you could just strap a motor onto you like a fanny pack, because they were designed for trains. Since coal is never shown in the series, it can be assumed that they use pneumatic technology for all methods of transportation.

I had a few AoT Predictions come to my head

In one of the early episodes of Attack, or whatnot.   I don't remember which episode but using this: My theory is that's how the Titans came to be.   Contact with this Yeast.   That's how the Ape Titan turned that village into a Titans within the wall(this theory based on, the immovable Titan resembling Connie's mom(was it Connie?).  

The theme I noticed: Titans have huge duality issues.  Reigner, and from thus I will deduce that ""The Warriors"" are a heartless, lack compassion group of Titan Shifters, stuck on their ""Warrior personality"" by choice/peer pressure?  

Back to the yeast: the yeast is the reason that ""humanity"" is doomed.   All the Warriors gotta do is sprinkle this yeast on everyone within the city

I will guess that once you transform into a Titan, the sooner it can turn back to Human(theory based on Ymir's 60 years of eatting, then 17 year old girl))

The secret behind the wall: I'll guess since we have a huge duality theme, because they chose the humanity, compassionate, emotional side vs. the Warriors.   I would believe that Dr. Jaeger was head or part of the department in working on making stronger Titan yeast to combat the Warriors.   He injected his own son, and left the research data, because the war has begun, and he was out of time.

The Wall, at a major sacrifice to strength, or entrapped Warriors, tricked into forming the wall as they attempted to attack and convert the last bastion of humanity. 

One last theory: The Warriors could also be Titans that refuse to turn human

That's my theories regarding the show.  Thanks for reading.  ^.^

Edit: Theory on the Ape Titan: It's Dr. Jaeger but stuck in his ""Warrior"" personality.

Edit2: Theory based on those opposing the Warriors: another group of Titan shifters, and didn't attempt to convert everyone to Titans because they believed the human/original way of life is better, as opposed to boasting over wielding the power of a strong titan.",Manga Spoilers,False,self,t5_2we2n,g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/1ihpal/attack_on_titan_theorypredictions_manga_reader/
