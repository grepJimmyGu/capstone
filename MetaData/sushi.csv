Hola! Did you take our survey? Do you wanna know the results of the survey? GOOD. 

Included in each result is a graph if you're interested. The numbers below the graph represent the actual counts of the data

^*Category1*:**Amount**

***Click the link to see a sweet graph!***

---

###DEMOGRAPHICS
---


**[Age](http://i.imgur.com/vqdGZQT.png)**

^*13-18*:**77**, ^*31-36*:**25**, ^*37+*:**17**

Surprising absolutely nobody, tell us your age! I'd be really interested to see who claims the title of /r/sushi elder (or grand poobah or whatever you'd rather call yourself). 

---
**[Location](http://i.imgur.com/OYXsTok.png)**

^*U.S.*:**338**, ^*Japan*:**2**, ^*Asia*:**3**, ^*Australia*:**5**, ^*Africa*:**2**, ^*Other*:**5**

Also fairly unsurprising is the number of US responses compared to other countries/regions. For the next survey I will probably split up Europe and Asia more. I know from conversing with a few of you that we have a decent amount of Scandinavian redditors on here (and a few Scandinavian chefs!)

---
###NON-SUSHI STUFF
---
**[Favorite Non-Sushi Food](http://i.imgur.com/W8rVi0q.png)**

^*Pasta*:**227**, ^*Hamburger/Cheeseburger*:**186**, ^*Thai*:**212**, ^*Chinese*:**250**, ^*Greek*:**132**, ^*Indian*:**148**, ^*Other* ^*Japanese*:**201**, ^*Other*:**62**

Guess people like pizza and pasta! Who would've thought? Moroccan seems like an oddball now that I'm writing these results, other Japanese foods, and Thai food! I should've added Korean food, damnit. 

---
**[Favorite Drink](http://i.imgur.com/65NnbU2.png)**

^*Water*:**323**, ^*Cola*:**138**, ^*Juice*:**172**, ^*Smoothies*:**128**, ^*Domestic* ^*Beer*:**144**, ^*Imported* ^*Beer*:**141**, ^*White* ^*Wine*:**72**, ^*Vodka*:**78**, ^*The* ^*Blood* ^*Of* ^*Your* ^*Enemies*:**118**

I am happy that so many of you like water! Or at least you're using it to chase your Vodka, there are quite a few of you who enjoy the blood of your enemies. ^Excellent. 

---
**[Favorite Movie Genre](http://i.imgur.com/SedIcw3.png)**

^*Action*:**239**, ^*Mystery*:**146**, ^*Romance*:**106**, ^*Cult* ^*Classics*:**155**, ^*Foreign* ^*Films*:**126**, ^*Indie* ^*Films*:**146**, ^*Other*:**117**

I know there were some genres I forgot (like freakin B movies!) Oh well

---
**[Favorite TV Shows](http://i.imgur.com/jGR7nxt.png)**

^*The* ^*Walking* ^*Dead*:**111**, ^*Adventure* ^*Time*:**113**, ^*Mad* ^*Men*:**52**, ^*Duck* ^*Dynasty*:**21**, ^*Breaking* ^*Bad*:**136**, ^*Once* ^*Upon* ^*A* ^*Time*:**24**, ^*Other*:**141**

Okay okay, I had to switch to Kwiksurveys WHICH DOESN'T ALLOW WRITE IN ANSWERS WHO DOES THAT. Hence why the really random scattering of choices with an ""other"" thrown in to be a catch all. 

I'm taking recommendations for survey services for the next census though ~~whose results will be more speedy~~

---

**[Favorite Music Genres](http://i.imgur.com/qcY8iT1.png)**

^*Rock*:**255**, ^*Indie*:**184**, ^*Folk*:**96**, ^*Bluegrass*:**42**, ^*R&amp;B*:**61**, ^*Electronic/Dance*:**192**, ^*Pop* ^*Music*:**99**, ^*K-Pop*:**36**

This seems similar to what I see of reddit's music taste in general as well. Classical will be going on the next set of items. 

[^Also ^where ^are ^you ^K-Pop ^Fans? ^I ^will ^find ^you](http://24.media.tumblr.com/a0cc588d71a2487702579f51601d5a2a/tumblr_mnqjkaZm7X1sti0wto8_250.gif)

---

**[Pets](http://i.imgur.com/5BtZQ3x.png)**

^*Dogs*:**148**, ^*Hamsters*:**4**, ^*Other ^Rodents*:**16**, ^*Fish*:**32**, ^*Small* ^*Children*:**21**, ^*None* ^*Of* ^*The* ^*Above/**I* ^*eat* ^*my* ^*pets*:**148**

Nothing too unexpected here either

---
###**SUSHI STUFF**
---

**[How Long Have you Eaten Sushi?](http://i.imgur.com/eiaHtRF.png)**

^*0-1yrs*:**27**, ^*3-4yrs*:**32**, ^*4-5yrs*:**45**, ^*5-6yrs*:**49**. ^*6-10yrs*:**67**, ^*10-15yrs*:**57**, ^*15+yrs*:**47**

I love a good bimodal distribution! I'm really happy we have such a mix though

---
**[How Often Do you Get Sushi?](http://i.imgur.com/YOKEMuy.png)**

^*Once/Twice* ^*a* ^*year*:**16**, ^*Few* ^*Times* ^*a* ^*Month*:**163**, ^*Once* ^*a* ^*Week* ^*or* ^*More*:**62**

Of you 62 at the end

---

**[How Much Do you Spend on Sushi?](http://i.imgur.com/N0uQoED.png)**

^*$0-10*:**32**, ^*$51-75*:**39**, ^*$76-100*:**16**, ^*$100+*:**10**

I'd love to see the correlation between this question and the last one

---

**[Do you Prefer Maki

^*Maki*:**112**, ^*Other/I* ^*LIKE* ^*ALL* ^*OF* ^*THESE* ^*DON'T* ^*HASSLE* ^*ME*:**178**

Nothing too crazy here

---

**[Favorite Maki](http://i.imgur.com/wNRbtB2.png)**

^*Spider* ^*Roll*:**98**, ^*Volcano* ^*Roll*:**73**, ^*Dragon* ^*Roll*:**150**, ^*Tuna* ^*Roll*:**131**, ^*Salmon* ^*Roll*:**145**, ^*Spicy* ^*Tuna* ^*Roll*:**178**, ^*Yellowtail* ^*Roll*:**66**, ^*Super* ^*Crunch* ^*Roll*:**76**

Different rolls do vary depending on which part of the world you live in

---

**[Favorite Non-Sushi Ingredients](http://i.imgur.com/AmIb5Ai.png)**

^*Avocado*:**278**, ^*Wasabi*:**168**,  ^*Tobiko*:**97**, ^*Spicy ^*Mayo*:**173**, ^*Daikon*:**42**, ^*Sweet* ^*Potato*:**52**, ^*Tempura* ^*Bread* ^*Crumbs*:**145**, ^*Other*:**21**

Aw hell

---

**[Favorite Nigiri/Sashimi](http://i.imgur.com/7ol4fM4.png)**

^*Sake(Salmon)*:**289**, ^*Tai(Red* ^*Snapper)*:**70**, ^*Tako(Octopus)*:**87**, ^*Tobiko(Flying* ^*Fish* ^*Roe)*:**63**, ^*Hokkigai(Surf* ^*Clam)*:**41**, ^*Unagi(Eel)*:**177**, ^*Saba(Mackerel)*:**65**, ^*Toro(Fatty* ^*Tuna)*:**167**

Yum yum! I'm a huge fan of Tamago personally. I've had Idako (Baby Octopus) before and it's quite interesting! The consistency was similar to a grape for me

---

**[Do You Make Your Own Sushi at Home?](http://i.imgur.com/V37uEBE.png)**

^*Yes*:**160**

It's awesome how many sushi makers we have here! If you're considering making sushi at home for the first time

We went in with low expectations based on a number of things - particularly the frequent mentions of surly service to foreigners

Much could be said, warm and thoughtful service. Possibly the most expensive meal i've ever eaten in terms of dollars per minute - we were there, maybe 45 minutes? Sushi service lasted 30 min or less - one amuse and then 20 pieces, pretty perfectly spaced out. Easily a top 4 sushi meal for me. 

There are definitely chefs doing stuff with sushi that is more creative (even more traditional), amazing cuts of fish, perfect seasoning. The aged/pickled gizzard shad was my favorite. 

Both Jiro and his son were friendly and joked around with us. Jiro came out after we were done and snapped a picture with the three of us. Unsurprisingly, I don't really understand). Another couple asked for soy sauce (/facepalm).

Overall a great experience. I'd actually consider going back again next time I'm in tokyo

**First things first**, but if you've submitted in the past couple of weeks, you should see your post here soon.

**Second**

**Thirdly**, and nigiri.  If there's a different roll you want, let me know and I'll try to make it. 

I'm not planning on really doing anything different from the way the sub's been running. Just disciplining the spam filter (I'm probably bringing on someone to help do that as well for when I'm not here)


Let me know if you guys want more flair or something!

We finally hit 5000 subscribers guys! We're catching up on those filthy communists at /r/ramen!^^^^/r/ramen^is^actually^a^great^subreddit^dont^hate^them



ANYWAY! I wanna do something that gives back to you guys. This subreddit has really seen some amazing growth over the past few months and it's because of all of your great contributions.  

###First off

This has been suggested by a few of you guys over the past couple of months

These questions came from you guys! Namely /u/sushiallday

It's a fairly short survey and it'd be great if you took it, leave a suggestion in the comments and I'll add it in! 

[http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=z4thde1v9sw8frn122938](http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=z4thde1v9sw8frn122938)

###Now for my favorite part

I've been trying to put in some work here and there on our subreddit wiki. I eventually want it to be a bitchin reference that we can link to whenever someone asks what a good sushi restaurant is in their area

**THERE IS A RESTAURANT PAGE IN THERE! IF YOU WANT TO SHARE A RESTAURANT YOU KNOW IS GOOD

###Finally

I may say this a lot

[http://questionpro.com/t/AJ2cWZPSpN](http://questionpro.com/t/AJ2cWZPSpN)

Every sushi regular knows that regular patron-ship of your favorite sushi restaurant tends towards receiving special treats by the chef(s) of that restaurant. Whether its sashimi

Here are a few of mine:

* **LIVE**, and the chef doesn't shear the bottom off of it to harvest the uni until right before he's ready to put it on your plate. This, my friends, is one of the finest combinations of flavor/texture that the ocean has to offer.

* Spanish mackerel(aji) sushi/sashimi. Should be served with ponzu sauce, and(maybe) lemon. And no, if any of you are thinking that this fish tastes anything like the usual mackerel(saba) that you can find in every restaurant, let me reassure you that this fish is nothing like its pungent cousin. Seriously, try and find a spot where you can order this delicious fish.

* Spicy Tuna/Octopus Roll - basically your average spicy tuna roll but jazzed up by adding pieces of octopus(tako), in my opinion, one of the more under appreciated fish, despite being one of the staple menu items and, thus, served basically everywhere.

* Salmon belly sashimi - If the chef at your restaurant receives entire salmon for breaking down, and you come in on the days that you know he's breaking down his fish, ask if he'll cut you a special order of sashimi from the belly meat of the salmon. The pieces are smaller so I usually cut 15 pieces of this ""mini sashimi"" as an equivalent to a 5 piece order of the standard size. Personally, I find this meat to be a lot more flavorful than the rest of the fish and usually regret that it's mostly just used for making Philadelphia rolls.

These are just a few of my personal favorites. I could definitely go on

What are some of *your* favorites? I want to know what makes sushi particularly delightful for you so that I can bring those elements into my own enjoyment of the cuisine and share them with my own customers.

**EDIT:** Sometimes I also like to put scallops into the spicy tuna/octopus mix described earlier for that extra bit of texture and unctuousness.

Protip: Many of the rolls offered at most sushi restaurants start with a CA roll(imitation crab, with other ingredients added to the top. Now, I've nothing against CA rolls, as their popularity in CA and this type of basic format for structuring rolls allows us to make all the CA rolls needed ahead of time so that they are rolled and ready when a customer orders and their order can be filled in a more timely manner. Having said that, the CA roll is basically the entry level roll, designed for novice sushi seekers yet unsure of what they like or can tolerate. It's pretty low on my *Chart of Ascendingly Awesome Sushi*(chart does not actually exist). Since there's basically no where to go but up, substituting almost anything else for the CA roll base will greatly enhance the flavor and mouth feel of a roll. My usual goto: the spicy tuna roll. An extra dollar or two and your boring, substitute that shizz for something more interesting like a spicy tuna roll.",t5_2qm24,True

Hello /r/Sushi! over the past couple of months we've really started to pick up in traffic, and we seemingly jumped from ~2800 people to ~3500 people in a short amount of time. 

That being said

**RECENT CHANGES**

* I put some new links in the sidebar

* I also posted a link to sushinut.com after the [great discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/16p1br/wanted_to_give_a_shout_out_to_my_friends_new/) we had in /u/war3rd 's thread. 

* I removed the link to the wikipedia page on sushi because lol. 




**POSSIBLE UPCOMING UHHH STUFF**

* I would really like to start using redditor's sushi pictures on the side bar rather then the ones I ~~egregiously steal~~ get from tumblr. If you like this idea please tell me in the comments and I'll start fleshing this idea out more. It'd probably involve having a timestamp somewhere in the picture. 

* Do you guys want more flair? Do you have a favorite roll/fish that you'd like to see as a flair? Tell me! 

* The header is kind of old

*While I'm really happy with the discussions we're having in the subreddit

* **On the flipside of the previous point however, there's no reason to have it on someone's post**


**THOUGHTS**

I was really on the fence about doing a /r/bestof2012 contest in here

We went over how to make temaki (hand rolls)

As is the case with Oishii

I got the distinct impression that what they do in the class varies based on who's there, meaning that you could go back a couple of months later and probably get a different experience. (Chef Ting said to mention when booking if you're a repeat customer. Also, to book the class I just called a few days in advance.)

  I spent all of thirty seconds researching each individual item and they were chosen for three reasons, and they came near the top during my search.  The item is what is important not the brand, so feel free to dig a little deeper, and surely the more you're willing to spend the greater quality you will find. 

**THE BASICS**

Rice is what makes sushi
  Unless your first name is Jiro

  
While we're on the subject of rice, plastic or wood, a wooden bowl known as a [hangiri](http://www.amazon.com/BambooImportsMN-Sushi-Hangiri-Making-Accessory/dp/B005UOR6G2/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374524719&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=hangiri) is by far the best option and will give your sushi making an air of authenticity. Link is to a whole packet, as bamboo mats are also important, but aren't otherwise on this list. 
  

If you want pretty, but if you're only doing this as an occasional hobby, should be fine, if you're looking to step it up, I'd definitely put down a bit more money.

**Other useful items**

If you want your rolls to not looked squished when you cut them, invest more money, hobby chefs, should be fine, and any decent well sharpen chefs knife should work.  

No matter how expensive your knife was when you bought it, sushi or not. 

If you're gonna go through all the freaking effort of making sushi at home for fucks sake get [sushi rice](http://www.amazon.com/Nishiki-Premium-Medium-Grain-15-Pound/dp/B004NRLAVY/ref=sr_sp-btf_title_1_5?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374526347&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=calrose+rice)
This is the only item on the list I'm personally familiar with

Give yourself space to work

Anyway this list could go on for a long time

  If anyone has any questions I'll be around for a few hours now and more tomorrow
