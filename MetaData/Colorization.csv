I have already posted this but I have gotten enough response that I felt it should go back up.
For christmas I am doing free restoration and colorization of photos. They make great gifts for the holidays. I am only doing 1 per email for free. Sadly if i did a lot for each person i would be broke. But anyone who i help out during this time will be able to get some nice discounts for their family and friends. I want to be affordable. 
So feel free to visit my site soapyforkstudios.com or email me @ soapyforkstudios@gmail.com

Make sure your photos are scanned at at least 300 dpi. :)
EDIT:
Also please please please tell me when you want you photo done by. I know some people don't need it done for a little bit but others may need their photos done more urgently. Letting me know when you need your photo completed by will help me prioritize when i complete each project.
