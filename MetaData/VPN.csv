My problem:

* Purchased a NordVPN subscription last month.
* Couldn't connect for the majority of the time.
* When I did connect
* Other VPN services I used remained stable and unaffected.

Attempted resolution:

* Emailed NordVPN several times with the problem and requested a refund (after only 24 hours).
* They responded
* I asked again for a refund. No response.
* I warned them several times I was going to issue a chargeback as I haven't been able to use the service at all.
* No response still.

Their terms and conditions **used to** state:

”If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase

They have since removed that from [the page](http://www.nordvpn.com/terms-of-service/).

#I've since raised a chargeback and hope they get stung with hefty fees.

Encryption strength is something that many get wrong

  How can you

First of all you should know how OpenVPN works. It is based on a client-server connection and the client configuration has to match the server configuration

Basically

If the cipher is not specified, because it will tell you what encryption cipher it is using. Depending on provider, you may need to add a ""verb 3 [to 5]"" line in the .ovpn config file to see that.   

There is absolutely nothing wrong with BF 128-bit like being insecure - it's only a matter of claims &amp; deceiving customers into buying something that's different from reality. I don't know about you

This being said

I had constant Issues with Hidemyass.com; from DMCA notices to account closures on a weekly basis. Apparently my credit card and physical address were blacklisted by their system as I tried to renew my subscription WHILE I was behind their VPN service, and send me requests to delete certain types of files I had downloaded from my computer threatening to cancel my service. I felt safer not having the VPN service connected at all, and dealing with my ISP was immensely more pleasurable.

Ever since I switched to PIA, no e-mails, I'm pretty much left alone. Not to mention the numerous payments methods available. A few weeks ago I was experiencing slow download speeds through my Bittorrent client due to something on my end; regardless, a PIA Customer Service Representative helped me trouble shoot the problem even though it had nothing to do with their VPN client. They also helped me configure the Bittorrent client so I got the best performance while connected to their VPN service. As I'm on a Mac, the Customer Service Representative booted up a Mac and told me exactly where to look and what to change. If this isn't phenomenal customer service, I don't know what is.

###What is a VPN?

VPN is an acronym for [Virtual Private Network] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network). 

A VPN is a network technology that creates a secure network connection over a public network such as the Internet or a private network owned by a service provider. Large corporations

A VPN can connect multiple sites over a large distance just like a Wide Area Network (WAN). VPNs are often used to extend intranets worldwide to disseminate information and news to a wide user base. Educational institutions use VPNs to connect campuses that can be distributed across the country or around the world.

In order to gain access to the private network

VPN in the way we mean and use it is not that much different to the described way. We join a virtual private network from a VPN provider and get a not public routed IP and can access the internet through NAT (like adding default gateway to the VPN one). And for securing our connection they also do not log anything (&lt;- that's not standard

###Whats the difference between surfing the web anonymously and Torrenting anonymously?

You can only anonymously download torrents with a VPN service. You can surf the web anonymously with a [Proxy service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) or with a VPN service.

###I see a lot of ""Free VPN Services"" is this possible or are they just scamming me.

* IVPN - $100.00/yr - (http://www.ivpn.net/)
* Mullvad 5€/month
* Perfect-Privacy 150€/yr
* VPNTunnel 5€/month

###There are a lot of companies out there offering VPN services. What are the top 3 most trusted

Not that easy to answer

###What is the best balance of quality with monthly cost?

Personally I would say 5-10€ are fine

###What are the top 3 most trusted, blackberry and iOS?

... 

###Should I always run my VPN? Even when gaming or shopping online?

For gaming, and isn't really needed.  The only times it could help would be when you log into the game with username/password, or if the game has an online/in-game store you're buying from with a real credit card.  You should verify that communications with the login screen and store are encrypted (as they should be and probably are on every major online game) before using it.

For shopping - if the shopping site uses https:// for every page, but the not the contents of your communications with it.  If you want to eliminate the possibility of eavesdroppers or men-in-the-middle seeing even what store you are shopping at then you should use a VPN.

Private Internet Access
TWC RoadRunner

VPNs are a great tool for hiding your internet traffic, but these seem to have mixed results, and have been known to leak some amount of traffic through when reconnecting.  Personally I would rather put my trust in a piece of networking hardware than a route table modifying application running on my computer itself.

My solution was to set up my wireless AP to broadcast two SSIDs at once

One of the SSIDs runs my typical home network

For example

1.  Allow   108.61.0.0/16
2.  Allow   66.55.141.0/24
3.  Allow   66.237.37.0/24
4.  Deny    All

You could rachet it in even tighter by specifically allowing each individual IP

This is the ""VPN only"" SSID, all traffic passing through my AP is dropped as well.  The SSID doesn't go down though, so my computer stays connected to it and continues to try to pass traffic to it with zero success.

My AP can run multiple SSIDs and apply policies to each which made this easy, guests, printer, xbox, netflix streaming dvd player, etc).",,,,

--------------------------

* It will work if your vpn provider lets you connect through Windows' VPN PPTP setup (example: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#windows7_pptp) 

There is a readme.txt file that explains how it works. Enter your vpn settings in settings.cmd.

* Run startvpn.cmd to connect to vpn and stopvpn.cmd to disconnect.

* startvpn.cmd will start a long running loop that runs every 120 seconds (editable). If VPN is currently connected, it will run the app if it isn't already running.

* stopvpn.cmd sets up the params so the script will disconnect vpn

I currently use HMA to circumvent regional restrictions for Netflix et. al. and that's been working out perfectly fine for me.  I switch it on when I need to ""look American"" and otherwise rarely use it.  I tend to be very ""wired in"" in the sense that I use all sorts of cloud-based services between my various devices and I use social media extensively for work.  For the most part I have no problem with leaving an online footprint with my day-to-day web-browsing and actively like some of the targeted ads I receive from places like Google.  

That all being said, I'm a little miffed that I can't use my iTunes purchases on it (outside of music) and their don't seem to be any services that allow me to buy movies and TV shows DRM-free.  As such, I thought I'd complement that with some torrenting but I'm super paranoid despite the fact that I live in Canada where that isn't *quite* as much of an issue (though likely will be in the nearish future).

I've gone ahead and set up a Crunchbang install through virtual box and it is running fine through my current HMA VPN (I load the VPN, however, I've decided to purchase a 1-year subscription to PIA given that HMA has a poor reputation for handing over user-data and PIA seems to be the general recommendation for that.  Given that I've still got about six months left of my HMA subscription I thought I might even try to chain them together for extra redundancy.  

ANYWAY ... a lot of people seem to recommend purchasing your subscription through bitcoins or other anonymous currencies but that seems like a fair bit of work for someone who just wants to download the occasional torrent off a public tracker or browse with some degree of anonymity when I want to.  Given these circumstances

**tl;dr**
Will I be shooting myself in the foot buying a PIA subscription with my credit card if I'll only be using it for public torrent trackers and the occasional private browsing within my virtual machine, or anything messed up like that - I just want to be able to torrent in some degree of peace.  Summary:

-I live in Canada

-Anything ""sensitive"" will occur inside of a VM under a user account with a fake persona and where I will not be logging into anything that could tie it to my real life.  What happens in the VM stays in the VM (aside from dumping media to my media server).

-My regular browsing and day-to-day activity will still take place on my regular (non-VM) Windows install.
-I already use HMA but am concerned about their reputation in this regard.

Taken from PrivatVPN.se/en/
1.) We don’t keep ANY logs that allow us or a 3rd party to match an IP address and a time stamp to a user our service. The only thing we log are e-mails and user names but it’s not possible to bind a activity on the Internet to a user. This applies to all our servers except our U.S. servers.
[Note: We’re logging IP addresses and time stamp on the incoming connection for our U.S. servers. We offer no anonymity on our U.S. servers.]

2.) We operate in Swedish jurisdiction. Since we do not log any IP addresses we have nothing to disclose. Circumstances doesn’t matter in this case

^ So after that I have a couple questions I was hoping someone might be able to answer for me.

- If there are no logs kept
&amp;
- Because *I am located* in the U.S. (my ISP is in America)

I'm a novice when it comes to this type of thing, if someone would help me understand this more clearly because I'd hate to do something foolish like torrent and be logged while doing so.

The server is on a Ubuntu machine.  

I have two clients at home on my Windows 7 machine; OpenVPN GUI and Securepoint SSL VPN.  I only run one at a time and when I do I right click and run as administrator.

Both clients claim success at establishing connections.

For me, importing a config file, it wouldn't let me save due to permissions, and after rebooting it was there and I could type and save my password.

Anyway, they're the [Ubuntu OpenVPN instructions](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#ubuntu_openvpn). However, instead of creating a VPN, when adding at the bottom hit ""Import an existing configuration"". From that zip file you downloaded from PIA (link titled 'OpenVPN Configuration Files'), find the server you want. For example, CA - Toronto.ovpn.  If you get an error, reboot and try it again. I don't know a faster way.

Everything's preset except your username and password. Type this in and hit apply. You may be able to connect now by going to the network manager dropdown, try rebooting. After that, you should _definitely_ get asked for the password again, and have the option to save it to your keychain.  You want to do this.

Do I have to and/or would you recommend using OpenVPN? The thing about OpenVPN is that I have been trying to get it working on and off for the past week. I have tried to follow numerous guides (some found at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/11vmnf/how_to_use_a_freetier_amazon_aws_ec2_cloud_server/) helpful post) but they all seem to be written for windows users or people familiar with Unix commands and command line know-how.

Recently we got a PIA account for a month in order to test it, so forgive us if our idea seems incredibly crazy, stupid or naive) was to keep using the Router1 to access the internet and flash Router2 with Tomato or DD-WRT so it could get an internet connection form Router1, while acting as an OpenVPN client and routing the VPN connection to the other computers over wireless and cable. The idea is, that you could connect to Router2 if you want to use the VPN or to Router1 if you want the normal connection (for whatever reason). 

Now after reading some post here I got the idea that the encryption might be a bit too much for the WRT54GL’s 200 MHz processor and could become the bottleneck for this reason, 120 GB Hard Drive) and a USB Ethernet adapter, so maybe I can put that computer between the two routers and let it handle the VPN connection, so I don’t have to worry about not having enough processing power for the encryption. So we proceeded and installed pfSense on the machine and plugged it in. 

Now long story short

So I guess the concrete questions would be:

* Is this configuration a good idea at all (taking into account that we really don’t want to buy any new equipment)? And if not

Unlike most users of this sub, I'm talking about using a VPN to tunnel back to my home network, to prevent local network snooping, and to help me access services behind my firewall

When I'm on a public connection, and I'd be running it even if it didn't support tunnelling

The only disadvantage is that global VPN support is built into most OSes, so this is not a problem for me), and the fact that it's easier to make your computers behave as though they are on the same network, whereas SSH tunnelling isn't a 'real' VPN in the same way

I know OpenVPN has the advantage of native support in DD-WRT etc., not everything on my network (if I was on my network, I wouldn't be tunnelling), and I'm fine using my Raspberry Pi as a server (if I really wanted to, it's possible to use DD-WRT as both a WAN SSH server and a global SSH proxy with IPTABLES)

What would I gain from using a full VPN like OpenVPN? It seems [really hard to set up](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN) in comparison to the 2 commands needed to install and start an SSH server

I've heard PPTP is easy to set up, and I don't have to use keys, just passwords (though keys are more secure, I know). Is this true?

PS: In case I was unclear: **I'm not talking about whether I should be using a 'hosted' VPN for privacy** (eg. PIA)

----

**TL;DR:** I'm fine using SSH tunnels. Should I not be?

----

appendix (stop reading here unless you want to do the same):

For anyone wanting to do the same

    ssh -CD &lt;local port&gt; [-p &lt;SSH server port&gt;] [-N] &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;

C is compression

D &lt;local port&gt; is the port to bind to on your local machine. Use a port&gt;1000 so you don't need root.

p is only needed if your server doesn't run on TCP 22

N means no shell will be started. I personally don't bother

Now tell all your apps to use SOCKS5 proxy 127.0.0.1:&lt;local port&gt;. Some apps may leak DNS requests. Firefox requires about:config changes (though Foxyproxy will do that for you)

If your connection hangs

If you're good with IPTABLES, but in that case, you don't need my help",,False,,t5_2qxhk,,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1izdz8/what_are_the_advantages_of_using_a_full_vpn/

- Are there any other things to watch out for when using their service? Is there a way to exactly configure which programs use the vpn and which ones don't? (linux)

- I also want to use it on my android phone. I suppose that PIA would here also be able to see everything I do as long as it's not encrypted? (e.g. read my mails when I'm fetching them?)

- Lets say I'm connected via PIA but at the same time logged in when doing a google search. (Now this is a legal question): In case I search for something illegal

- As long as I'm connected using openvpn (gnome network manager) EVERYTHING is encrypted

1350604489.0,11pwa5,[F] [-L] VPNBook. Automated connection with python script,Tard_Hunter,11,2,12,"**EDIT 4**: Python script no longer needed. If you'd like to start and connect automatically just create a task scheduler to start the OpenVPN GUI with the parameter ""*--connect*"" to startup at login.

""C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn-gui-1.0.3.exe"" **--connect vpnbook.ovpn**

In the config file ensure you have ""*auth-user-pass LoginConfig.txt*"" with a text file named LoginConfig.txt in the same directory as the config file containing:

**freeopenvpn
J8hfCiu6W**

And that should work. 


So I made a post about this [website](http://www.vpnbook.com) which allows both PPTP and a free OpenVPN account to be used. After discussions in the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/115lb5/vpnbook_free_vpn_service_also_python_script_for/) I decided to use the OpenVPN service instead of PPTP and to automate the login as they change their password routinely anywhere between 24 - 48 hours.

**PLEASE NOTE I INSTALLED OPENVPN CLIENT USING THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY WHICH IS C:\Program Files\OpenVPN**
**If THIS IS DIFFERENT THEN YOU'LL NEED TO MODIFY THE TUTORIAL ACCORDINGLY**

 The resulting python script is this:

    import urllib
    import sys
    import os

    f = urllib.urlopen(""http://www.vpnbook.com"")

    b = f.read()

    f.close()

    def find_between( s
        try:
            start = s.index( first ) + len( first )
            end = s.index( last
            return s[start:end]
        except ValueError:
            return """"

    password_dirty = find_between(b

    password = password_dirty[35:44]

    f = open(""C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\password.txt""

    f.write(""freeopenvpn\n"" + password)

    f.close()

    os.system( '""C:\\Program Files\\OpenVPN\\bin\\openvpn-gui-1.0.3.exe"" --connect vpnbook.ovpn' )

This python code will go off and grab the current password from their website

To set up VPNBook with OpenVPN you'll want to grab the [OpenVPN client](http://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-2.2.2-install.exe)(assuming windows here) if you haven't done so already then you'll want the certificates from VPNBook's Website

*auth-user-pass* **-&gt;** *auth-user-pass password.txt*

This will look for the username and password in the file password.txt located in the config directory.

Now all that is left is to do is create a schedule to run the python script every hour or so to ensure the connection is always correct when it changes. Also having it run at start-up wouldn't be a bad idea either.

Any question just post.

Cheers. Adam.

**EDIT**: I have just noticed they have changed their certificate files for two different port numbers. One being [UDP port 81](http://www.vpnbook.com/free-openvpn-account/vpnbook-udp81.zip) and the other being [TCP port 443](http://www.vpnbook.com/free-openvpn-account/vpnbook-tcp443.zip).


&gt;You should use TCP 443 profile (harder to block by firewall) if you cannot connect via UDP.


**EDIT 2**: I have now re written the script and it's working with the TCP package although the UDP package is throwing a wobble
[Python 2.7.3 Version](http://pastebin.com/E2JNttc5)
[Python 3.3.0 Version](http://pastebin.com/vv8w6Z0P)

Mild editing will be needed

**EDIT 3**: I have noticed a possible typo in the UDP config file. I have changed:
    dev tun
to:
    dev tun1
as this is what the TCP config contains and it works beautifully

1374072472.0,1ihl28,Can't get openVPN to boot with Raspbmc...,russ_b,6,0,2,"I'm putting together a Raspbmc rig for my mother in law to use as a media centre. I have it up and running with openVPN so she can access my home server. It works perfectly

I've done various testing using my Linux Mint 15 rig and can get it to autoboot no problem

Here's what I've done:


I have my keys


myvpn.conf looks like this:


* remote &lt;replaced my IP with this&gt; 1194
* client
* dev tun
* proto udp
* resolv-retry infinite
* nobind
* persist-key
* persist-tun
* ca /etc/openvpn/ca-cert.crt
* cert /etc/openvpn/&lt;replaced with this&gt;Client.crt
* key /etc/openvpn/&lt;replaced with this&gt;Client.key
* comp-lzo
* verb 3
* auth-user-pass


I've appeded to /etc/rc.local with this:


* cd /etc/openvpn ; 
* sudo ./autosignon &amp;
* exit 0


and autosignon looks like this (and I've installed 'expect'):


    #!/usr/bin/expect -f
    set force_conservative 0
    if {$force_conservative} {
        set send_slow {1 .1}
        proc send {ignore arg} {
                sleep .1
                exp_send -s -- $arg
        }
    }

    set timeout -1
    spawn openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/myvpn.conf
    match_max 100000
    expect -exact ""Enter Auth Username:""
    send -- ""
    expect -exact ""Enter Auth Password:""
    send -- ""&lt;replaced with this&gt;\r""
    expect eof



I've run the autosignon script and it starts openvpn no problem, but it doesn't change. 


I've also Chmod'd autosignon and rc.local. I've tried using 'sudo' to kick off the scripts and I've also tried putting all of this into root and re-assigning the paths there (as one forum recommended). No luck - it just wont start at boot time. 


Finally, but to no avail).


Like I've said

Anyone got any ideas? It's been a few days of research and testing now and I'm reaching the end of my tether!

I will try to be go so much in detail that I can so this post might be long

I am currently trying to configure a Cisco 3725 to act as a Easy VPN server. When my company starts a project with a customer

This setup is somewhat insecure since there are really no restrictions setup on the users connecting to our Project Area Network. Now I want to see if I can make this connection better

The plan is to make a Cisco 3725 to act as a Easy VPN server

I have made a topology of this scenario in GNS3 ([HERE IS THE TOPOLOGY](http://i.imgur.com/3ndJeqY.jpg)), VRF lan20, VLAN 20, IP 10.100.20.10/24.

**Problem:**

I manage to get up the tunnel between the VPN Client *Host* and the Easy VPN Server *R2_3725*

[Full configuration on R2_3725](http://textuploader.com/?p=6&amp;id=ufr5M). As you can see

When I issue *sh crypto isakmp sa*:

I live in a dorm with very strict internet regulation and because of that all the native iOS VPN options won't work for me. (for example: on my laptop I had to switch to TCP instead of UDP and had to use port 443. I'm not able to set this up in the native iOS options).


Thats why I installed OpenVPN and used it with HideMyAss which worked good. Today my subscription ended and I moved to PIA. 

The problem with PIA in combination with OpenVPN on iOS seems to be that PIA uses a different system for their .crt somehow. Thats why I get the error: ""No certificates are present in the Keychain"".

After some googling I found a thread in the OpenVPN forums (https://forums.openvpn.net/topic12133.html) in which was stated:
""It seems that the app explicitly asks for a ""client.key"" and ""client.crt"". Otherwise it just gives the notification that no certificates are present""

I'm not that tech savvy and don't know what to do now. Anybody here able and willing to help?

I live in Texas but selected a gateway outside the US (Europe) thinking the farther i was away - the safer i would be. I was getting torrent d/l speeds of 3-4 kb/s 

Even though i'm not connected to a port forwarding gateway and connected to a gateway very close - am i still safe?  

CheckMyIP Results:   Using outside US gateway - country shows unknown // using Tx gateway -- country shows US 

DNS Leak Check:  Now that i've selected DNS Leak Protection

Is port forwarding required to become anonymous?
Does connecting to a gateway close to my current location make me less safe than if i went out of the US ?
Are the terrible speeds to be expected when connecting to far off gateway?

However

I am currently using the PIA VPN with Windows 7 64bit and Chrome.

I have set up my VPN connection to PIA via their PPTP steps:
https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#windows7_pptp
I honestly don't want to 'install' anything just to gain VPN access when VPN connections are a built-in function to all operating systems.

I've tried to manually clear the DNS
And it still has not worked either.

I've also tried changing the DNS servers to 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220.   Also tried Google's public DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

Nothing has worked and I still have MANY pages that don't load properly.

For the most part, using my Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.8.2 and it works WONDERFULLY.  ALL sites load in a snap.  www.dnsleaktest.com loads super fast and I pass the leak test 100% of the time with ISP listing as all from xxxx.Level3.xxxx (which is PIA) and everything else loads.

What the heck is going on here?

Do I HAVE to use PIA's little installer tool?  I had a friend use that

EDIT: So I forced 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 as my DNS for the VPN connection and now I am finally able to load and run dnsleaktest.com (granted it is super duper slow).  I am getting the following for my hostname: m11.lax.opendns.com

I think I want to give you a public IP address.   Idea being, and you then have a public IP you can run servers on or whatever if you want.   (I mean, I don't expect you to run a major service on your comcast line, it would suck because your comcast line sucks.  But I won't be charging you major money, either.)     

A dynamic address (or nat) service is also possible for outgoing-only, something I disconnect my current customers for, if you don't have incoming connections.)   I can also disallow certain outgoing dest. ports, for instance, I could block port 25, and vastly reduce the service's potential utility as a spam cannon.   (That won't block all spam/abuse, of course

Now, well, I need to do more research as to my legal responsabilities and stuff... but I think that transparency is absolutely key.    I'd have some mechanisim (either sftp authenticated with a key or a web portal with a password or something) that would allow you to download all the logs that have to do with you.

The other thing, I don't have a bunch of lawyers sitting around.   (I might be open to partnering with a lawyer, but as-is?  I don't want to deal with it.)

I mean, I have considered tackling the SMB market with this; e.g. you can outsource running your office VPNs to me, and I can, you know, throw things like storage devices or your co-located servers on that same VPN, but usually that's a lower volume, high margin market

What I find amusing about the current market is that the vpns that don't give you a static IP, well, I would price things the other way around.  I wonder if a static IP VPN service that required a year prepay (or something else to discourage spammers from signing up, taking a dump all over my network and leaving) that was priced (and offered the same level of support, e.g., not very much)  as a dynamic IP/nat VPN service would sell well?

- An android phone

- A laptop

- Does every device open up it's own tunnel to PIA? Unless I set PIA up as a vpn in my router they should

- Can anybody else than PIA tell that different devices all belong to me/are connected to each other in any way and therefore connect my legal and not so legal activities?

Is there any actual advantage in using my laptop and my desktop pc or does it not make a difference?

The reason for choosing these guys was that they have a server in New Zealand

Most of the free to air TV stations in NZ have an ondemand service and with Astrills Open Web or Open VPN protocol they all work fine.

New Zealand also has Sky TV which is the Paid TV Service in NZ.  They have an ondemand service and a few channels which you can watch live [http://www.isky.co.nz/](http://www.isky.co.nz/)

This is accessible if you have an paid account with them (which my parents do

The problem is

Could they have blocked Astrills NZ IP?

I'm new to VPNs. I signed up with PIA tonight and I'm having trouble at every turn.

I need to make sure that the BT client won't connect with my real IP if I forget to connect to the VPN or the VPN goes down.

I tried creating the VPN connection through Windows 7 and setting uTorrent's net.bind_ip/outgoing_ip parameters to the adapter's IP

PIA has a proxy that I could use

I also tried using PIA's application and setting up rules in a software firewall to block uTorrent if it's not connecting through the VPN adapter. I followed [this guide](http://www.tuvpn.com/en/faqs/block-certain-applications-if-vpn-down) for Comodo. The rules to allow uTorrent through aren't kicking it
