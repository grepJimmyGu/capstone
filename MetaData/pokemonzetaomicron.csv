(Even if you haven't had any questions and you're been subscribed for quite a while

.

***

1) Releases and Testing

***
.

**When is this game coming out**?

&gt;Not sure. I don't want to give out a concrete date because it's likely going to change. However

**Will there be Alpha/Beta Releases? When?**
&gt;Yes. I'm going to be doing an alpha release fairly soon but to a closed group of testers. The beta demo will be open for whomever wants to play

**Can I be an Alpha/Beta tester?**
&gt;Everyone can be a beta tester! The Beldum beta tester flair will be given to whomever downloads the game before the final release.

&gt;Alpha testing will be kept to a smaller group of people

**Ok
&gt;I have a couple people in mind. PLEASE don't PM me or comment asking to be one

**Can I help with [topic]?**

&gt; As of right now, then we will ask.

.

***

2) The Program 

***

.

**What ROM is this game a hack of?**

&gt;This game is NOT A HACK. It is a stand-alone game

**An exe file? Will it run on Mac?**

&gt;Hopefully

**Will there be multiple save slots?**

&gt;The way the game is designed

**Will this be for iPhone/Android/Mobile/DS/Gameboy?**

&gt; Nononononononononononononono. Sorry.

.

***

3) The Game (Plot and More)

***

.

**Will these games have legendary mascots? Who are they?**

&gt;Yes. They are Jirachi (Zeta) and Victini (Omicron)

**Will (insert pokemon here) be in the game?**

&gt;Yes. All 649 Pokemon will be avaliable in the game (However

**How do I get version-exclusive legendaries on the other game?**

&gt;There is a GTS in Zeta and Omicron

**I have an idea! Put (idea) in!**

&gt;If you have any ideas

**Fakemon?**

&gt;Sort of. There are 5 currently in the game (1 is actually acquirable). 4 of them are purely for plot purposes

**I heard you had a Nuzlocke Mode! How does that work?**

&gt;It's very simple right now- your Pokemon cannot be revived. The Nurse won't heal you

&gt;There is also a Nuzlocke Shop with certain exclusive items to help you out.

**I heard you had a Secret Base! How does that work?**

&gt;It works like Skyrim does. You can find the base

**The starters are unbalanced!**

&gt; Don't worry. I boosted Bellsprout's stats and nerfed Horsea and Magby's to keep them on par with regular starters.",self,t5_2wflg,1369068784.0,,1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1cl9vv/frequently_asked_questions/

Second Edit:
Darkrabbit713's idea is great! Here's a brief summary-Capture of Fakemon isnt nessisary to complete the national dex and are obtainable after the E4/end of plot.  NPCs have knowlege of ""new evolutions"" and one can trade to obtain the Fakemon if one so desires. 
That way, with no impact on their overall gameplay experience, while those who would like these Fakemon, can interact with these NPCs and obtain these Fakemon.

1367850372.0,1dskgl,Evolutionary stones,Agitatedleader,63,7,28,So it has come to my attention that with all the pokemon that current exist in the world that the problem that was presented in later games like DPPt that bothered me was the amount of pokemon that required stones of the elements to evolve to their next form. However though in the older games like Gen 1 the department store sold the stones that you could use for making pokemon like your eevee's evolve into their different form. But now in the later games you can't do that despite the fact that there is more and more pokemon present that now require them now more then ever. So what I was thinking that could be done to counter act this sudden need for evolution stones would be to make them avaliable for sale in the deptmarment store again but at a much higher price then most oridnary objects.,t5_2wflg,True

A while ago I put up a short poll in which around 400 of you responded to. The results of this poll can be found in the link below

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zcTlWGuvZ9OBKocFmiOBNhOryU-YDUcgNQU72C3JHCE/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics

While 78% of you wanted the standard trainer to be like the ""Farmer McDonald"" model in which the pokemon in their team all suit a specific purpose, I proudly introduce a new series of sidequest trainers that will be available after you collect all 8 badges! [These can be completed before the Elite Four, if you wish]

I have come up with a handful of sidequests that will involve the occupations YOU suggested while fitting into the ""Farmer McDonald"" model. So...

As a prime example of this ""sidequest trainer"", Farmer McDonald. In order to battle him and receive a unique prize, you must first return to him 3 Mareep and/or Flaffy for his flock. He will then give you a moment to get your team ready [a PC will be nearby]. Farmer McDonald's team consists of Dugtrio, Cacturne, Pelliper, Tauros, and Herdier. As a prize, Milk Drink

Farmer McDonald is a good example of the kinds of modern-day RPG sidequests that will be tied into the old-school Pokemon formula. The other sidequests will include interactions and battles with Chef Pierre, and Politician Baldwin. Just to tease you guys some more, Chef Pierre has a Farfetch'd, Fireman George has a Blastoise, SWAT Officer Gordan has a Bastiodon, and Politician Baldwin has a Hypno.


Hope that satisfies you guys for now! Stay tuned for some more info soon.

Team Asgard/Olympus

The ancient legends say Arceus created the world in the depths of the void, and created life to inhabit them all. They say he disappeared and fell into a deep sleep for millions of years.

If Arceus created the world

Well, and they will do anything to control it. They began their takeover of the Vesryn Region, methodically taking over every town, starting with the fairly small village of Nyasa.

Your town. Now it's personal.

Your mother is one of the greatest trainers in the region. She single-handedly tamed rare Pokemon and defeated the Elite Four. Under her guidance, and tells her holy-crap-Team-Asgard/Olympus's-here-we-need-your-help, and being the good samitarian she is, she leaves, leaving you to find the emergency Pokemon and make your way to Zarivar Town, where the Professor awaits.

I'll provide you some basic information on the trainer

So here we are!

Trainer Name: **Gideon**

Basic Info: Gideon is the second Gym Leader of the game. He uses grass type Pokemon and his favourite Pokemon is Nuzleaf. His sprites can be found [here](http://pokemonzetaomicron.wikia.com/wiki/Onega_Town).

I booted up the competition earlier today, we got 25 well-written well-thought out backstories to the Gideon character.

The winner is SuperShuckle.
&gt;Gideon was once a famous actor, Gideon was forced into retirement. Now, with the help of his grass Pokemon, he is able to use nature to his advantage and absorb nutrients through the vines running around his body, which in turn helps him walk upright with the use of a cane. He can usually be found at the museum, reminiscing about the days when he was the star of the show.

The reason we chose this is because it was relatively short and was very clever and creative, proving that you guys didn't totally hate his story :\)

I would like to say I am blown away by the stories. [fragileteeth](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1el4fh/backstory_competition_gideon_the_2nd_gym_leader/ca1bfma)'s and [acoustic_waves](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1el4fh/backstory_competition_gideon_the_2nd_gym_leader/ca1bds8)' backstories are examples of well written ones that just ended up being too long and too complicated to fit in.

Thanks for paticipating

First off, mind you) could be mitigated completely if one were to give him a water type custom move with 70 power, as it scales off his attack (physical!) 
Secondly, maybe, 25. Now assume it knows a water custom, steel custom, and bug custom along with a swords dance equivalent/swords dance. It would already have a moveset better than a, say, a non custom move Scizor at level 40.
Finally, very strong. If a Pokemon could get technician on these, it could easily sweep through the gyms. Example: oh no! I'm stuck on the 7th gym. Welp, time to buy a move that hard counters it! It's just simply too good. 

My suggestion: make the moves' power scale with badges you own, only one custom move per Pokemon would be good - and that move should be something that matches its typing.

Tl;dr: custom moves need to be toned down a bit but should scale to be good later on.

2 exciting games, 2 nefarious plots, but only 1 hero to stop them all. Will you be that hero? Or will you fall prey to the wilds of the Vesryn region?

**Information**
These two games, as well as being the only game that has two separate counterparts (Zeta and Omicron) which fits the Pokemon tradition. Not all Pokemon can be accessed right off the bat, however, as some legendaries will only be catchable after the main story arc, and some Pokemon are exclusive to one of the two games (there will be ways to get them in the other game, don't worry!). 

The game follows a young hero of Nyasa Town as he fights against a terrorist organization to avenge his home and save the world. The game takes place in the Vesryn region, as well as the third section of the Pokemon League (following Gyms and Elite 4). A very interesting location is also accessible only from the Vesryn Spear.

A sample trainer's team for a medieval gym:

---Sir Charles---

Dragonair (A dragon

Kabutops (Swordsman)

Bisharp (Another swordsman)

Escavlier (Knight)

Obviously

I also thought a food gym or something could be fun.

---Chef Gustav---

Vanillish (Ice Cream)

Chansey (Eggs)

Paras (Mushrooms)

Miltank (Milk/Beef)

Farfetch'd (Leek)

This way, it could be more challenging because you couldn't just catch one Pokemon with a type advantage and cruise through to the Champion. What do people think?

-please keep in mind, it's ok if you hate them, but keep in mind I'm just another human being, so no need to hate on me, there's always a nice and productive way to express criticism :)-


**IV's/EV's:**

I would love an easy way to see ivs and a chance to train individual ivs, with an extreme time consuming technique, get a 'perfect' pokemon, but not through pure luck.

My perfect solution for this would be, and just drop the ivs and evs completely. Therefore one could chose one stat per level to be optimized, the lower the level you obtained your pokemon, the more training you can put into them, the more potential growth they have(maybe start at lvl 5, so you could get an optimal pokemon by breeding and raising it all by yourself) IMO hard training should be more important than pure luck when obtaining good ivs.


**Starters:**

 I would love having more than 3 starters to chose from, 3 stage pokemon. (Maybe you could, at the start chose between 3 or so sets of starters that you and your rival then choose from, maybe a normal set(fire, water, grass) a set of weaker pokemon and one with other typing(dark, fighting, that also would encourage replaying the game and would give you a more special connection to your starter IMO. 


**Trainer Skills/Professions:**

Being able to skill your trainer

Breeder(through breeding and hatching eggs), gardener(planting berries), cook(making some kind of poke food), coordinateur(in beauty contests or sth).

Then have like 5 lvls for every job

For the professor you could get a higher encounter rate for every lvl

Trainer could get the ability to rebattle others or have tougher trainers challenge him.
(All just quick examples to make a point and explain what I mean ;))


**Unique Pokemon:**

Differing sprites for a pokemon(maybe 3 or 5 or something), different patterns, this is actually sth I would love so much, it would make your pokemon so special and unique, heck I'd help make them if it was possible.


**Customization:**

Ability to somehow change your trainer(some customization?


**Optional Content:**

Some kind of contests/mini games that are optional


**Item Storage:**

 I'd like an item storage


**Pokeball customization:**

The ability to change the pokeball a pokemon was caught(or hatched)  in into another one


**Tm/hm:**
 
Have the reusable tm system implemented.
 hm should get extra slot, like the surfboard and stuff but a jet pack for fly is somewhat weir IMO maybe the ones that would result in weird items could still be done b pokemon(like fly) or there could be a pokemon with fly in every city or you could have a phone or instrument to call a pokemon that'd fly you somewhere.


**Plot:**

Maybe have the main plot lead up to lvl 90
Make it somewhat challenging, not only 2 pokemon for a gym trainer.
Some puzzles/tricky parts like the third gen had them with the golem trio


**Poke radar:**

Have something like the poke radar or any way to obtain shinies that doesn't totally suck and is horribly random


**Pokedex Completion:**

Give some reward for catching pokemon


**Trainer sprites:**

It would be amazing if other trainers would only use a sprite once


**Additional thoughts:**

- night/ day changes

- when pokemon is shiny

- rebattling trainers

- I don't know how hard this will be to implement for you

In my opinion

For example: Just as Nuzlocke Mode would be optional, hear me out. I have a few suggestions.

**Section 1: The AI**

Plain and simple, you know that something is wrong. I'm going to be starting out with the less ""game changing"" ideas first, and this is where I'd like to begin. If at all possible, please add some form of more intelligent AI. Don't make it possible to beat anyone easily. Have trainers intelligently switch Pokemon if they are at a type disadvantage. And for the love of Ho-oh, please don't let the Elite 4 have typing schemes. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Simple things such as intelligent item usage, switching out, or perhaps stronger trainers using a different Pokemon in their party first depending on what is first in your party. 

**Section 2: Their Party**

As I said earlier, and the elite four should NOT be type based. It makes it infinitely easier when the supposedly best of the best use one type. Seriously, what kind of old fool appoints these people? (Cough Professor Oak cough) Give the stronger trainers varied typing, and if it isn't asking too much, varied style of battle. Perhaps instead of assigning them a type, they could use Pokemon found throughout their local region, but in evolved forms. I.E, why isn't their main Pokemon a Flygon

**Section 3: The Stats**

This may well fall under party, and they would be correct. You very well could do that, but it wouldn't be difficult, it would just be tedious. And that's exactly what we don't want. In my opinion, the best way to correct this is to alter their stats. Perhaps a bit of the base stats, but I was thinking more along the lines of something else. The gym leaders/Story-line leaders/elite 4 are supposed to be the big guns, right? The best of the best? Then why is it that their Pokemon always have no specific natures, EV's, my possible suggestion for increasing the difficulty AND realistic-ness of this game is to have every major ""Boss""'s Poke's be fully EV

**Section 4: The Spoils of War**

What's the point, but how about we offer an extra incentive. Perhaps a slightly tweaked questline with an extra catch-able Fakemon, or legendary. My favorite idea to avoid anything unfair to people who aren't as good at battling as others is this: Alter the rate of shinies appearing on harder difficulties. You risk it all, you get the reward. Not by TOO much, but say you had 5 difficulties. For the sake of convenience, lets go with Very Easy, Easy, Hard, and on Very Hard, and should offer too much of an advantage in battle.

**TL;DR: Change the AI, and add in a reward(s).**

Nowadays my main source for that would be PokeCheck but I don't think that this will be compatible with that website so visible EV's and IV's would be really nice.

For EV trainers I was thinking maybe have a different ""daycare"" for each stat where you can leave your pokemon. When you leave your pokemon you can choose whether you want them to train your EV's or IV's. They would train around 0.25 EV's per step, but unlimited, item (something like red/blue/green shards). For IV training they could only train one IV per pokemon and for EV's they could only train 1 or 2 stats. Also if the your pokemon already has 510 Ev's they couldn't be EV trained in a daycare.

These would make it so that you can both easily keep track of EV training if you do it the old-fashioned way or you could leave your pokemon in a daycare for a day or two and get them back with one fully EV/IV trained stat.",self,t5_2wflg,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1e1ilc/visible_evivs_and_eviv_trainers/

a. The Pokemon also shouldn't be too strong compared to the others. Generally there's a Normal type that can also function as an HM slave if needed. A little later in the game

3. Put short distances between healing spots early on. As the player is building up their team

4. Early trainers generally should have simply stronger/more Pokemon that are already in the area

Ever since i first watched Voice of the Forest I've wanted a ball like this. One that allows you to capture and steal pokemon while unlocking their ""true power"". They could have a high catch rate (higher than ultra but not as good as a master) and whenever a pokemon is caught they would become a darker shade and start glowing gray. You could only catch pokemon that don't have enough willpower to break free (celebi, manaphy, most legendaries, etc. can't be caught like with a dark ball). Anyone caught with one should have the word 'Dark' before their name and have dark moves like Darkness Beam instead of hyper beam (still keeps the original type).

- Mightyena [direwolf / stark]
- Entei (or Arcanine but that looks closer to a dog IMHO) [lion / lannister]
- Dragonite [dragon / targaryen]
- Magikarp [trout / tully]
- Tentacruel [Kraken / greyjoy]

- Lilligant (or another flower pokemon) [rose / Tyrel]
- Staraptor (or Braviary as suggested) [eagle / arryn]
- Solrock [sun / martel]

1368577167.0,1ecmx6,ROM Hack?,asr1096,3,7,4,I was just wondering which original game this would be a hack of. I've been following this subreddit for a while and I don't think I've seen an answer. Thanks,t5_2wflg,True
1367416755.0,1dhbmm,A idea for the game. Just hear me out.,Agitatedleader,3,8,6,So this is a idea I kinda got from playing a lot of skyrim for the xbox recently. My idea is that in every single pokemon game that I have played (only went up to Diamond &amp; Pearl) that there is a evil pokemon organization. So my thought is that upon your first encounter with said group that they give you the chance to either join them or be against them. I feel like it could make the game a little more interesting.,t5_2wflg,True
1367374612.0,1dgewv,Pokemon Item Crafting,quazi_moto,3,8,0,"Hello everyone! So I have been following this subreddit pretty recently and started thinking what would spice up things like grinding to level up or going through wild grass with no repels. I was thinking at some point we could pick up an item like a ""craftsman collection."" After you get this item I was thinking after you defeat a wild pokemon there could be a random chance to get a ""component."" You could implement things like quests or obtainable blue prints with this. For example we could go to an area where you can find Hitmonchan's and after some luck you pick up a ""Hitmonchan's glove."" After getting a blueprint you can say combine it with ""grimer's goo"" and a ""qwilfish thorn"" to make an item called ""poison knuckles"" and gives all punch moves a small chance to poison. That is an example I made on the spot but having item quests and craftable items like that would be greatly appreciated if at all possible!",t5_2wflg,True

1367874741.0,1dtffh,I don't really care if you do or not just something that might be cool. MIGHT.,the-real-raybeam,2,10,5,Maybe you could splice Pokemon together to make even more Pokemon but not Pokemon of the same evolutionary line and maybe when splicing the two Pokemon for example Zubat+Diglet= Zulet but Diglet+Zubat=Digbat which is a different Pokemon and they evolve Goltrio and then Crotrio or Dugbat and then Dubatt I think it would be very hard to do but if you could and it isn't to hard please do it,t5_2wflg,True
