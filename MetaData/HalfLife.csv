You expect it to come soon.

Stage 2: You expect it to come at any major gaming event

Stage 3: I bet they're going to release it randomly

Stage 4: Google search Half-Life 3 every day. Filter by last 24 hours. Every day you see some bit of news saying that Half-Life 3 is around the corner. You savor every bit.

Stage 5: Theories. You see if you subtract Gabe's weight from pi you get 23562089650238695

People, and *think*.

Valve *is working on this game*. We're talking about one of

But we've ballooned the community's excitement for this game so much that anything less than super-human perfection will be enough to satisfy us. If there is a *single flaw* in this game, our community is going to hate it.

*Valve knows this*. And I think Valve is an even harsher critic of their work than we are. Valve has established itself as the type of company that will release a game *only* when it is perfect in their eyes

The level of desperation I see from people trying to find clues is genuinely saddening. I see users ripping apart glitches until it's nothing but a few lines of obfuscated code. I see posters claiming that Valve's employees are intentionally lying about the existence of an ARG. I think there are actually people out there who believe that Valve is letting people believe in the next Half-Life to keep them invested in Steam.

Now

Half-Life 3 *is coming*. Valve *is working on it*.  There was an entire floor (one of five) of Valve's office we *weren't even allowed to see*. 

Valve won't let us down

While this may sound cut-and-pasted, and what exactly I was putting Gordon's body through. The zombies are the same height as you, which may seem obvious, but actually is incredible to understand. I was facing a hulking abomination, not looking at a screen a few feet away. As for the game affecting me IRL, I had to crane my head upwards to climb a ladder, as opposed to just shifting my mouse forward and seeing the top. When I crouched to examine a dead headcrab, and every swing of the crowbar held **weight** in it.

It was incredible

https://twitter.com/SurgeonSim2013/status/350341471657926656

EDIT: This has just been discovered in the TF2 update in Surgeon Simulator:
http://imgur.com/4jHlNMB

All credit goes to u/armrha

You can see the little rings around Saturn. It's got to be the solar system
The korean is apparently 시간은 

 We had this tweet a few days ago from Steam: 

https://twitter.com/Steam_Support/status/349678346688405505
 The Korean there says 'Prepare for unforseen consequences'.

 Then HL2 was stuck in all the characters speaking Korean today

The claim is that these aren't ARG related but, it's starting to look extremely suspicious. There have been a lot of ideas as to what the text to fill in the blanks is, from SATURN TETHYS to a whole host of other stuff. What do you guys think? and the Surgeon Simulator 2013 guys have tweeted an acknowledgement of the puzzle.

Alex and Gordon Freeman are married. They are at Alex's dads funeral. Everyone is sad. But suddenly a zombie Alex's dad comes out of ground. He walks towards them and he doesn't attack. He has the  good head crab on his head...Lammar... and it brought him back to life. Dr Kleiners says Lammar hop into my hands but she dosen't want to come off. Then Dead Alexs dad calls other bad aliens....but they are actually good. He can talk head crab. So he gets a bunch of nice head crabs.They all then help them defeat the combine. Then 
slowly Gordon hears a rattle in the bush. He goes over to the bush and finds little black spirits that don't attack. Gordon then crawls forward to find this big circle bright yellow thing that shines and then blue around and then red around it. And then he found this button and when he pressed it zombies come out. Then when he put something into the yellow dot. He knew it could work to save Alex's dad. So he brings Alex's dad there and he put him right in the middle square and it made him alive again. And Lammar was still alive and hopped into the doctors hands.   The End.",self,t5_2rgym,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/18hnw8/my_5_year_olds_daughters_idea_for_half_life_3/

1331953551.0,r0crk,I might know what's on the Borealis? Hear me out!,Blue_ODaniel,99,14,39,"Okay

There are a lot of similarities to the Philadelphia Experiment. (Now to those who don't know what that is, it's a mathematical formula that proposes that gravity and electromagnetism are one and the same, and that it can be used to bend light around an object. (The Philadelphia Experiment.) 

Now, he immediately destroyed it, claiming that humanity was not ready for what it holds. Einstein died, and now the only person who was able to solve it was dead, and no one was able to solve it afterwords.  That's where I believe that Aperture and Black Mesa come into play.

We all know that both Aperture and Black Mesa competed for federal funding for their development for their portal devices. Black Mesa was strong in the scientist numbers, but they are seen in a picture with the Borealis, meaning they went to work for Aperture, betraying Black Mesa. with their knowledge of the super Portal that Black Mesa was developing, Aperture needed to find a retaliation to fight against Black Mesa in the race for the super Portal.

Now here's what I think might be on the Borealis.

First off

They're using the high amounts of energy from the Northern Lights to act as a super conductor

This also explains why Eli wants to destroy it

(I also have a sub theory that GLaDOS was developed to complete the Unified Field Theory, and the fact that GLaDOS' name is on the ownership certificate for the borealis, it might porve itself in further study, I'll get back to you on that.)


TL;DR

In the past, listen to what people have to say, and move on. I gave no appreciation for the AI for either the allies or enemies, and I didn't even bother to stop for the odd cache or two. But then, I found myself stopping everywhere I knew there was a cache, and paying more attention to how enemies reacted to my movements.

As I stated before, and actually got to work. I realized what I was doing as soon as I popped the door open and threw a grenade in to weed them out.

The Combine AI is a lot more advanced than I gave them credit for. When I play on a lower difficulty, they're the highly trained soldiers they're meant to be. I recall a post some months ago asking for advice for a mod to HL2, to increase Combine AI among other things, so they would flank you, throw grenades in your hiding spots, and other possible ways to squeeze every last bit of health out of you. But I notice they do exactly that.

I crawled down the hill staying low, but I was waiting with my Gravity Gun and a gas canister. With that house clear, I got all the ammo and health inside and went back out. From there, I crawled to the right wall of the shed and tossed a grenade towards the right house as a distraction. That got their attention. I whipped out my AR2 and fired away, then I got hit by a shotgun blast from my side. I hadn't even noticed they were getting around me. There, I switched to my shotgun and revolver, and the ones that got too close, and put a round into the head of anyone I could hit from further away.

Then it hit me. I was actually planning out my movements, shoot, live.
Run down the hill.
Think about the enemy positioning and how to approach them.
Shoot back.
Live through their flanking techniques and counterattacks.

A little further back, then an explosion went off in my face. They were weeding me out of my hiding space. I took off to hide behind a chest high wall. (I blame the Call of Duty SP campaigns that I played beforehand.) They flanked me on either side of the wall. I barely made it through THAT situation.

I really have a new appreciation for the game now. Looking for lambda caches (Especially now that I decided to turn up the game's graphics to max), has really given me a new outlook on enemy behavior and the character AI, as well as HL2's general atmosphere. I really should've done this the first time around.

tl;dr I bump up the game to hard difficulty and start going out of my way for caches and achievements and I realize that this 9 year old game is more beautiful than Dishonored and the ai isn't shit like BioShock Infinite's.",self,t5_2rgym,False,,blackmesa,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1cypqn/a_new_appreciation_for_hl2/

1363903462.0,1ardzj,Ultimate G-Man Theory,Mdisk64,95,17,27,"Other than being almost done with Sophomore year

www.blackmesasource.com/

I'm going to share my final verdict for the G-Man Mystery. 

NOTE: I've pondered this theory for many many years and there may be some holes. Please leave feedback 

So

G-Man delivers the crystal to Black Mesa, ""Prepare for unforeseen consequences."" The Xenannian creatures may have been pulled to Earth against their will, or maybe not, seeing as though they had an army ready. But how could they have known? Did G-Man and the Nihlanth plot this? Why would they be ready? It HAD to be pre-meditated.

Why would Xen help G-Man's obscure group? G-Man said THEY had control over Xen after the events of Half-Life 1. Did G-Man and his group DUPE Xen in order to gain the borderworld for the events of Half-Life 2? Or maybe he had other reasons for this. Like Xen being taken over

After that

While Freeman was in stasis for 20 years
The 7 hours war was not between Xen and Earth

G-man is using Gordon as his ""champion"" in overthrowing investors in his group. 

Look at it like this: A man (G-Man) has put something for auction online. Like a house (Earth). He is the landlord. He gets a real estate agent (Gordon) to sell the house to other people

But maybe Gordon is special. Why else would have such boundless energy? G-Man no doubt sees the danger in this and is ready at any time to overthrow GORDON if he ever tries to rebel against G-Man. Maybe that's what Eli was trying to warn him about before he was assassinated? Perhaps that's why G-Man locked Shephard in stasis as well. Seeing his potential in case Gordon was killed

Breen is totally aware that G-Man sold the Combine Earth, after investor. If that was true, Breen would have had Gordon killed a LONG time ago. Also, Breen's statement about Gordon being controlled backs up the fact that G-Man is forcing Gordon to be his champion. In retrospect, that is the equivalent of controlling him. But that's the only shaky part of this theory because HL3 has yet to have seen the light of day. 

Naturally
He either wants to have Gordon kill the combine so he can have the land all to himself, put a huge hole in his plans, and now wants Gordon dead, and Shephard to take his place. 

This alone can only be answered in Half-Life 3.

The Nihilanth wasn't a villian, Xen doesn't get conquered. Xen isn't conquered, no Combine. 

No Combine

No seven hours war

Famous last statements by the Nilihanth before he died:

""The last
""Win. You cannot win."" (Against him)
""Comes. Another"" (Tyrant)
""Deceive you. He will DECEIVE you."" (G-Man will kill Gordon when he doesn't need him anymore)
""You. Are. Man. He. Not. Man. For you he waits... For you..."" (self explanatory)
""Win. You cannot win..."" (any longer)

No, Ricochet's achievements are not new (see below). As for SS 2013, at the moment, we're out of clues on it. Valve has denied all ARGs. They're probably telling the truth...for now.** 

So, not necessarily directly say it, but it's enough. An explanation for Gabe Newell and Mark Laidlaw having no idea about the ARG is the fact that they may not be working on it (the ARG) at all. Note Valve's project system. Mark might just be writing for the story. He doesn't have any use in the ARG. This MIGHT explain the emails and whatnot that dismisses an ARG, but don't get your hopes up still. About Gabe's email. He may be faking us, or he may have no idea it's going on at all. Who knows? We have to give it the benefit of doubt.

**SURGEON SIMULATOR 2013 HAS A PUZZLE

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** I just got up and found out the Surgeon Simulator 2013 developers were screwing with us. The puzzle in Surgeon Simulator 2013 has nothing to do with a Half Life ARG. Although they very clearly mocked us about it,"" the exact same thing said by Steam Support. 

https://twitter.com/SurgeonSim2013/status/350549872459522048

https://twitter.com/SurgeonSim2013/status/350549872459522048

Refer to this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyS3-DvO7NT8eKLfCMPyAcXCpP1tSTLUX26bKjERqsk/edit?pli=1

-Note that all links between Surgeon Simulator 2013 and Half Life at this time have been disproved. See the twitter links and update above. Do note, it's most likely just the object they used for their puzzle. Remember, it's THEIR puzzle in THEIR game, so it's not Valve related at all. But the usage of Korean in their puzzle is obvious mockery. ^^^^^^get ^^^^^^the ^^^^^^pitch ^^^^^^forks

-It turns out the connection was Korea was just that many Valve games were released in Korea recently, as it's happening to plenty other games. Half Life 2 just coincidentally got a Korean language bug. There's also a Dota 2 tournament in Korea, the first of its kind, involving Nexon, a close partner of Valve. Do note anything Korean related is most likely not related to the ARG (if there is one) now.

-There was an unrecorded (in the update log) item (a claim check ticket) added to TF2

http://media.steampowered.com/apps/440/icons/claimcheck_large.a9647e42645c4e0bc2f0ce4eda3e44a8c8e74b77.png


-The connection to Korea is 

-Some players have reported their steam clients freezing up and playing the Tetris theme. Whether or not this is related to the puzzle/ARG is unknown. It seems to only happen in group chats.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1h836a/has_anyone_else_experienced_this_more_in_comments/?sort=confidence

-Ricochet is not a part of this. The achievements it has are called FinishedGame, according to Steam API. They were here since about [February](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1238036&amp;p=39760199&amp;viewfull=1#post39760199) and are most likely not involved in the ARG.

1362696062.0,19vh5l,Reasoned Prediction - Half-Life 3 exclusive launch title for Steam Box (also on Steam),PantuTheDog,77,19,34,"Ok, it's very reasonable to assume that Valve will release Half-Life 3 alongside the release of it's new Steam Box later this year.

Given that Gabe Newell is a very smart guy with excellent business sense, especially considering Valve as a company can't really afford to sell the box at a significant loss and plan to make up their profits 5 or 10 years down the line in the way Microsoft planned to when they launched the first XBOX.

I think Valve are also aware of the fact that the people who will be most interested in buying a Steam Box will be console gamers who like the idea of Steam and the games it sells but are unwilling to shell out significant $$$ for a high-end gaming PC to adequately run its games on.

So what is the one sure-fire way Valve could convince this demographic to pick up a Steam Box at launch before it has established itself in the console market (which it won't be able to do in the first place without enough early adopters?)... EXCLUSIVE TITLES.

Now, but indie games are hardly system sellers. They need exclusives which work well within the living room, and given the insane popularity and dominance of First Person Shooters in the living room it seems that the most secure way for them to encroach upon the competition would be to offer at least a couple of must-have FPS titles from day one.

They will also want to avoid having to pay third party developers to make their games exclusive to it's new system, Microsoft does. So what conclusion does this inevitably lead to? Valve needs at least one killer first-party FPS exclusive to launch alongside the Steam Box.

Given Gabe Newell's insistence on shrouding the development (or non-development!) of HL3 in complete secrecy - his recent comment to the BBC that 'when we have something to announce, and it seems inconceivable to me that given the popularity of the franchise and the long amount of time the company has had to develop the game it isn't somewhat far along in development, if not nearly finished in it's entirety.

If there's one thing which could guarantee the Steam Box is a hit

Anyway, given that Valve can't really afford for the Steam Box not to be an early success, and given that Gabe Newell is a highly intelligent businessman and knows that their home console has to be be an early success, I'm calling it...

**HALF LIFE 3

What do you think? I'd love to hear everybody else's views on the plausibility of my little theory wot I gone just typed out.



TL:DR - Valve needs a killer app to launch the Steam Box alongside

1337662574.0,tysp1,Thoughts on HL3,footlong24seven,64,13,73,"Obviously Valve is working in HL3 and not Episode 3. It doesn't take 5+ years for episodic content to come out

Many gamers complain about the wait for the game. After all, a few unconfirmed screenshots, and false rumors. Adding fuel to the fire, Valve recently announced that they won't be showcasing any new products at E3 2012. 

So why the wait? Rumors are abound with some kind of Steam console in the works (isn't that what a computer is?) or that Valve is waiting for the next generation of consoles. I honestly doubt both of these claims. Modern PCs with the latest graphics drivers can handle the game if it's going to be that demanding on a system. 

The more realistic reason, and Valve sure as hell knows it. Considering the industry standard bar they raised with HL2 and Portal, HL3 is going to have to raise the bar again. From Valve's perspective, HL3 must be a masterpiece for the ages, or else people will make a big stink and lose faith in the company's creativity.

Graphics aren't really the issue. TF2 has minimal graphics and millions of people play it. What's really the issue for Valve is how do you make a game better than HL2 and Portal? Quite a tall order. Essentially, and Portal introduced the Portal Gun. What new guns/mechanics can you conceive of that would be on par with these? A portal/gravity gun would be cheesy and make beating the game a walk through the park. 

Valve needs to figure out a new mechanic different from the portal gun and gravity gun (though the gravity gun may still be used in HL3). Otherwise

TL;DR : Valve knows the hype around HL3. They want to deliver with the best game that was ever created - anything less would fall short of expectations. Hardware must be taken into account

* To play as Gordon freeman throughout the entirety of the game with interactive cut-scenes.
* Alex to part ways with the player leaving you to adventure on alone. 
* An appearance from Adrienne Shepard.
* far Less gravity gun and more crowbar.
* Snow chapter
* scary as fuck chapter
* a return of some creatures from HL1
* Large interactive interments
* New engine
* A new game mechanic.

As far back as I can remember, I was there to experience it.

I can think of a time I was playing Super Mario Bros. 3 while my little brother Cody was watching. I handed him the second controller and showed him how to ""play"". Obviously I was still playing the game

I don't recall when I got a Super Nintendo. Those years went by fast, holy cow I lost my marbles. That was the coolest thing I had ever seen in my entire life. I was shooting stuff on the screen with a FRICKIN BAZOOKA. Mother of GOD this was awesome.

We zoom ahead into the days where I got my Game Gear. I had it all, the extra battery pack, and all the sonic I could handle. I think that machine ate more AA batteries than anything else I've ever used. I think that was the time I also watched more Power Rangers than was healthy.

Fast forward a few years to Christmas one year at my grandparents house in New Mexico. I opened up my larger present to find a box with the words ""Nintendo 64"" staring me in the face. I couldn't believe it, Banjo Kazooie, Extreme G, Super Mario 64, and Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. At this point Cody got better at Golden Eye than I did.

A few years later Sony laid a fantastic video game system on me, Twisted Metal, Final Fantasy VII, Tomb Raider, Blasto, Metal Gear Solid... It went on and on. I remember playing a game called Medievil with my stepdad Roger. I watched him play while he convinced me to eat my first grapefruit with a spoon. I covered the top with sugar and dug out the juicy meat, delicious!
Going into my teenager years

I got my first job

Unreal Tournament happened. At this point the family had replaced the other computer, I was so happy with myself.

This was a breaking point for me, and many others. Then I found a game in a pile of stuff that was on sale, Half Life. Installed the game to find a storyline, NPC's that interacted with you, extremely detailed graphics, and voiceovers. I put this on my mental checklist of favorites.

Santa brought our Playstation 2 for Christmas one year. I don't think I ever stared at a screen more closely. Seeing all the detail in Spy Hunter

Slowly, and moved on to another one. Years pass, my tech experience got better, and so my PC got upgrades. I started subscribing to game magazines. They were all talking about one game, Half Life 2.

I remember this game changed my opinion of what a good game was . This game was gorgeous. It made my PS2 jealous, the amount of weapons was staggering, and the voice acting was amazing. It felt like I was IN a movie, like I WAS the main character. Things were happening to the characters in the game that made me feel sad. Then the game ended on a note I didn't enjoy. I didn't know what was going to happen.

I started following the development of valve's creations. HL2 multi-player came out, installed the game and thought it was a sequel. Oh boy, was I wrong. The only thing this game did for me was make me angry. Not only did I not have answers to the looming questions about the storyline, I was teased into thinking it was the actual sequel.

I realized I had become attached. I wanted to cry I was so frustrated. Then The Orange Box came out. Wow, people died, and I genuinely felt sorry for some of them. Gabe Newell and team at Valve had done a fantastic job of creating something that felt real. Something I wanted to hold onto, like it felt special to me. Team Fortress 2 became a big part of my coping process, then the waiting began.

Almost 6 years later that brings us to today, and still no Half Life sequel. Fans have picketed on Valve's doorstep to no avail. A steam group called ""A Call for Communication"" attempted to get Valve's attention by getting over 28,000 gamers to all play Half Life 2 at once, and still nothing.

Valve, information about the new source engine, or something.  We just don't want to be waiting for all these years in vain.

TL:DR Don't leave us hanging Gabe.

So I put the question to you guys: Where do you want, the very first thing we see in the very first scene when we'll begin a new game?

Will we begin with another Gman monolouge? Will we see the inside of a helicopter sitting across from Barney and Alyx on our way to the Borealis ? Will we wake up in a cold cell in a Combine prison

Again

Firstly

Of course you do. These two are the epitome of hoplessness in the begining of Half Life 2

They show up a few times later

Now, so the Humans of Earth are now able to reproduce again. (I think you see where I'm going with this now). 

I'm going to guess HL3 will begin a significant amount of after Episode 2 ended, because they'll know the fans are probably over the shock after 6+ years.

But how long would be the right time be to allow for such a thing to happen while still allowing characters to be somewhat mournful? I'd say about a year

So here's what I REALLY want to see in Episode 3. These two: http://sectorw.wikia.com/wiki/Consoling_Couple in a hosital room where the woman is about to give birth. (Gordon would be present just because I guess. Hell

Anyways

Of course, and there'll be plenty of other ideas. So what do you guys think then? How do you want VALVe to handle the moment where they invite us back into the amazing world they've created?",,False,self,t5_2rgym,False,elite,

* The game is now set in China/colder parts of Russia.

*  The Combine have used the Borealis however not as they expected bringing Portal storms. (which means more Xen creatures)

* The game sees you and Alyx push the resistance to the Borealis  where the combine are centred.

* They make it however go to the Combine world (Xen maybe on the way)

Also, this includes Alyx and Gordon settling down, as Eli had joked about previously. So, Alyx gives birth... only to have the G-Man intervene and take their child with him, to another moment in time, somewhere in the past. He places the child under the care of foster parents who are employed at a research facility, awaiting the day where the child will at last be of use to the G-Man and his employers. Possibly placing the child in a position that tests its abilities before requiring use of its talents.

The facility? Aperture Science. The child's name? Chell.

The reasoning? The connection between Aperture Science and Black Mesa being competitors

Also, is it not possible that he'd also sabotage Aperture Science to then test Chell? You know, by compromising GLaDOS's artificial intelligence and morality, causing GLaDOS to initially release the neurotoxin that killed almost everyone inside of the complex? Maybe Doug Rattmann was Aperture Science's own version of Gordon, chosen by the G-Man as a sort of anti-Freeman (even their names are similar), but his emotions got the better of him and he failed, only to have Chell succeed.

Even GLaDOS taunts Chell about her past and her ""dead"" parents abandoning her throughout the testing facility... perhaps she is somewhat aware of Chell's history. Perhaps a part of the G-Man's subconscious and personality was implanted into GLaDOS's artificial intelligence alongside Caroline's?

A 'synth' is a creature created by the Combine, half machine. These creatures where all alien species from different worlds which the Combine had invaded, and taken over. These poor creatures where taken into synth factories and surgically made into war machines. There is also a theory that states the Combine have found ways to breed or clone synths to make large armies effortlessly. Read more on the wiki (http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Synth).

Synths are also known not to be their original shape (when they were non-synthetic organisms). This would mean that the Vortugor could have easily been made into what we know as a Crab Synth. Their 4 legs legs could have been merged to make 2 large, visible here: http://i.imgur.com/ua5XF.jpg The Vortigore is the one from the upcoming HL:OF mod, Operation Black Mesa (http://www.moddb.com/mods/operation-black-mesa), because it looks far better than the 1998 HL:OF model, but is the same thing.

You may say that anything could then be made into a synth, like adding armour and weapons, not completely converting the look of the creature (would take too long and be pointless, easier to make robots).

Now, which could be worked on later *caugh* HL3 *caugh* Maybe the Combine could have had some interactions with Race X, after all they did come through the portal like the Xenians.

Let me begin by saying this is just my speculation. I am certain valve did not think of any of this for Gordon and the actual reasons Gordon is the way he is all is due to being more of a blank slate for the player to fill. Now for my explanation. I know it sounds weird just allow me to elaborate and it will make more sense. 

Gordon Freeman's intelligence, possibly a savant. What we know about Gordon Freeman from 1 and 2 are the several facts: 27 year old MIT grad with a PHD in theoretical physics, above average athletics for a scientist (although this could be attributed to the HEV suit), physical appearance is only cleaned rather than personally adjusted (this can be debated earlier models of freeman gave him quite the beard and ponytail and if you count BMS he had a ponytail he cut off most likely because a higher up told him to), outstanding marksmanship for a non military trained civilian (again HEV suit *could* be credited to this). This is what we know about Gordon and these features do fall under some aspects to high functioning autism.

Now before I go further with this explanation I should really address the subject of autism a little further to both address the often misunderstood facts of autism and further establish the differences between autism

Wikipedia sums up autism as *""...a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication

So I said Gordon Freeman is what I classified as a High Functioning autistic, having noticeable ""different"" behavior. AS differs from other forms of autism mainly because linguistics are not impaired, typically however while this social impairment can be very crippling, Autism in all of its forms quite often has a practical upshot. I mentioned before how autism in a sense rewires the brain. So while the individual may be handicapped and socially ""blind"", an autistic individual can often ""see"" something in a way others cannot. 

At this point I must stress this does not mean that anyone diagnosed with autism is an untapped super genius, these interests can be made into a career in certain cases. For high functioning Autistics, this is more often achievable. To further clarify, just like any ""average"" individual, those I classified above achieve their career through a honed, practiced, and long obsessed skill. In rare cases there are Savants.

Savants are the ""gifted"" ones often glorified in films. The Rain Man of an uncanny level of bottled perfection of a certain activity or skill. they do not have to put great effort into something to achieve it. [In some cases they just do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8YXZTlwTAU)

Now that I have established a few terms I will point my perspective of Gordon. Gordon in my mind grew up a high functioning autistic and from an early age gravitated to Mathematics which lead to numbers, he achieved his MIT PHD and eventually gets the government job at Black Mesa. Gordon is smarter than the average scientists there, more physically capable too, so higher ups can overlook or simply not care if he isn't the social type and doesn't talk, he is doing the work and very well at that. And if that ponytail of his grows too long we will give him a talking, guess he just needs someone to order him to. The most he will do is give you a look and then reluctantly comply. He knows it will just get in the way of that hazard suit anyway. 

After the residence cascade Gordon discovers he is quite good with firearms

**EDIT:** A lot of people think I am saying Gordon can not speak at all. Please let me clarify this a little bit more. Gordon would not be mute being high functioning autistic. Simply socially inept or more likely socially declined. He can speak if pressed to do so but his silence is for either the case of analytical observation,,False,self,t5_2rgym,1359557793.0,,True

If this has sparked any ideas in anyone, I'll stick to my original plan and say that if Half-Life 3 comes out at 8:47 AM New Mexico time (GMT - 7 I think, so about five hours from now);

It was all right at the beginning

Then after a while we made it to a parking lot with a bunch of antlion burrows. I did one stupid thing there: ran forwards (more upwards

I made it — dunno how, and ~10 hp left (not to mention how many times  I loaded the previous savefile). Yeah, could go down and block the burrows — but no, too lazy for that. And who takes the easy path anyway.

Zombines were yet another source of PITA. A heavy dumbass with an armed grenade — gosh

It's a game cut above the rest in so many ways. The different environments, as if I WERE Gordon Freeman.

What I didn't like about HL2: the plot, the game literally tired me, physically, which is surprising. I didn't get a nice ""three-act"" feel from it, which I got from other games like The Darkness and most Halos. Re: checkpoints, autosaves were few and far between, requiring lots of manual saves so I wouldn't lose progress. Not a big deal but annoying for sure.

Still

**Episode 1**

Yes, but I got through the first chapter and soon I had my weapons again.

Getting the crowbar back actually got me teary. That's an insane achievement for an FPS. I emoted loudly

Graphics got a nice bump in EP1. Everything looks sharper and more detailed. Lighting was improved as well -- it definitely felt more natural. I'm still amazed at what Source can achieve.

In short, ever) prepare to be amazed.

A question remains

**Update 1: halfway through Episode 2**

So I started playing Episode 2. Just got past the Combine Cannon area

My thoughts: I'm torn between EP1 and EP2. I think that cave sequence in the beginning was way too long. It dragged so bad I would have stopped playing right there if this was not a Half-Life game. Once you're out of the cave

I wonder if I feel like that because of Halo. I like the open-world feel of EP2 but Valve keeps putting the player in dark environments. Or places with a ton of toxic waste. The reason I liked EP1 so much is that City 17 feels REAL. Traversing those buildings, it's all about going underground, dealing with toxic waste, etc.

Highlights so far: running away from the Guardian

I LOVE how the Vorts are written. It cracks me up every time I hear ""The Freeman."" They have a calming effect on the game

I think EP2 really gets into high-gear right before the bridge -- and using the car to jump over broken segments. Suddenly the games makes a 180 (sorry about the car metaphors

It was fun to meet the Hunters for the first time. My favorite strategy to deal with them is running them over with the car. So satisfying. I also enjoyed the whole Advisor introduction tremendously

Finally, which was fun in itself. 

(when the car broke down

I also kept missing the damn helicopter. I would either shoot too high or too low, having to avoid getting blown to bits while dealing with Combine soldiers and those sneaky zombies.

TL;DR: right now

**Update 2: Episode 2 completed**

Finished the game Friday night. I knew Eli was going to die and yet

The fact that I'm still thinking about it shows how *engaged* I was throughout Episode 2. After completing the game, it's better than Episode 1. I just had to get through those stupid caves and get to the car for things to GREATLY improve :)

From the Combine Cannon to the very end of the game, emotional distress and all.

My conclusion: Half-Life 2 plus Episodes 1 and 2 might be the best gaming combo of all time. The mythology is deep,False,self,t5_2rgym,True,,,t3_p52ix

The tone that Half Life 2 conveys is more about resistance (lambda symbols and resistance movement groups) rather than continuing the story right where it left off. Most enemies were Combine variants.

Later I posted a video [this video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJJkh5T3w-k&amp;feature=youtu.be] that gave you all a video representation of my theory.

Today I'm here with real-world proof that my theory might work.

As stated, the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights. 
Below is something that has been recently added to Wikipedia  under the Aurora Borealis page

""The aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history,000 miles (201,000 km) of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Traveler:
Boston operator (to Portland operator): ""Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes.""
Portland operator: ""Will do so. It is now disconnected.""
Boston: ""Mine is disconnected
Portland: ""Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually.""
Boston: ""My current is very strong at times, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.""
Portland: ""Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?""
Boston: ""Yes. Go ahead.""

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora
The effect of the Aurora on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, no fluid is discoverable in them . The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.""

After reflecting on this, he has gained the attention of outside forces whose interferences could prove troublesome. Adrian Shepard, on the other hand, is universally unknown by anyone who may oppose the G-Man's goals, as he was just another one of the faceless Marines sent to deal with the Black Mesa incident. Shepard has proved he can overcome any obstacle set in front of him just as Gordan has, but he could do it without the outside influences.
