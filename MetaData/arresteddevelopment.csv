In S01E10 ""Pier Pressure"" Buster is pulling out his Medical Marijuana binder from what we can assume are binders related to other 'Studies' that Buster has taken part in

""**HEMISPHERECTOMY SURGERY**""

A hemispherectomy is a very rare surgical procedure where one cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is removed or disabled. 

Might this explain a lot about why Buster as an adult is still needing constant supervision.... among other things...


* [""may suffer problems with their vision as well.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherectomy)

* [""Feeling tired or depressed.""](http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/functional-hemispherectomy?page=2)

* [""...you lose use of the hand opposite of the hemisphere that was removed.""](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-when-half-brain-better-than-whole)

* **Q:** ""What Risks Are Associated With a Functional Hemispherectomy?

* **A:** [""Delayed development.""](http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/functional-hemispherectomy?page=2)

To our friends, detractors, haters, enemies, and arch enemies.

I'm writing on behalf of everyone who has worked so hard to bring back a show that's very special to us; to say thank you for your ardent support of this show with the exception of the haters

We are all so grateful for another chance to bring these characters to life and could not have dones so without your consistent effort to ""spread the word"" about it. Although obviously in the case of the enemies the words you spread were ""don't watch this show."" You know I probably shouldn't have even included them in the salutation - but I""m writing this in ink and making all sorts of mistakes. Did you notice the 's' at the end of the word ""done""? What's that doing there?

Anyway

Except

And you really should watch them all - because they build and I'm just saying ""eventually"" if you can

But really this is yours now. Except for the obvious copyright issues and you have to subscribe to Netflix. So it's not completely yours I guess. 

I'm not going to write in ink anymore. 

I ~~love~~ don't know you

-----------------------------------------------------------


I did as much as I could to make these feel like real episodes. I made sure to separate the episode by storylines, and also the ""on the next Arrested Development"" as well as the credits (although the credits for episodes 1-11 are just a repeat of S04E01's credits).

I edited the narration to try to feel more natural when transitioning between scenes from different episodes. Sometimes I would cut narration or do a partial cut of it to make things feel nicer. For large scenes with multiple perspectives I would make sure to not have any duplicate things happening in the background, most other scenes were linear enough to easily be edited. I tried to keep as much original editing as possible, unless chronology required a split. The music does occasionally sound weird between edits, but for the most part I think the edits, and the episodes themselves, work pretty good for what I had to work with. I can't 100% guarantee the accuracy of my ordering, but I feel like I did a pretty good job.  I did allow occasional slight backtracking, but it doesn't affect the chronology very much.

Check out my episodes and let me know what you think in the comments here.

The truth was John was a caring newscaster that reported the news seriously and with integrity. Because of disputes with the producers of the newshow

John Beard's return to AD for this fourth season is his return to TV for the first time since KTTV let him go all those years ago. It's awesome that Season 4 directly parodies those crappy news shows (Like Good Day LA, and how shitty conventional TV ""news"" shows have become.

So, and how much Fox SUCKS for just dumbing down the ""news"" for the masses.

I never watched AD in its original run

And honestly if Fox had decided to bring back AD, even I like so many other people, were somewhat disappointed in episodes ~1-3. I probably would've lost interest waiting **three weeks** to keep watching more. But after you get past all the ""set-ups"" in episodes 1-3, it becomes AD again. It's incredible.
