I went through many different hospitals and doctors visits meanwhile missing over 3 months of my senior year of high school. I was seriously depressed as I watched those who I consider frends never show up or ask how I was doing. I wouldn't eat and couldn't move because I was in serious pain. 

My stepdad had recently gotten Netflix on our Wii and my boyfriend was visiting after work. He was flipping through the kids version to cheer me up and happened upon Avatar. ""I remember this show! I used to run around pretending to be an earthbender and throw rocks at my brother!""

I hadn't seen the show since I was a kid and just kind of went along with it but over the next 2 weeks it became like a rock for me (no pun intended). I took away so many more things from the show than I had as a kid and it restored my hope. 

I'm healthy now but I will never forget this show or my favorite quote  in the world:
