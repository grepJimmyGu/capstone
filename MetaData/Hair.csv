- mix a half an avacado, and olive oil (not overnight smells terrible in the morning)
- vitamin b
- massage your scalp a lot helps blood flow which helps hair growth
- brush it upside down just as long ad you can get the natural oils from your scalp and roots to the ends.
- don't brush or comb it when it's wet
- don't cut it
- if you really want
- DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENTS
- don't be really rough when towel drying
- don't sleep with your hair loose. Braid it put it in a ponytail or something to reduce breakage (re recommend two braids on either side)

Please feel free to ask question. 
No I do not work at a salon or anything bit have been cutting and dying my own hair since 6th grade I am now a senior in high school.

While I did get some help to cover the costs of his initial appointment with the vets, I am not going to get given that money for nothing - So I am selling my hair! I do not keep any electronics (the computer I'm using is my friends and I go between the library, too) so this is really my last option to help my little guy. We are in need of around £500 but I know my hair will not go for that so the asking price is £350 or offers.

LISTING DESCRIPTION:

FOR SALE:

10-12'' of thick virgin hair in dark brown.
I have been trying to grow my hair out for the past 2 years and so have avoided heat appliances at all costs meaning my hair is in top condition.

Washed every 3-4 days.

Never dyed.

Slight red tinge in the light with faint but natural ombre ends. Gradually fades into a lighter brown which is more noticeable in sunlight.

Hair will be cut by professional hairdresser and sent 1st class recorded.

Please email me if you have any questions.

Selling to fund cats veterinary treatment.

SERIOUS OFFERS ONLY.

Here's my predicament in short (pun intended). I currently have a pretty short pixie cut.

My questions are: 

1. How realistic is it to assume that in 3 months my hair could get long enough to be able to put up? 

2. Are hair extensions an acceptable alternative? Can you do temporary (clip on) extensions with a pixie

3. If extensions aren't doable

[LET MY JUST STATE HERE: I hadn't dyed my hair in over a year prior to going red so my hair was very healthy starting out. I managed to keep it that way by doing deep conditioning treatments between processes.

Anyway

First, as well.  I left it on for about forty five minutes and it made my roots ultra yellow blonde and the rest of my hair a red-orange color. 

The next morning

When that was finished

This is how my hair looked after: 

http://i.imgur.com/qBDlYEo.jpg

Still pretty orange, was use toner.

I bought Wella Color Charm Toner in T14 (pale ash blonde) and mixed it with 30 developer. I left that on for fifteen to twenty minutes before hopping in the shower. I scrubbed my head with John Frieda Frizz Ease shampoo before letting my hair soak in an Ion conditioning cream for about five or ten minutes.

Surprisingly

This is my end result:

I just wanted to introduce you to our lovely subreddit /r/skincareaddiction. We've only been around for a year but have grown tremendously since we began. We love to talk about all things skincare - moisturizers, hand creams... and the list goes on.

We're more scientifically minded than some other subs and so you can be assured that most of the advice that you receive will be based on evidence beyond just personal experiences.

We've recently started a new tradition of monthly group testing. It's not as scary as it sounds: all we do is let the community pick 2 products that they'd like to test each month

It would be great to have some more hair minded folks over at our place. Personally I'd love to talk shampoos

I've never dyed my hair, but I managed to grab the individual hair and get a better look, and it's definitely a different color.  It's about 3-4 inches long, and the very tip of it is my normal brown color.  The rest is a (very beautiful) golden red color.  I know sun can lighten hair color, but I don't spend much time in the sun at all, and that hasn't changed recently.  Furthermore, it's only ONE hair, like I said

I'm 21 right now.  I've been using the same shampoo for years (V05).  I use shampoo only every few days.  I let my hair air dry, I've started growing it out because I wanted to have a little fun braiding it.  It's naturally kind of curly.  No tight curls or anything, but  it can be pretty curly on days.

He tried filling my hair with rollers/ curlers, half of it hanging out. I was horrified, but I'm the sort of person who won't speak up.

I eventually had to push his shaking hands away

When *I* had finally done what I could to save my hair (not much), and called the best person to help in this situation: Mum.

However the past few months it seems to have become a lot worse and thick and has spread along to the sides of my head also (like approx. a few inches above my ears). It's itchy and I'm able to pulls/scratch off fairly thick chunks of what I'm assuming is dead/dried skin.

Is there any tips I can get for getting rid of this? I've tried using head and shoulders but that doesn't seem to do much. It's never been this bad before

I almost never style it with heat. However, so I was surprised it didn't take. Now I'm left with an even more uneven texture than what I started with along with the damage. 

Since then, and during my last trip to the hair aisle I found Organix and picked up the keratin oil conditioner and the moroccan argan oil conditioners, which I like a lot. I also picked up some Joico K-Pak recently after having it reccommended to me several times during haircuts. I've been using it mostly as a leave-in conditioner on my ends, but I did use it to deep-condition twice. That seems to be helping the damage. While I used to be able to do absolutely nothing to it, it no longer looks decent unless I take the time to put it in a braid to give it uniformity and keep it from tangling and getting frizzy. I've really been thinking about cutting it short, but the hair that would remain would actually be where the perm did take, which is mostly on the right side of my head and I think a patch in the back. I seem to be able to camouflage it with long hair.

I've had long hair my entire life. The shortest it's ever been is at my shoulders and even then I don't know what to do with it. Other girls I know with long hair are always styling it differently, blow dry it, and go. To me, styling my hair means straightening it so it looks a little under control. Very rarely do I ever do that though as it takes almost an hour to dry and an extra hour to make sure its all straight and even. I hate wasting that much time every day on something that doesn't even matter to me, and at the end of the day it always looks just as bad as it did before I got into the shower in the first place. I've been thinking about shaving my head for a few months now.

So right now my hair is basically long and straight and has a natural ombre thing going on (which I think is cool).  I want to do something different as far as cut or style because it has been like this for a while

I farm for a living.  So

I also greatly enjoy the length because out of all the lengths (from pixie cut to long) both myself and my husband prefer my long hair.  I feel both like I can do more with it and like it is sexier on me.  

I also really enjoy that it has naturally done this ombre thing because of being in the sun as much as I am.  My hair, it has flattened my hair to color it, so I'd be very hesitant to color it again.  

So the question is what subtle change can I make in cut or how I wear it to give it a new look without taking away what I love?  I would be open to perhaps putting peroxide or lemon juice in the bottom to bring out more of the blond.  Any suggestions are welcome

My hair seems to be pretty healthy.  I use sulfate and paraben free shampoos and conditioners.  I use apple cider vinegar every few weeks to clarify.

 (sorry for the creep-face

I hate that even with product in my hair, the worse it gets. Thus, I've been noticing some hair styles in films set in the 20s to 40s that I'm starting to think I could pull off. 

Examples:

I like the idea of just buzzing the sides off and being able to wear my hair back for a classy look or pushing it to the back/side for more casual situations. 

My concerns:

1: is this look going to look weird because it is so dated (to the prohibition era

2: will it look strange if I wear a beard with this cut? 

3: how will it grow out/what's the upkeep on a hairstyle like this?

My question is basically in the title. I've read a few different opinions on this but generally speaking:

- What is the ideal amount to use? Coin size or heaps?
- Is it best applied to dry hair? Or as a conditioner after shampooing?
- How long do I leave it on for? Most sources I've read say 30-60 minutes..

OK, everyday people pull it off? I’ve seen a few girls around Charlotte sporting the freshly shaved comb over. There is a bartender who works at a few of the popular bars, who pulls it off nicely. I decided to write this today, after being asked to have it done to myself. After spending an hour on Google looking at all the girls who have taken that jump, and obviously have a large set of cajones! I also posted a photo on Facebook, and asked the advice of my peers. Even though only one person said yes, I’ve decided to go ahead and do it! They should know better than to tell me no 

Now, look how cute these girls look, it’s somewhat sexy. It’s definitely daring. I’ve been contemplating a crazy change, either an obnoxious hair color, since I’ve already chopped it off in a funky asymmetrical cut. Now, here I am going to shave the side YIKES!! Carmen Electra just took the leap, I mean if she can do it… I can too! So, right? It will grow back!  I think it’s funny, I have always noticed the style however

I am one of those people that once you put an idea of a crazy hair style in my head

So, since it’s so new. Which I am OK  with. So, my natural hair color is so light we had to color the sub section. I agreed to let Logan bleach it, then cover with teal. She also colored the front piece purple. I am so excited, I am looking forward to doing the full section. I cannot wait to see how it looks styled!

 

So the cut is now done, I absolutely love it! I am actually having a friend who is a barber, carve designs in the shaved area. Now, who else is ready for a funky do?

First trip: I ended up with an all over color, also no red.  It was like a dark auburn color.  It was beautiful, but not what I wanted. 

Second trip one week later:  Bleached highlights and an all over demi color.  It was reddish and reddish orange.  It was actually kind of pretty.  But still not what I wanted. 

Third trip one week since the last:  The same thing - bleached more highlights and the same all over demi color.  I got so many compliments on my hair.  It was actually really unique looking.  Very red, it sounds like a mess but it wasn't.  It also wasn't what I wanted.  

Did some research and found the L'Oreal HiColor HiLights.  The dye contains a lightener (I think bleach) in it

I loved it

So about two months later after the color faded so much that the bleached parts of my hair turned pink and blonde

This is what my hair looks like now (several months later): http://imgur.com/QDjd1rE

The ends are very dry and very brittle.  My hair used to be very soft and easy to deal with.  Now, and it gets frizzier than usual.  It's also very thin and fine. I prefer having long hair, but I'm thinking I want to cut it pretty short to get rid of the dead ends.  However, since my face is so round, I'm wondering how it would look.  

Please, needs to be trimmed).  I've recently started using a cheap, oil treatment I found at a drug store.  It's helped a little.  But I'm just ready to chop it off.

I'm a little nervous about trying it out, what hairstyle would be best? Keep in mind that I'm about 5'3"" (160 cm) tall and I weigh around 105 pounds (48 kg), so my thin-as-a-stick frame might affect what would look good. Pictures would help, but really any suggestions would be appreciated!

Prom is coming up on May 10th and I wasn't originally going to do anything with my hair (far too lazy...) but was convinced to by some other people. I have fine hair but a lot of it, and it's really healthy (I don't color it, or use heat or products on it). The last time I got it cut was about two weeks ago when my friend had scissors and I let them have at it! I don't like using any kind of products, or using heat, but I'm willing to try. Mostly I just shampoo, conditioner, and towel/air dry.

I was thinking about [this](http://i.imgur.com/UutmQkI.jpg) sort of a style (even the hair I have now is almost too long for my liking)

So

-Does this make sense? How do I ask for this in a way that my stylist will give me what I want? Are there “terms’ to know or something?  I’m worried this is a weird request or won’t make sense so they will refuse to do it.

-Do any of you guys have anything similar?

-How do I find the right stylist and salon? I’m worried that it’s not normal so that stylist won’t have done it before

This is my hair now! In the first picture is it miraculously straight (I never heat style my hair)

Basically, so I finally grew it out. I used to dye my hair black frequently, then about two years ago I decided that I wanted my natural colour back, or slightly more red, and so I got the black out (using colour OOPS, no bleach!), and then dyed my hair an auburn shade. The only issue was that since my hair had varying levels of damage/porosity, you can see the aftermath in the second picture. 

I have had my hair more or less like this since I've started growing it out, and some long layers. I am itching for a big change again, and I have no idea what to do!
