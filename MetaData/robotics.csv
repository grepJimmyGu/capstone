There is still some software work to be done on the hexapod but things are looking good.

We would design a fairly simple/cheap project, sensing, A.I., perception, etc.). These design/build steps could either result in a complete robot, or the first few could result in a complete robot, with other steps adding modular components. I realize there are plenty of robot tutorials out there, most are either boring, using existing libraries vs. creating your own). Essentially

On a side note, in addition to having the subreddit be a forum for specific robotics questions, we could host a collaboration thread every week where we, in essence, conduct an informal, high level design review of an specific idea/design (e.g. two legged spider killing laser turret), and suggest more cost-effective, and simple additions/changes to the design. Through these, but to others as well. This sort of forum where a lot of knowledge is centralized is a very powerful resource. Feedback?

**EDIT:** The responses have been varied, as well as start developing/testing designs for build tutorials that draw from the guide. The guide could include beginner's sections, common problems, general hardware information, as well as delve into some more advanced theory. I envision it as a general framework that can easily be modified and expanded by different people; this would bring a lot more information into play than having a single person decide/create the content. I do not know if there is a good way to do this on reddit; I was thinking about having a link tree structure, the base of which could be easily accessible (e.g. sidebar), but I do not know how to do this. I would love it if other people took an interest in contributing as well

As some have pointed out, they really only let you design a robot in a certain way that can do certain things. Even the more general kits out there (e.g. Ardu-bot) do not leave you with a whole lot of room in the design department. I would like to really push robot customization with this effort, and enable people to look up a lot of information about how they could possibly do something.

In essence

* **Robotics Guide**: Create a robotics guide as described above
* **Educational Robot Design**: Come up with custom robot designs that exemplify certain facets of robotics (as described above) and build/document them. Some of these can be low-cost, could be more advanced, unique designs that show off some advanced robotics stuff, which may be more challenging to build. I think a suggestion/voting thread would be ideal for this. Maybe we could do one every quarter or something?
* **Design Suggestions**: Start a thread to suggest designs for people who are new to robotics. In essence, these should be more 'out there' and don't necessarily need to be designed to educate people about how to build robots.

my boyfriend has been somewhat depressed for some time due to various reasons. He loves technology and i remember seeing some of his old robots in the basement and that he took it in high school (hes 20yrs old).
ive been trying to think of ways to help him, one of them being a power transverter and various expensive adapters.

i know absolutely nothing about this, or find them for cheap?
any help would be appreciated greatly

here are my questions: 

1. Is there any comprehensive website that explain UAV build for a newbie? (I know there are couple websites that explains basic structures of a drone/uav but they are not that helpful)

2. how much budget do I need?

3. what brand do you recommend for drone or parts(and why)?

4. Is it possible to control multiple drones with single computer or controller?

5. What are the risks?

6. how difficult is building a drone?

[autonomous car video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrCWLSO1FBU)


The car is based on a 1/10 scale RC car.  For the localization I used GPS/gyroscope sensors and a Kalman filter.  I had originally built all the electronics on a breadboard but that was a bit of a disaster.  The car was always knocking things loose so I decided to try building a PCB shield for the microcontroller.  I had never done that before either and surprisingly the PCB worked too.  

I tried to keep track of the progress on my website

Now that the abstract time is over, then fiberglass, bondo, and paint it to create a strong replica of the 3D model. Here is my helmet so far: http://imgur.com/a/dd2P2#0 .

There are several ways to go about the eye holes. Some people have just left the holes, but none have done what was in the movie. Augmented Reality.

Augmented Reality is way too complex for me to care to learn. I don't necessarily want a complex HUD. But another concept, undetectable webcam on the helmet, and use a pair of Virtual Reality glasses, I could make the coolest Iron Man helmet ever. Of course I'd have the mask open with motors, which is why I posted this is r/robotics, so the helmet would be an almost exact replica.

One thing I did learn was that I need to take a course or two in probability and/or statistics, which I plan to pursue later this year.

My idea with this project, as well as to better develop the programming skills for robotics. Depending on how the system turns out (and whether funding is available), I might take it to the next level and move it from being based around a toy vehicle platform (currently a PowerWheels ride-on), to something more advanced (maybe a quad-cycle or another similar off-road vehicle).

I don't have a degree in engineering or anything, despite not having such a qualification, is there any hope for me turning my career towards this direction, or am I likely relegated to it always being a hobby? If there is some hope, what more should I be doing in this pursuit?",,False,t5_2qh0p,True

I've been poking around the internet, travel speed, and many other variables.  They can also determine if the parameters on the machine are set correctly (volts and wire speed/amperes) to achieve the best and most uniform result.

I simply wonder if a robotics engineer could team up with a welder and come up with a more adaptive system.  For example, with a weld size of 3/16""), draw a guideline for the robot to follow, the robot would adjust it's parameters, position itself, and with permission from the user, start welding

In the vid the robot is controlled by my iPhone using an app called OSCemote. OSCemote sends OSC (Open Sound Control) commands to my PC over wifi which is running a custom python OSC server. The python script then outputs commands to an XBee module in transparent serial mode connected via USB. 

The robot has an Arduino as it's main controller. It receives commands from the PC via an attached XBee node and controls the 2 servos to make the robot move.
