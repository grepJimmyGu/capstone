- The only way to get better

- Don't burn bridges. Even if theyre unfunny hacks. 

- Make friends. Network. This will open up new opportunities for you.

- Need 5 minutes of material? Write 10 minutes. Edit that down to 5. Add to it now. Make it 10 minutes again. Edit THAT down to 5. Now you should have a very tight 5 minutes. You just turned that coal into a diamond baby!

- People worry about hecklers too much. You dont get them often

- that being said you want to be likeable/relatable. This will let you get away with some jokes an unlikeable comic wouldnt. Also if you have a joke eat shit

- Don't steal jokes. You should know this.

- Be on time

- keep a notebook with you. jot down ideas you can come back to and form into jokes/premises later on. This makes life easier.

- when you feel more confident start hosting shows. This will help you get good fast.

- again

Write.
Edit.
Do mics.
Write.
Edit. 
Do more mics.
Dont be late. 
Dont run the light.
Dont make enemies
Make the crowd like you.

The first and easiest way to get booked is to have major credits. If you've been on Comedy Central, we're going to put you on the show. Even if the comic's connection to reddit is tangential, credits help draw a crowd. Without a crowd we don't have a show.

The second best way is to know me personally. This isn't just about putting friends on. If I've met you in person, there's a chance we still have mutual friends. If a comic I know and respect would recommend you, I'd definitely try to accommodate them. If they're famous enough, I don't even have to know them personally. If Marc Maron says ""put him on,"" I'm doing it.

(Incidentally

The third best way is to be active on reddit. If you're regularly contributing good discussion and content to /r/standup and /r/standupshots, I usually find them as terrible as everyone else).

Videos actually *aren't* a great way to get booked. Like most of you, I'm much more likely to check out their youtube channel - because I know they have some solid writing. That's how I found out about comics like Bill Squire and Josh Johnson.

Booking is a horrible process and there's no way to make everybody happy. I can't promise you'll get on. But in keeping with the educational theme of the subreddit,False,self,t5_2r18f,False,,,t3_1itp5o

--------------

Classic first gigs mistakes: 

Talking too fast. 
Getting pissed. 
Not staying in the light. 

Nerves: nerves are good. Embrace them. It can feel unpleasant before going on stage

Stand up straight on stage. 

Watch the pros. 

Start and end with great gags. 
At a gong type affair start with a bang. 
BTF audience seem like kittens
At a more brutal gong night

Surround yourself with good comedy. CD's books

It's often easier to perform to strangers rather than friends. Think carefully about packing the room with your mates. But at the end of the day

Believe in what you say. If you don't show that you think it's funny they won't believe it is either. Comedy is nothing without belief. It's all a con trick. Many 'great' acts have no jokes to speak of (Hicks, Rock etc. ). The audience don't seem too notice or mind. 

Watch the whole show. Learn from how others dealt with the same audience. 

Aim to write every day

Don't over-run. 

Never, ever apologise. Don't show weakness. Don't say you're not really a comedian, have a day job, aren't sure about this one etc. They want to believe you are the man. Let them. On stage you are the alpha male. 
(Easy advice to give. Hard to follow) 

If it's the sort of club where the audience dress up then wear a shirt

Important one this: DON'T CHURN YOUR MATERIAL TOO MUCH. 
A lot of new acts do a gig, keep the best stuf, replace the weakest with the best of your new material. I would say for a new act if you're changeing more than 10% of your material between gigs you're probably shooting yourself in the foot. As you go on that ratio drops. After a few years 1% is good. 

Re: sick material. Be careful
Sick stuff can be ace, injects energy into the room. If it isn't up to scratch all these factors go into reverse and you alienate them. That's why you see so many rubbish new acts try and be shocking and fail at it so badly. 'I fück kids' - do you? great! well done you. For most people sick stuff is best left till the second half of yours set by when they hopefully like you and have belief. Early on you may lack the skill to get over sick stuff. Ease into it. A bit at a time etc. 

Of course if your entire schtick is sickness then you have to just go for it. 
If you even dip your toe into these waters then watch Jim Jeffries first, do it. With attitude and belief. If they get arsey? plough on. Up the stakes. You lose some of the room? So what? the rest can more than make up for it. You die the odd spectular death? so what? 

'Do

(can you tell from the above bit that Rob pm'ed me some gags that were a bit dark?) 

When you die (it will happen)
What's the worst that can happen. Feel a bit of an idiot? someone tells you you're shït? who really cares? 
I lost count fo the amount of people who told me early on that I should give up

When it doesn't work

If it's not working

Every word you say on stage has a job to do. If it doesn't, edit, edit. 

'Experiment in good rooms

On a tough night you are so grateful for all your bankers. The killer gags that always work

Have regular punchlines. As a rule never go more than 15 seconds without a big laugh. The longer the lead up to the gag the better the pay off should be. If you're going to make them wait a minute or heaven forbid even two for the pay-off it had better be fücking great. 

Sometimes it's not working as it should. Assuming you're not in your first few minutes you might want to try and banter to re-engage their attention. Go into the audience, return to your stuff. Repeat as necessary. Maybe not for the newbie. In fact it's really hard full stop. 

Hecklers can do the above job for you of course. Succesfully dealing with a heckle can energise a set when you would otherwise be losing them. Dont' be afraid of heckles. When heckled: 

1) Consider whether you need to respond. If it's a big room

2) In a big room repeat the heckle before replying. Many of the audience won't have heard it. If you don't repeat it first they won't know why you are saying what you are saying. It also gives you time to think of a clever response. 
(easy advice to give, you think of something really clever, you blurt it out all pleased with yourself,90% of the audience don't get it because they didn't hear what your are responding to. damn) 

3) Ideally respond with something 'in the moment' it doesn't have to be great

4) Standard put-downs. At some point or another we all use these when our back is to the wall


Joke rules: 
1) Look for the 'reveal' - the key word that springs the trap of the joke's mis-direction. Put it at the end of the sentence. 90% of the time this increases the word's power and hence the jokes surprise and laughter. Occassionally it sounds too contrived to have it at the end but always try it there first. 

2) Jokes have internal rhythms that help them work. You have to play about with this and get a feel for it. Try it different ways and see what sounds right

I often insert a bridge into the middle of a line to help the rhythm. 
Set-upy
Seemingly unnecessary bridge. 
Punchey

Two popular ones (often used to disguise a weak punchline) are: 

Build, build, build, build. Drop! 

Quiety, quiety, quiety, Slam! 


3) Write the way you speak. 

4) If you've got two versions of a joke and suggests a visual image

5) cliches aid misdirection

6) If you can't write jokes

This started off as a newbie guide

One final thing then. All the advice you are given is people telling you what was right for them. It doesn't mean it is what is right for you. Choose wisely and follow your own path. Good luck. Don't forget to enjoy it

* What do people think? 
* Would anyone be interested in hosting/producing? I think it would be best if we had two co-hosts who shared hosting/booking responsibilities.
* We could tell people about this in the NYC meet up threads and potentially turn this into a monthly stand-up show / Reddit meet up in the East Village at a cool comedy space with a bar with cheap craft beers

1367748759.0,1dq577,My approach to writing and structuring my comedy routines - hope it helps some people,cheesenightmare,47,7,18,"Hi r/Standup - this is my first post here. 

I thought I'd throw in my contribution by sharing my writing technique which I've just settled on. So far is working great and I figure it might help some of you who were struggling with the process as i have been. I've struggled for some time not with writing per sé but with keeping my writing in an structured way that allows me to actually build on what I have. Here's my new approach...

I have 3 categories of joke blocks: One liners

One liners are self explanatory and at first they don't have any place in my routine. I can't remember 30 arbitrary one liners - so instead I consider them to be the first joke in a series of ""Quick 6's"". 

""Quick 6's"" are a series of one liners. Now, because i have memorised a block of them rather than a bunch of fragments.

""Subroutines"" are jokes I write that are several paragraphs long. They can have just come about that way or (more commonly) they are the natural evolution of a ""Quick 6"" block. 

I then build routines out of a combination of Quick 6's and Subroutines.

Id also like to add that to do this effectively i use an app called ""Scrivener"". This allows me to have a master list of all my jokes and draw from them to create ""collections"" which are essentially like playlists. That way if i tweak or amend my jokes as I create a fresh routine those changes are reflected in the master document.

Long term I intend to use the George Carlin/Louis CK approach of performing all my jokes in a festival show and then throwing everything out to make space for fresh material the following year.

It feels finally like I am working on something finite and tangible rather than ongoing and amorphous. That's a big deal for me. If it's not a big deal for you

Did the gig tonight and... Wow...just... Wow.

This is going to take some explaining.

The venue was a Sports Bar inside a Bowling Alley.  I arrived early to scope the place out and try to get a feel for the crowd.  Upon arrival I was informed by the 'booker' that part of the room had been reserved for a company Christmas Party

Looking around, 1 basketball shooting game, and 30 odd TVs lining the walls.  

The stage was a raised platform about a foot tall with a second section behind it backed by one of those banners you can get beer distributors to print for you. It was being held up by three wooden slats that were pretty well leaning in on each other for support. All of which was stuffed into a corner of the room.

The front row of seating

People trickled in over the course of the next half hour.  Most of them went to join the throng at the bar, we had MAYBE 150 people scattered throughout the room with 2/3 of them permanently at the bar.

Two of the other three comedians showed up about 20 minutes prior to show start with the third arriving about 10 minutes before his set started.  I was told I would be opening and I would have 10 minutes to fill.  Unfortunately

Show got started about 10 minutes late because the booker was trying to get people to come sit down

Except I didn't get very far.  The loud C&amp;W music that had been playing prior to the show continued to play.  The microphone hadn't been set up properly and so my volume had to compete with the musics volume to in order to even be heard.  Pool games continued

Even if I had material that could have killed, the booker started telling me I was running out of time.

Needless to say, but by and large I was bombing before I even got into things.

And then the second act came on stage.  Since he was more of a veteran than I, the TVs still running and all the people talking.  None of these were actually fixed until about half way through his 20 minutes but that's okay because as soon as it was, people started playing air hockey.  The remainder of his set was punctuated by the plink plink of people playing the game.  I watched a guy with 8 years of experience bring his A material and utterly waste it.  There were maybe three chuckles in his entire set.

The third act fared no better.  By now only a handful of people were even looking at the stage.  He tried for about a minute to get anyone to even respond to his crowd work or answer a couple simple questions and then abandoned his material and started riffing on the venue in general.  Nothing.  No interest, nothing.  If anything the people in the bar got louder so they could carry on conversations over him.

And then...  I swear this is true, no funny stuff at all, just ten minutes about how he is Jamaican, has one Jamaican kid and came from Jamaica.  I left for a smoke.

Then our headliner came up.  You can guess how that went.  A material

Tonight, not for myself, but for the guys who knew what they were doing and got a shitty venue with a shitty crowd and some seriously shitty treatment.  I don't know what that crowd was there for, but it certainly wasn't to see and enjoy some comedy.

At any rate, but part of me was scared tonight I'd break that streak, since it was the biggest crowd I'd played to.

Honestly it went really well. Somehow I was on autopilot as soon as I hit the stage. Never forgot a word or tripped up on a punchline. The crowd liked me and was interested and didn't heckle. I couldn't have had a better set at this stage in my comedy game. 

Afterwards

When I was asked to do this show, and guys who I think are honestly funnier than me. I was scared. I was nervous.

Highlights: featured 7 times, was a guest on a podcast [here](http://digressionsessions.com/robfarley/).

Lowlights: Three sets I considered a 1 out of 5,"" driving an hour and a half to perform in front of 9 audience members for free, bouts of depression and lack of confidence, drinking too much at a lot of bar shows (after my set is over).

**Things I've learned and consider to be true:**

-Try every room at least once. In general, I don't think you HAVE to keep doing every room and HAVE to expect to do great everywhere, all the time. A bluegrass band isn't going to go over well at a heavy metal bar. Just as not all music is the same, not all comedy and places to perform are the same. Sometimes it really isn't worth it, but be discerning when deciding where to cut your losses.

-Be nice to everyone to their face and also behind their back

-Close every good set with your Twitter handle (EDIT: /user/EmperorSexy points out that this is debatable

-Keep refining your shit

-Open mics are for new stuff

-Hosting is harder than it looks. I recommend listening to Cameron Esposito host on the Put Your Hands Together podcast and try to emulate the way she's so enthusiastic, and engaging with the audience. 

-With time

-If you're new

-Audio record your sets and listen back. If you start featuring maybe it's time to buy a camcorder and a tripod. I did

-Keep writing. If you get writer's block and are frustrated you can't think of anything new

-The best way to recover from a terrible set is to make sure the next one is good. Even if that means pulling out more old/safe stuff than you'd ideally like

-No one is ""unbombable"" and it happens.

-Don't stand up there looking like you're regurgitating pre-memorized shit

-If you have to do bringer shows

-Be relentless. In writing, in performing, in trying. Be relentless, and persevere.",,False,self,1370639218.0,t3_1fvuyt

Advertise the hell out of it to reduce the amount of people who stumble upon it. We had a good size crowd

Have a host who knows what he's doing. Ours look defeated and broken after the third comic. So much so that a random woman came up and just took the mic from him like ""hey...its ok....ill take it from here"" and then SHE hosted for the rest of the night. 

Have a house that supports the cause

So there's a very big name in comedy (one of those guys that most stand-ups idolize) coming to this relatively small town soon and the club he's going to be performing in is having a competition to open for him. The catch is that you have to pay to enter the competition. 

One, I'm not great friends with the club owners like some comics and the owners make up at least some of the judges (it's like a panel) so I feel like they'll choose someone else no matter what.

As the booker, it's almost impossible to recover. It's a lot harder to produce a new show, than get booked on one.

In order for a show to be successful, and not what's best for the crowd. Putting up a bunch of open micers is a quick way to ensure that a show will never be taken seriously. If there's no audience, there's no show And that means no stagetime for anybody.

Because the consequences of failure are so high, somebody who's been around for years, and the promises of someone I've never met - I'm going to go for the guy with evidence.

That doesn't mean that I only book my friends. I know most of the people I book

These are the things I consider when booking

* Your credits
* References from other comics
* Whether I owe you a favor
* Whether I need a favor from you
* How well I like you

Whether you're ""funny"" doesn't really matter to me. Every comic thinks they're among the best in the industry, the same things that keep you from being booked on my show, are keeping me from being booked on other shows. I'm playing by the same rules you are.

Not all of these factors come into play every time. Credits and references are the closest thing to determining if a comic is objectively funny. If you've done Fallin and Comedy Central, you're in a better position that the open micer who kisses my ass.

Ultimately, it increases the chances I will.

So if you don't know me, you probably don't. For the frustrated open micer, how can you move up if no one will give you a shot? If you're truly good enough, you'll figure it out. It might involve producing your own show, or being willing to do a ton of crappy ones. You'll have to network with hundreds of people, looking for a break. You can't control your luck, but you can control how long you try, the more experience you acquire. And the nicer you are,self,

**About the Shows**

/r/standup is the standup comedian subreddit - which shares moderators with /r/standupshots and /r/standupcomedy. To help promote standup comedy on reddit, and to provide reddit's comedy fans with the best comedians we can find - redditor or not.

**/r/standup NYC**

The NYC show, the free weekly show provides stagetime for travelling redditor comics from across the country, as well as special guests from Conan, Letterman, Fallon, Ferguson &amp; Comedy Central Presents. Redditors get a free show, travelling redditor comics get quality stagetime in a town where it's hard to find

**/r/standup LA**

The LA show is a more traditional big-budget club show. Hosted by the Hollywood Improv

Tickets for this show are $10, charges a 2-drink minimum in addition to the ticket price (alcoholic or non). Between tickets and drinks, redditors attending the show should expect to pay ~$20 per person. While this is more than many are used to paying for entertainment, it's significantly lower than the average price for a night at a NYC or LA comedy club. We regret not being able to offer this show for free, but doing so would require significant sacrifices to presentation and talent. Rent, stage, lights, security, and we'll always try to be as upfront as possible so there's no hidden costs.

If you're more interested in completely free comedy options in the LA area

**I'm a comic. How do I get booked on the show?**

Details on our booking criteria are available [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1itp5o/it_took_a_year_but_rstandups_nyc_show_is_now/).

Because of differences in format, we can take more chances with performers. That being said, the show isn't charity stagetime for any redditor who's ever gone to an open mic. But if you're a working comic with several years of experience, who's willing to do an unpaid 10-minute spot in one of the world's most expensive cities, send me a PM and we'll do what we can. Right now our time slot might change, so we're unable to book past September. But going forward we'll do what we can to put on as many comics as possible.",,self,,

I have always loved Standup and the reason I was drawn to performing because I always saw standups as social misfits who were maybe - just maybe - a bit like me. But it's bullshit. Listen to every comedy podcast, all you hear about is all the wild partying and girls he banged and all his good and bad times with friends and what have you. He had more interesting stuff happen to him in the early 90's than I've had in my life. THIS is an outsider? No, he's an incredibly likable, outgoing, charismatic guy. 

Jim Norton - another guy who traffics in self-deprecation - has had tons of hot girlfriends

That's just two off the top of my head. I hope you get the picture. 



So I think I've got good material and I don't have any problem on stage (I'm better on stage than in a one-on-one or party situation for sure) but at the end of the day, and god knows I'm a complete failure at networking.

**What I do...**

* When a thought occurs to me i stick it in [edit: into a note in my joke notebook]. Later I go back tag and edit and improve.
* Each note is one joke and its inextricably linked tags (tag lines that is not evernote tags).
* To make a set
* I search for that unique tag.
* I rename the jokes by prepending a number to each title so I can sort by title to get them in order. I copy them all to a new notebook

This works really well in that I then have a complete detailed set of notes for that set

What I really want is a ""collection"" which is a set of notes (I get this through the unique tag) that are ordered (the performance order) with out retitling. Then ideally I'd have the same joke in multiple collections

In so far as I know every note can't do that

Ideas?

But the question relates to joke writing. I've wanted to perform stand up for a while now, and I went to their open mic last night and the place was jam packed. I'm talking at least 50, which for a town that I thought was a comedy desert, was shattering. I wanted to start at that room's open mic because I heard it was small, but with a crowd like that, I know I need some sharp material. Dying on stage is something I expected to do my first time, that it happens to everyone, that is not a fall I want to take. So, softer jokes for larger, and how to close a set.

3. I'll reiterate. That's the only way to get better. Doing it. There is very little you can gain from posting a video from the last open mic you did four months ago. A lot of brand new guys (including myself when I started) seem to think that you can get by on digging deep into writing

4. Videos are nice for yourself

5. On open mic conduct: show up

6. Don't be a dick and don't go over your time. 

7. Don't get ahead of yourself. Focus on getting funny. 

8. Have fun.

Also I think it would be interesting if I do a blog or something

So, and listen to 25 minutes of my comedy here. I can do anywhere from 3 to 35 minutes. I could do 45 but haven't had the opportunity yet, but I have done two completely different 25 minute sets.

Also, I will plan my route and work out dates with people ahead of time. This for me is all about doing something fun and something I love after having done a job I hated for so long.

My counter is to take a nice guy approach and say ""*I really hope you're having fun tonight*"". Usually people realize they were being assholes after that and chill but an overserved (and undersexed) patron is out of control

I then threatened him with telling the bartender to cut him off, thus making everyone at the table ashamed to be sitting with drunkie. That only got me through my opening hosting set.

I brought up the first girl, but she has awesome moments of brilliance. Heckler is not TOO bad, but has a few things to say, I tell the bartender something needs to be done, bartender has a few words with drunkie, goes back to the bar and moments later drunkie makes the statement ""**Mexicans are the new n___ers**"". Loudly. Homegirl told the dude to plain ""**SHUT THE FUCK UP**""-applause break-. **The bartender says she didn't hear it**.

When she's done I bring lady 2. Some material about her mother and she points out that my mom is sitting in the suicide table. Oh yeah, this bar pays me a lot of money to put on shows there and so I'm not in a position to make this drunk apologize.

Dude came back in and couldn't even sit at the farthest spot away from the stage at the bar without misbehaving. The bartender called him a cab and he remained inside. He said something to my feature act(and very close friend) that was extremely disrespectful while on stage and I finally circumvented the bartender and told him leave and followed him out the door and the bartender followed me. I then brought up the headliner and the rest of the show went great beyond the energy drainage of the whole dealing with drunkie ordeal

It's all good

I guess why I'm posting this is

I wanted to threaten the bartenders with calling them in for overserving if they didn't 86 him on the spot

How would you have handled this differently?

tl;dr Drunk asshole at all-female comedy did some pretty low class heckling and I did not have the bar staff backing me up 100%. I eventually took matters into my own hands and *peacefully* removed him after the final straw.

But my question relates to something Louis CK says in the film. He talks about a set he was working for an hour show a few years ago. He says that 40 minutes of his set was great, is that his closer, a 5 minute bit, was killer, and he knew that no matter how shitty the 15 minutes before it were, he could always get the audience back with the closer. The sharpness of that bit let him coast on shitty material for a quarter of his show. So what he did is move the closer to the beginning of the set, and it forced him to make the other 15 minutes in that chunk better. Doing that instantly transformed that previously shitty chunk into good material.

1375127712.0,1jaqk0,Some (too many) thoughts on joke writing. Add your own.,,8,0,2,"Amateur comedian here who after almost a year of writing jokes is going to write a post that I wish I could have read before I started. 

Anything expressed is either based on my own experience or is based on the words of experienced comics.

1)	Have a notebook. 
You have been and will be amazed at how quickly ideas you don’t commit to paper leave your head. I use a pen and paper because I find the material process of actually writing in the real world makes the germ more likely to expand than it does when I type.

2)	Always write
I feel that I have to nuance this one a bit. I know Anthony Jeselnik attributes his success to his capacity to write more than his peers did. I know that Mitch Hedberg wrote the fuck out of shit. But one of the best working comics today, like Burr, CK, Stanhope and O’Neal. 
However, but anyone who is familiar with his act will see this as characteristic self-deprecation on Stanhope’s part. Furthermore, in CK’s more recent TV show, during one of the stand-up segments, CK flicks through a few pages of a notebook before beginning his performance. The pages look to be developed beyond a simple premise or two. If you watch O’Neal’s spot on the Trump Roast, (highly recommended) he makes a bit of a deal of dispensing with his prepared notes, then proceeds to go off on Jeselnik, I can’t say whether he wrote them ahead of time or came up with them on the spot, etc. writing is something most comics aspire to do but often find difficult to commit to due to laziness. Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock are two guys who are obviously conscientious joke writers, this can take a long time to achieve. I think a lot of young comics would benefit from having confidence in their own sense of humour earlier on in their career. The hardest thing about writing is how often it has to be done and there’s no avoiding that. Set aside an hour a day and if you do that consistently


3)	Listen to as much stand-up as you can. 
His name escapes me right now, this guy went on to say that because of the internet, podcasts and shows like Tough Crowd, the current generation of comics are far better at what they do much earlier than in previous generations. Michael Che is my preferred example. Look up how long he’s been doing stand-up if you want to feel bad about yourself. Take advantage of this, you wouldn’t take a musician who doesn’t listen to music seriously. I’ve listened to hundreds of thousands of hours of podcasts, radio appearances and stand up sets and they all give you a jump start on what to expect from the business, which subjects are hackneyed and which ones aren’t and will allow you to learn from the naïve mistakes of your betters. Jim Norton is a guy who doesn’t watch any comedy for fear that he’ll pick something up and recycle it in his act but I know the biggest reason that I want to do this as a career is so that I can be exposed to the funniest people in the world. Marc Maron and Joe Rogan discussed this on a recent podcast and Maron conceded that he will often find his contemporaries’ mannerisms blending into his jokes

4)	Write other stuff. 
Moshe Kasher cites someone (Buddy Hackett springs to mind, that one should always be trying to branch out. This is primarily a Los Angeles mentality, I imagine, but if hammering out a script every once in awhile is good enough for almost every major comedian working today, it’s good enough for you.
