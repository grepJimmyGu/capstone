&gt; Get hobbies and work out

I play in two bands

It's not like people suddenly throw themselves at you when you are in shape or doing your hobbies. You still have to have the confidence to approach people and talk to them. I might be good at my hobby

&gt; Learn to like yourself. Confidence comes from within.

I do like myself. So what?That doesn't give me confidence with women. Confidence comes from being actually good at something.

Do people really think your hobbies give you confidence with the opposite sex? Like I should be confident with women

&gt; Just ask her out

Theoretically, you don't want something adding to it. It just pushes you further down the low self-esteem spiral. I understand it's good to challenge your negativity, but it's still a risk.

1349395911.0,10ysm6,"1 Year in the Review: How I completely transformed my life and mind, and became successful with women and friends.",shakedown_st,100,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/10ysm6/1_year_in_the_review_how_i_completely_transformed/

It's been a full year. One full year in the making since I started this track for self-improvement.  A year ago I was socially clueless and embarrassing with women. I was consistently friend-zoned and felt that women simply weren't attracted to me. I had little confidence. I didn't know how to act around others and Hollywood defined how I viewed relationships. I was a Classic Forever Alone Nice Guy. I sent my crush a dozen cupcakes ﻿*after* I told her my feelings for her and her rejecting me. It's difficult to believe that I actually thought that would be a good idea.

Truth is, but shunned Nice Guys like me. I was lonely and depressed but I was comfortable. Very comfortable. Loneliness *was* the comfort zone. I finally found others like me.

Then

First

The second thing that happened was, I became determined to become good with women.

I told my boss what happened with that night and then he told me about this book called The Game that he'd been reading. Shortly after that

The first month consisted of me just reading absolutely everything and then testing it out ""in the field"". I asked /r/seduction bunch of questions about this and that or whatever, I was having mixed results. Most girls would totally blow me off, but a few would stick around and have a conversation with me. This was all new as I'd never done anything like this before. But I felt I was making progress in a few short weeks. I felt comfortable that I could approach someone with a canned routine and have all these little games to play to keep her entertained. More importantly though, in hindsight, I began to notice a pattern with my brain. The mental state I was in would have a direct impact on any success I had. It wouldn't matter what I said or to who, if I had those Forever Alone thoughts, I would fail, I felt like I was getting better with each approach I'd make. It wasn't until the 31st

The next two months were quiet. I read a lot of books that were a complete waste of my time. All I did was try to memorize routines and have some kind of answer to every possible response a girl would have. I spent too much time on /r/seduction thinking that they had all the answers that I needed. In reality, I was chasing red herrings. I had only gotten a handful of numbers in those first 3 months and I felt I had hit a wall in my progress. These so-called ""routines"" would only get me so far. I would find I would run out of 'material' and have to rely on myself to keep a conversation going. As 2011 was coming to a close, I realized I needed to change tactics. Shift away from routines and 'classic game' to simply focus on becoming an awesome person. Thought I'd finally check this stuff out called ""inner game"". How could this ""inner game"" concept help me if it didn't tell me what to say to a girl?

The most important book I've read above all else was No More Mr. Nice Guy. It really was the wake-up call that I needed. It's a must read for any Classic Forever Alone Nice Guy. I then read the Definitive Book of Body Language and watched Tyler Durden's Blueprint Decoded series. All having huge impact on how I viewed the world. It became less about routines and more about the reality in which I lived. [See list of my favorite books here](http://www.shakedownlab.com/books-and-resources/).

The next 6 weeks I began having real significant success

It was around this time that I became disillusioned with /r/seduction. I was upset that I had wasted two months early in my self improvement. I felt that the subreddit was not conducive to absolute

The rest of February and most of March was marked by getting a bunch of girls' numbers and a few failed first dates. But progress was steady. I read Magic Bullets, and The Way of the Superior Man (most important here). All excellent books. 

I was kind of used to going out alone

We began dating exclusively. I will consider her my first real girlfriend ever. However, fun to be around, and *radiated energy*. I decided to [end it after 6 weeks of dating](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/05/16/just-dumped-the-girl-i-was-seeing/). This was a learning experience in its own right and needed to happen. I knew what I wanted out of a girl and I knew that I was capable of finding it. I wouldn't just settle for the sake of having a girlfriend.

**1. WHAT IS A ""NICE GUY""?**

&gt; **bash.org:**

&gt; A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we'll hire somebody else

This reasoning right here is the epitome of ""Nice Guy"" thinking.

Basically a ""Nice Guy"" is someone who wonders why if they are so nice and good to women

Some quotes that are helpful:

&gt; **Vulvarine posted:**

&gt; I think it's really important to distinguish between niceness and kindness. *Kindness is a real

    
&gt; **Ionic posted:**

&gt; One of the keys to understanding the Nice Guy vs. the clueless innocent is that the Nice Guy's definition of himself as such is usually the result of repeated romantic failure and a resulting

&gt; I don't want to make this into more than it is, vulnerable a woman can feel in the face of persistent attention, flattery, and the like. 

&gt; It flies in the face of years and years of social conditioning to tell an outwardly ""nice"" man - one who has in no way technically threatened, I'm not interested."" It's one thing to tell off the drunk who's trying to cop a feel on the subway (and even that isn't always easy). But rejecting the friend who just won't stop hanging around looking for more? It's not a simple situation.

&gt; So, we opt for subtlety instead.

&gt; And that's where the real problem with Nice Guys comes in. A regular guy would get the hint, on the other hand, will stick around and attempt to wear you down.  Often Nice Guys will pursue ""'hard luck' cases"" - women who are perhaps not the best-prepared to stand up for themselves. 

&gt; And in the end

&gt; To sum up, and the NG's persistence in the face of what many other individuals would recognize as subtle signals of mark's disinclination to mate. 

* **1.1 Manipulation**

NG behaviour is manipulative. NGs basically do everything they can to 'make' someone fall for them in an underhanded way. It makes every ""nice"" act revolve around the ulterior goal of getting with 'that' girl. They do it so hard that it becomes a second nature and they're not even conscious of it.

* **1.2 Unrealistic objectification**

NG behaviour ultimately reduces women to objects. While they would vehemently deny it, which blinds them to the fact that these women are independent people. 

* **1.3 Dishonesty**

NGs are not nice for the sake of being nice. They're nice because they think they'll get something in return. Granted that many people behave that way

* **1.4 It doesn't work**

Most women and many men can sense that you're a ""Nice Guy"", Y and Z so if I do that, I'll get laid"", the Nice Guy Technique has appalling success rates.

* **1.5 ""Ugh

Nobody likes assholes, have interesting stuff to say, are attractive or act like actual people instead of a scripted doormat.* Also, maybe her SO is acting hostile towards you because he can sense your true motives. 

* **1.6 Passiveness**

One particular reason why the ""friendship"" between an NG and their 'one true love' or whatever is shallow and questionable is that NGs typically don't go in against their object's opinions (unless their position is threatened somehow)

* **1.7 ""I am nice""**

NGs often describe themselves as being ""nice"", if the first thing that comes up in your mind, or in others' if you need to be described, is ""nice"", then you have a problem because it means you're not particularly seen as having personality.


**2. TYPICAL NICE GUY EXCUSES**

* **2.1 ""But I am genuinely a friend.""**

If you are, but prefer pining in the shadows, bottling up massive frustrations.

* **2.2 ""But in that movie/novel...""**

Popular culture tends to feed the idea that the NG thing is somehow cute, and if you're going to take dating advice from pop culture, well, then I don't know what to say.

* **2.3 ""If she doesn't like it

Nice guys make an advance that cannot be rejected in a socially acceptable way. If a guy says, then it's perfectly socially acceptable to say, ""Nah, I'm not interested."" But instead he might say, ""Oh, you're moving? I'd love to help. When? Hmm, I'm working that day, but I could rent one of those ones from the Home Depot."" Is this guy really helpful just generally, I am honor-bound not to accept your offer of assistance""? Of course not. So you don't say it, you relax a little

* **2.4 ""Welp

Apart from being a non-argument/false dichotomy (it's not one or the other), but with a mask of niceness. You can certainly be a nice person without the deeper layers of manipulation, self-pity and self-entitlement.

**3. HOW TO SNAP OUT OF BEING A ""NICE GUY""**

* **3.1** Realise that the world doesn't owe you anything

* **3.2** Stop being a passive-aggressive doormat and be more candid about your desires. This will mean having to take rejection

* **3.3** Don't pine. Realise that there are many

* **3.4** Realise that there is no ""manual"" to women, seek therapy.

Lastly

It starts with men simply being intimidated by women. Many of these guys don't know how to effectively approach women and they aren't assertive or interesting, etc. etc."" It's pathetic and undesirable, but not necessarily malicious.

It's when this plan fails again and again, nice guys do finish last."" But he really does behave as though a woman's rejection is a breach of contract. The Nice Guy is delusional and wrong, just not consciously so.

So that's the purpose of the OP: to serve as a wake up call for all the well-intentioned but misguided ""Nice Guys"" who aren't conscious of what they're really doing.

1355700740.0,14ypjh,New here - Some things I did to improve myself,pacificstar,60,8,13,"Hi guys

I grew up in a really small and racist town.  I was the only Indian kid (dot not feather!!) and even the parents of my close friends didn't realize the impact of what they would say.  I remember a friends (white) mother saying to me ""Don't you think it's disgusting when the races mix?"".  So I was always in a bit of a fragile place.  

Anyway, and very self-conscious a nervous when meeting new people.

My second year I decided that something had to change.  So what I did was the following:

1) I joined the residence hall government.
2) I sold candy grams in the dorm lobby.
3) I made a rule for myself that whenever I'm in an elevator with another person
4) Every day at the university bus stop
5) If someone invited me out

It was really rough

Fast forward a few years later and I moved to a new city for a job.  I knew literally 0 people in town and Atlanta isn't an especially easy place to meet new people.  To meet people

1) Joined an asian professional organization. Everyone at a prof. organization is there to network.  Easy way to meet a lot of people.
2) Joined amateur sports league.  I joined ALTA tennis league in Atlanta at a fairly low level.  The administrators matched with a team at my skill level in town.  Most of the time we'd go for dinner/drinks after practice a matches.  Great way to meet new people
3) Went out alone.  Some days you just have to do it.  
4) Went to meetups - these were mostly a bust

Anyway

Her: ""I never date guys like you""
Me: ""Really?  Why did you decide to come out with me?""
Her: ""You just seemed so relaxed and confident""

That's really what it was all about.  I am not an especially good (or bad) looking guy.  I'm a horrible dancer

I have always dreaded the conversation with the barber, at the end of the haircut, the lovely older lady asked me how old I was, and was astonished when I told her 23 as she said I composed myself as a 50 year old professional. She gave me half off my haircut, because she said she had the best time with me today than she had in a while with her clients. I walked out looked up at the sky and said “What the hell just happened?” Even smaller interactions with cashiers, and people in general have been more fun for me. 

I was having breakfast with a family member telling him about this book when this intimidating black man came up to us to ask us if anything was alright in typical manager fashion. I ended up chatting with him about the end of the world (since it was 12/21) and he opened up about his life by the end of the short chat. My brother looked at me

So I'm a 24 year old guy that literally has had little to no social growth since high school.

I grew up with a fucked up opinion of women from my parents (My dad is a womanizing asshole that manipulates my mom and can't tie himself down to one woman, and it makes me nauseous that I put some poor girl through that shit.  I'm actually glad she decided to stop seeing me, because she's a confident incredible person that doesn't deserve to be chained to a guy like me who's stuck in giant depression pit.

Seriously

Lets not mistake shit here, I think that shit is disrespectful and creepy.  All I've ever wanted was a connection with someone, as relationships are basically next level friendships that I don't fully understand.  I don't resent girls for not dating me, I generally hate myself for not being more likeable.  Honestly I wouldn't really date myself if I were another person.

So let's look at who I am now.  I'm almost 25, and in general I'm a giant pussy.  I have an associate's degree that basically says I'm qualified to press buttons on a computer, and I don't have time to go back to school because I made the call to leave my parents' house before it fell apart beneath me.

I'm afraid of losing my job, and smash my computer into pieces and walk out.
My boss is a dick that gets bent out of shape if you're 2 minutes late.  It's increasingly annoying

I hate going out alone to things because I feel isolated.  I pretty much get looked over and ignored when I go out, the anxiety comes back, and the paralyzing fear creeps in.

My hair isn't cut because I don't care, my debt load isn't going anywhere and I'm pretty much stuck in place being a mediocre shitfest of garbage.  I'm sick of it.

I honestly shouldn't be dating because I can't afford it.  I can't afford to go out to clubs

I can't even afford therapy

I just don't know where to turn or what to do.  I live in a decent sized city.  I've pretty much let low self esteem and depression push me all the way down to the bottom

I feel like disappearing from everyone I've known and basically nuke my life from orbit, and just disappearing.  But I'm almost certain that if I did this I would fail.

I don't want to be me anymore.  It's tiring

I'm a scrawny nerd with social anxiety disorder, and I haven't gotten laid since I was 18. But I think I've found the most direct path to strong personal confidence: Raising your testosterone.

---

Here's my observation: I've lurked on /r/seduction for a while now and you can easily find thread upon thread upon thread of PUAs trying to convince AFCs how to have better inner game by just ""explaining"" that mental state

I've only been lifting for around 2 months now, starting saying things without worry of repercussions. I still battle depression, but I'm not as self-deprecating as I was before. I started wondering about this, and I realized that it's not the aesthetics that gives you confidence, but the boost in testosterone!

I started researching this a bit over the past couple of weeks. I found shit-loads of good articles that relate the effects testosterone has on depression, self-esteem, etc, etc. I'm not going to dump a bunch of links on you. I'm just going to point out one really good paper that summarizes recent research and highlight the points it made. The more academic minded can read that paper and nit-pick any mistakes I made, but I think the conclusion is fairly obvious.

**The role of testosterone in social interaction**

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5317066/2011-eisenegger-role-testosterone-social-interaction.pdf

(I used the page numbers in the lower-right corner)

**Dominance**: In contrast to the controversial role of testosterone in aggression

**More Dominance**: Measurements of testosterone at a single time-point _correlate positively with high dominance_ in both adolescents and adults. [265]

**High Status**: Several recent studies suggest that testosterone facilitates particular social emotional mechanisms that tend to enhance the ability of an individual to achieve and maintain a _high social status_. [265]

**Not Giving a Fuck**: Humans are generally aware of, however, _this awareness might be detrimental_, as it could boost concern for the other party at the expense of one’s own status drive. Thus, if testosterone facilitates status seeking, it is conceivable that it might _suppress emotion inference capacity_. [266]

**Maintaining Strong Eye Contact**: Recent results provide direct support for the hypothesis that _speed of gaze aversion_ from masked facial anger depends on self reported motives of dominance and submission. [266]

**Maintaining High Status**: Maintaining a high status position requires an increased sensitivity for aversive events and impending social threats, it appears to confer _high motivational drive_, _low fearfulness_ and _high stress resilience_, either directly or via interactions with other hormones and neurotransmitter systems. [267]

**Lower AA**: Several studies have shown that testosterone administration _reduces anxiety-like behavior_ in rodents in several behavioral paradigms, these results suggest that testosterone takes its effects on status seeking through _decreasing fear_. [269]

**Staying Calm**: A further important function of testosterone is its role in motivation; animal models have shown a tight link with the dopaminergic system within striatal areas. Thus

1) Have interests outside of gaming.  We all wish that our amazing k/d ratio or apm would score chicks but its just a fact of life that it doesn't.  Gaming for many people becomes a fairly antisocial activity (I do think there is a lot of merit to online friends, but I think a lot of FA type people use gaming or other non-social activities to extreme levels, to the point where you are doing it to the exclusion of other things.  Maybe it started out that way just because it was so fun, but eventually most of us realize physical human contact is important.   So just find some other thing you enjoy and spend time doing it.  For me, I have a dog that I take on runs and to the dog park for 1-2 hours a day.  I already have a good relationship, but I meet lots of cute girls who seem to like me just because I have an attractive, well behaved dog.

2) Get in shape.  I'm not going to debate whether this is right or wrong or good or bad (I honestly dont believe in right and wrong).  The simple fact is girls (and everyone really) is influenced by our society and culture, which is a good reason to do it anyway.  You really don't have to be excessive about this.  At some point I just decided this was something I needed to do, and I started spending 5-10 minutes lifting weights before I shower every day, and running ~15-20 min around the block with my dog most days.  Its amazing how much difference that little bit can make if you keep up with it for a long time.  If you want faster results, you can put in more work to get it.

That's it.  You were probably waiting for some big revelation/secret, but that is just what everyone has to go through.  Once you have some experience you will understand better how to have a healthy relationship.  You can read/study all you want about how to do a relationship right, but IMO you just have to try it and feel things out.  Its different for everyone.

I should probably say something about fear of rejection, but there is really no way to argue that fear of rejection is somehow healthy, or part of being a nice guy.  Its just one of those things you eventually have to do and get over.  Love and sex with a girl is well worth it.

TL;DR: If you want to get girls you should get in physical shape and care about things other than video games.  If you just leave your house and talk to girls (or with a lot of hobbies, give them some idea that you are happy and have interests / things you care about, and you will eventually get a girlfriend.",,False,,t5_2tav6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/15piqo/how_to_be_a_nice_guy_and_still_get_beautiful/

So the hivemind in these subreddits say, ""Oh my God! I've been dating jerks all this time

Now I'm sure you've all done this at one point or another. If you've read my posts, Derp. I really only see you as a friend, and I hope we can remain friends"". This is reality.

You're in the friendzone, ""Hmm, was that creepy?"" Yes, it was.

Unloading your feelings onto her simply does not work. It's a self-sabotage technique. **And on a deep, but you do it anyway.** This is part of being Forever Alone. It's that mindset that you deserve to be alone, so you'll actually sabotage your relationships, but in a way that makes you seem like a victim. Reality is, **you're being manipulative and self-serving.** But if you're here in [/r/faimprovement](/r/faimprovement) , you're obviously trying to change that. Good.

Okay, instead of telling her, **demonstrate** through actions that you are interested in her. Find some activities to do together. Like take her out dancing, hiking, bars, picnics, ice skating, *increase physical contact* with her. Touch her a lot more than you used to. Women respond and are much more sensitive to touch than men. It's very powerful. Eventually, to a kiss.

Now the more you do of this

tl;dr: Telling her how much you love her is self-sabotage, showing her how much fun you are to be with, all the while escalating physical contact. She can take a hint.

I had girlfriends, 2) sustained my brain injury, and 3) reached that magical age where guys are expected to have jobs. I guess a couple of things (girls) have come up since then, but not many, and I screwed those opportunities up. But really, when I think back, I didn't even WANT to be in a relationship when I'm as screwed up as I am.

&gt;College is basically four more years of the same thing, but you can get out and do more stuff.

&gt;Then you graduate college. Half of your friends move away to get jobs. Most of those that haven't moved away, and it wasn't until December that they hired anyone remotely in my age group (actually she's just six months younger than me). The next-closest person is 7 years older than I am. It's not that I'd mind hanging out with a 33-34 year old coworker, but she's practically married and lives an hour away from the office, so no, we're not going to hang out outside of work. There are a couple who are about 10-12 years older, and they're married with young kids. The rest of them are pretty much at least in their late 40's. Nice people, but we're not talking about people who are just a little older here . . . it's a legitimate generation gap.
I don't know what else to do. Most of my friends work jobs with other people in their age group, let alone whether I'll be able to find anyone that's available and interested in dating me.

Children approach playing games, and that mission is to have lots of turns. They sometimes actually rate their success that way, saying something like ""I had four turns and Charlie only had three--I win!""

Adults are very different. We want to sit back, we would usually prefer to have no turn at all.

Children want lots of turns

As adults, but none of them was seven. All children think they're brilliant artists and want their drawings displayed on the refrigerator. As adults, even if we secretly think we can draw, we hide our sketches away under the bed: ""Don't look at those--they're just some silly things I was doodling."" The thing is, we all were those children. We believed we were great artists, we sang and danced when we were happy and acted out cops and robbers for hours. No one ever stopped and said, ""I'm not a very good robber. I've run out of ideas. I think I need to research my character."" We always had endless ideas. Endless positivity. Endless faith in our own talent. What happened to us?

One answer is: our education. We hope at least that your education was free because,"" and who claims they ""can't"" sing, dance, draw, act, or speak in public and who has no imagination.

When you're at school, thinking about your essay, what will happen? The teacher will shout at you. She'll say ""You! You're not even trying!."" She would know if you were trying because trying looks like something. If your shoulders are hunched and you look worried and a little ill, then the teacher will probably come and do it for you. We learn to look anxious before we do things--like we're not up to it.

We also tend to punish ourselves after we do things. Two adults will volunteer for something, ""Well, never mind, everyone drops things from time to time,"" and you clean it up in a relaxed and happy fashion, your mother will shout at you. That in our society is a ""bad attitude."" A ""good attitude"" is to cry and feel worthless. Then your mother will say, ""Never mind, it was only an accident,,False

From the time we were born

However

As we got older

I for one have had enough. My addiction takes so much out of me. My mind does not settle in any reality setting. It keeps wandering and drifting off to my addictions. I have had enough of ""The perfect world"". I'm through tricking myself with fake worlds/fake maps/fake people (NPCs) and a fake life.

I want reality. Its not fair that My friends have better real lives. It just isn't. My anxiety has fucked up a lot of things. But I want to control it. I want to live with it without losing my shit and getting stomach cramps in social settings. The answer cannot be the internet. It cannot be RPGs. It is more exposure. 

I had an experience of getting rejected a few years ago. It was the most painful thing I have experienced (not counting anxiety migraines). It got me depressed for 6 months. I felt like a useless person. I won't go into details of all the self-doubt and insecurity. But towards the end

You know what I did? I grew. I identified my serious flaws. Started working on them. Though my addiction never really recovered, thought more about myself, and i learned self-maintenance. Because the more we upgrade, the more maintenance we need.

I got rid of That fucking shelter. I threw it away. I let my instinct take over. I adapted to social settings

 Now, fucking it all up. Feeling like $2. Fuck. I need the feeling of rejection.

1360133960.0,17zkot,My Surprisingly Conversational Day,ericbn2011,24,3,2,"Hey everyone. So my Monday was one filled with conversations.

My day started at 10am doing homework I should have done on Sunday night but didn't because of the Super Bowl. I was in the Business School building when I noticed a guy on the same bench as me to my right had the same book that I used in a class my freshman year. I tried to say something to him about it but he either ignored me or didn't hear me so I blow it off; I didn't care. Then I tried about 10 minutes later and same thing happened.

But then I looked to my left and there was this girl and I said to her

The second conversation I had was with the same girl from my last update, but the main takeaway that I got from it was that I can get along with someone who turned me down, which is something I didn't know before because I had never asked anyone else out in college.

The third conversation was with a British girl in my Political Science class. I don't know her name, music. I have a strange love affair with local British rock so we get to talking about that and she has been to all these festivals and it makes me want to go to festivals too. Maybe when I have money. Anyway, it was a nice conversation and I got to know England from an English person's perspective and I got to know a classmate better.

Oh and I got a different girl's number

So what's the point of this post? Is it to bitch? Yeah
So let's say one day you're driving along, and then, when you pull over, looks at you like you're the crazy one. What's the first thing you do after you're done dealing with said dingbat, the police and the insurance companies? Do you proceed with the day as planned? No! You do step number one:         

1) **Take a chill pill**          

No matter how ok you think you are, bitch!), the best course of action at this point is to cancel everything that can be cancelled, go home and watch Robocop 3, now available on Netflix. Now this is a very specific scenario, added for comedic purposes, but the point is this: whenever you're overwhelmed with Stuff, relax and take it in. This applies to anything: loosing your job, then you need to reduce the stress in areas you do have control over. **Temporarily** cut out working out, after that it becomes a bad habit.           

1.5) **Bonus sub-step: Drink lots of tea with honey and relax**      

I read somewhere that your blood sugar levels directly affect your will power. Since then tea with honey have been my evening drink of choice(Yogi Tea Kombucha
Now let's say that the car accident is just a cherry on top of your bullshit sundae. Let's say that you also have to deal with oh, bureaucratic red tape on two continents pertaining to your job, bureaucratic red tape on two continents pertaining to your personal matters, your little side business unexpectedly kicking you in the balls, Klingons(don't ask), and filing taxes. What do you do then? This is where you do the second step, while taking a chill pill and drinking your delicious sweet tea. You:          

2 **Make a plan of attack**         

A good plan starts out with you writing everything down using the same tools as the ones used by George Washington during his plan to birth America: pen and paper(or parchment and quill, then think back to your 5th grade math. Try to ignore the fond memories of that first time you noticed boobs on Mrs. Austin, who, let's face it, had a pretty nice rack despite the fact that she was 53. Instead think about the lesson about finding the smallest common denominator, and breaking things down to the simplest numbers. Do the same for your problems. Break up Big Problems into smaller ones and pair those small problems with simple solutions. Make a nice, organized ""problem-solution"" list starting with the simplest solutions at the top. One thing you might notice is that nowadays many problems can be solved with ""make a phone call"". That's your task list, for the nerdy ones.                

3) **Get a ""clicky"" pen**         

4) **Use the ""clicky"" pen to scratch off tasks as you complete them**           

Important note: use the ""clicky"" pen exclusively for starching off tasks and before you know it
As you complete the simplest tasks something magical will happen, you'll feel better, more in control, and more motivated to complete harder, more time consuming tasks. When you have a giant heap to work through, and things seemingly pile on no matter what you do, well, and therefore unmotivated. Making a dummy-proof plan(by the way, you know what you will do and what will be the result of it. It's an awesome state of mind to be in and it'll help you with the final step:              

5) **Adjust your plan on the fly and never give up**         

Not everything you do will work on the first try. If you fail once, if you stop, then it'll just sit there, growing mold and stinking up your life. The difference between adults and children is that adults realize there is no good or bad, there are just actions and consequences. Children hope that something will break that chain, that there can be actions without consequences, or that there can be outcomes without actions. It's called ""wishing"". Every time you go ""I wish..."" and don't do anything about it, I wish I didn't have all these problems..."" Guess what? You're the only one who can change that. *But guess what?* You totally have the power to! It's like you're your own magic Genie that can grant any wish, maybe even your dream.

If you don't know what I'm talking about

I like this forum quite a bit because I find that most of the people who post here are generally not whiners who blame everyone else for their problems. They genuinely want to make positive changes in their lives

My favorite types of people to work with when I do therapy and mentoring are the people who have self-awareness. They understand the impact of their own decisions

The types of people I don't enjoy working with are the people who complain a lot about their lives
I've been thinking in the last few days how else I can try to support the people who read this forum. I read in another post that some people are interested in doing a men's group. I have an idea that may or may not work, so I do have some experience with it). 

It would involve weekly group meetings, I can act as a ""personal trainer"" of sorts - someone who will check in and see how the goals are going, push them when they're feeling poorly about meeting goals, offer encouragement, etc.
In order for this to work, and checking in to see if they are doing these exercises. E.g. For someone who has social anxiety and really doesn't like to leave the house, I might tell them to walk around the block once as a starting goal. Then we would check in about that, see how they felt, and set bigger goals for them to accomplish if that worked out. That's just an example, and it will be different for each person in the group. Once a week, you will all come together online, and support each other.

If anyone is interested in this, 2) Why you would benefit from being in this group, and 3) Anything you feel like telling me about your age, occupation, level of education, interests like favorite movies, music, you could link me to that if you'd prefer. The purpose of 3) is to help match people. A group is not going to work out well if you have nothing in common. Most importantly

In the book it said to try to find and join or make a men's group. Well men's groups are surprisingly hard to find and I don't really have that big of a social circle so I thought I was SOL. But then it hit me

So here's my idea and it's so crazy it might just work. Basically have a men's group made up of members of this subreddit. We could choose a time and day of the week to meet on and then use Oovoo or Google Hangouts to have the meetings. I just need to get an idea about how many guys would be interested in doing this.

I'm 31, sure, I'm not perfect, but there's nothing about me that would give someone the sense that ""yeah, he's probably a virgin in his 30s"". The thing is, it has become a pretty dark secret, and I'm really squeamish about talking about it with anyone or sharing it with anyone.

Apr 12

**""Safe"" guys vs. ""Unsafe"" guys.**

Please,"" then don't read this. It's not going to help. It might be helpful if you're actually a nice guy and don't just think you are one. Because actual nice guys don't think like that.

""Be confident. Women are attracted to guys who have confidence.""

What does that actually mean? I keep hearing this and it's not very specific or informative. Confidence. There are so many ways this can be interpreted. You could be an amazing guitar player, or be the best damn cook you know. In these cases, you're probably very confident at what you do. But these skills do not necessarily equate to being able to attract girls. Confidence in dating is something different, and there are certain traits that convey this confidence. I'll try to explain...

I believe there are two types of guys, psychopathic, or have unprotected sex. It's a type of personality. I can usually tell within a few hours of meeting a guy, any random guy, if he's ""safe"" or ""unsafe"". Characteristics of ""safe"" - predictable, caring, very nice guys who you know will drop everything to be with you, very sweet. The type of guy you'd want to have a family with - good father, I hope you ARE one of these guys. You'll make a girl very happy one day. But how to find this girl? How do you get to the stage where a girl you're interested in becomes interested in you? This is stage 1 of the relationship. You're not going to be able to show the girl how awesome you are if she doesn't give you a chance. I'll talk more about this later.

Let's move on to characteristics of ""unsafe"". I'm going to summarize it as an ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude. It's about being your own person. Not being needy, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you. Someone who doesn't need a lot of validation from others. All that is what I think ""confidence"" really means. Are you the type of person who tells a joke, then looks around to see if anyone laughs? That's needing validation. Not giving a fuck is telling a joke and being chill about it if no one laughs.

A lot of guys who fall into the ""unsafe"" category are emotionally unavailable. They can be selfish, but they just aren't. Attraction can't be forced, and I'm not talking about how you look. It's that confidence/unsafe shit. If they don't feel it, they don't feel it. So maybe having ""unsafe"" characteristics will get the attraction started, and having ""safe"" characteristics will keep the relationship going. Guys, don't be a dick. I'm pretty sure I'm not conveying this very well right now, but do not treat women poorly. Borrowing/displaying ""unsafe"" characteristics (being your own person, being independent

Here's an example of what I'm trying to say. Sometimes a guy doesn't even need to talk to convey whether they are ""safe"" or ""unsafe"". A few years ago, I could not take my eyes off the lead guitarist the entire time. He's totally not my type at all, but he really had the ""I don't give a fuck"" thing going on. While the lead singer was bouncing around, this guy was just mellowing out, playing his guitar like there was no one else there watching. Very understated and nonchalant. Didn't need validation. At the end of the day, the better looking lead singer with all the charm and charisma probably has a higher probability of having sex with the groupies (if he's into that). But the understated guy is probably getting laid too, without doing much at all. I don't know how easy it is to be charming and funny like the hot lead singer

I don't have time to write much more now, called ""50 Shades of Grey"", and it's been dubbed ""mommy porn"" by the media. It's selling really well, especially for a dirty novel. I read a lot of reviews about this book and thought I wouldn't like it much, but decided to read the first few chapters free on Amazon, got sucked in, then bought it. It's better than I thought, but he really cares about the girl and he's not scared to show it. There are a lot of other characters in the book who have an interest in the main female character too

In particular there was this one time where I asked this girl to dance and we did, I took her hand and smiled and led her out and just started teaching her, and laughing and twirling and everything. I mean... what? Me? The anxious, scared guy? Just being as natural as a fish in water being this charming man, a real man, an alpha male, with this beautiful woman. What the heck? But I did it. Seriously

The amazing thing about this kind of environment is that there's no awkwardness (aside from you messing up when you dance, you finish the dance and say ""thanks!"" and walk away like it was nothing and feel no anxiety. If you want you could continue talking to people, which I did do sometimes, and people always love to talk.    

I noticed several things. Women would smile and swoon and get really excited and talk to me. I noticed lots of women really just want to look into your eyes and be seduced. I noticed lots of women want to flirt with you. I'd be so excited about dancing that I had no problems talking and dancing with anyone. I was completely and utterly out of my head and in my body and my feelings and the present moment. I was being present with the women as well. It is everything I have learned that I should do but can't do. But when I'm in this environment I can do it easily. I noticed women were looking at me across the room after I dance with them, I don't really care. We're just out dancing and trying.

When I went out in real life the next day, because I know how to touch a woman on the dance floor without being creepy and being confident.    

I recommend taking some classes and going out to dance socially as well. I am going again next week.",,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/1bah1u/try_dancing/

Now, based on the idea of deconstructing something that people seem to think is very complicated into something very simple. That got me to thinking about how people of our situation (on the road to self improvement) can often see the massive complexities in any given situation, and fail to realize that sometimes things are incredibly simple. 

With that

&gt; A lot of people here seem to feel that dating can be a complex

An oversimplification? Perhaps. I think, lunch, or dinner? Should it be any different talking to this one person that it is when I talk to my co-workers, my family, or someone at the store? I'm just talking. That's not all that hard.

Things were going extremely well until today morning. Until today, but seeing all the attractive women at my workplace brought some very dark thoughts to the forefront of my mind.

I couldn't stop thinking about how I've pissed away the last 17 years of my life while everyone around me - men and women - have made great strides in both their personal and professional lives. They've experienced far better things than I have. 22 year olds have seen much more of the world than I have at 28. I haven't had the sexual experiences they've had. I haven't known women all across the spectrum of human personality unlike the fortunate many.

I realize that these thoughts serve no purpose besides undermining my state of mind. I know that my past can't be changed and it's futile to dwell on it. I know that I should be looking forward. But while I understand this intellectually, they're nothing more than a distraction. Self-improvement matters much more than companionship. Focus on what matters.""

I spent my childhood in the anus of Eastern Europe, bullying was a regular occurence for me. There were beatdowns from bigger kids but also venomous putdowns from girls. I could go into lengths as to why it happened and how miserable it made me feel, but it's in the past now. Suffice to say that being around peers was hell and I longed to be in an environment where I was some unnoticeable hermit crab.

After 6 years of tests, the awkwardness of adolescence was amplified by the being some strange kid who has never seen shiny cars, or planes, or affluent communities. But to be frank, it was mostly me being a strange and misanthropic weirdo with the fashion sense of a scarecrow.

Since then I have been through the army

All these things I freely admit to myself and have no pretenses of being some poor, and sex.

The night before I went out with my bosses for happy hour and they're learning all this stuff too so we were helping each other out. That was a fun night as well so I was still feeling confident and talkative. So out into the freezing cold snow I go and make my way to the bar.

I stand in the center of the bar with tons of people around me for like 30 minutes. I just stare at the sports game on the TV for what felt like forever with a Jack &amp; Coke in my hand.

I'm standing here alone with a drink and nothing is going to happen.""

I caught myself and stopped that line of thinking immediately and began looking for girls to approach. Grow some balls shakedown_st! Approach! Approach! Approach! Fuck, brain!

I must say

At this point it was all get-to-know-you stuff and building comfort and rapport. I told some stories and ran some of the other stuff like The Cube and she loved it. It was very accurate.

This girl is really awesome and I love her personality. We have a lot of similar interests so everything just seemed to be clicking. The whole while

Eventually I pull her in

We acknowledged that we wanted to see each other again and exchanged numbers. I know say this every week lol

The first eight years were decent. I had maybe three or four neighborhood friends I hung out with

Things started to turn to shit after fourth grade. All my neighborhood friends turned against me for my social ineptitude, but the teachers and students convinced me to give it a try... when I threw myself back, no arms were there to catch me. I was sent home with a bloody bandage on my head. The bullies were able to pass it off as an accident and were not punished.

* Severe Keratosis Pillaris (red bumps on every inch of my skin)

* Autism (basically, and extreme noise sensitivity)

Then, 8"" blonde walks in, alone, like she was picked right out of 1960. She was wearing a genuine 1950s dress and jewelry. She was there alone and I can tell she was attracted to me right away because there were dozens of seats open at the bar but she sits at the one two down from me so there was only one seat open between us. Here I go.

The more I do this, but really...Just say something. I ended up using a boring and awkward opener that just came to my head at that minute. 

*pick up my drink* ""Can't watch Mad Men without a whiskey neat in your hand""

She laughs and just starts talking to me. Within a minute I move to sit next to her. She was showing every single classic sign of attraction with regards to body language

Best part: Tons of people showed up to this premiere party. Like 100+ at least, ""Hey man, she is fucking beautiful. Hang in there and keep up the great work."" Lol, wow.

We live one metro stop away from each other so I number closed and we acknowledged that we wanted to see each other again. I gave her a kiss on the cheek

I go out alone (again) to a concert I've been looking forward to. Just wanted to go and have a good time. The crowd is a much older crowd given the music I'm into

The cute girl and I stood next to each other for like 90 minutes until the break. Our bodies kept bumping into each other as we moved to the beat

It dawns on me that this girl is high as a kite. I've never smoked weed in my life

The show starts back up again and she kind of gets away from me. Now, but that's what this girl did. So I let it go, but eventually I kind of snuck my way up near her, but her friend was inbetween us and she wasn't making any effort to come to me. Game over.

It's the final song of the night and it's about half way over when she leans in to me and asks me if I like the song or not. Interesting. I say yeah

She pulls back and shakes her head no. I say alright and give her a playful shove and turn my back to listen to the music again. 10 seconds later she leans in to me again and says, but didn't feel comfortable in the environment? Granted, no one else was really dancing. ...I don't know...I was all confused. Can't figure this girl out *at all*.

When the concert was over and people started filing out

Hopefully I can turn this into a date!

Here is the method that Forever Alones can use to ask girls out without totally freaking out and making a big deal about it (FAs typically make a bigger deal about things than they need to). But first

Enough delay

Find something *you* want to do. Even better if you can get 2 or 3 of your friends to do the activity with you. The important thing here is that it has to be something you are willing to do by yourself. If the activity is something that you would not do if your date was not there, then you are still doing an activity that you want to do anyway.**

Now here's an important part. If you get 2 or 3 friends to do the activity with you

Just text her, but if she wants to, she can join you.

If she agrees

Assuming she accepts the date

There you go. Have fun!

When something bad happens to the pessimist, and those relationships suffer. If you’ve read /r/foreveralone, you realize that these people are scared as hell, and many of them refuse to accept a proper level of personal responsibility for negative happenings. A pessimist gets blown out but by a crush, and thinks, “What about me is unattractive to everyone? What is wrong with the opposite sex/humanity? It’s not fair that I am forever alone.”

When something bad happens to an optimist, but he refuses to let a single event ruin his future. He has the ability to approach life with a healthy level of vulnerability, realizing that bad things may happen again in the future but unafraid of negative results. An optimist gets blown out by a crush, and thinks, “What about how I acted wasn’t attractive to that one person? What are traits of that one person that I didn’t like? What, if anything, can I learn from this experience that will help me in my next human relationship?”

It isn’t at all easy to change the way your brain copes with negative experiences and future uncertainty. It takes a lot of practice to adjust your go-to maneuver. Quite often, however, if you catch yourself overgeneralizing or becoming too paranoid about people or life, to take a step back and reevaluate the scenario from a healthier point of view. There’s no need to let your past experiences turn you into an afraid, insecure, unhappy human being. Learn what needs to be learned, and utilize this information to create a happier future. Your next crush might thank you for it. :)

[No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=No+more+mr+nice+guy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)

This book represents nearly every single FA I encounter, it is indicative of other problems. You cannot proceed without changing your whole current mindset and this book will do that.

Here are two excerpts -- 

""Todd prides himself on treating women with honesty and respect. He believes these traits set him apart from other men and should attract women to him. Though he has many female friends, rather than Nice Guys like him""

Also this, his hobbies. He will do whatever it takes to make her happy. He will give her gifts, try to fix her problems, and arrange his schedule to be with her. He will gladly sacrifice his wants and needs to win her love. He will even tolerate her bad moods, rage attacks, addictions, and emotional or sexual unavailability -- all because he 'loves her so much'. On the surface it may appear that the enmeshing Nice Guy desires, but this is an illusion. The Nice Guy's pursuing and enmeshing behavior is an attempt to hook up an emotional hose to his partner. This hose is used to suck the life out of her and fill an empty place inside of him. The Nice Guy's partner unconsciously picks up on this agenda and works like hell to make sure the Nice Guy can't get close enough to hook up the hose. Consequently

The above excerpts accurately described me, be an attractive, assertive, and confident man. If you can't change your attitude on this, then you will not be able to rid yourself of your forever alone status. Do not sabotage yourself. Let yourself succeed.

I had an interesting experience this weekend when I decided to go golfing with my brother. Now, we were getting frustrated, and they didn't spread out the tee times well so we were constantly worrying about holding people up. We actually wound up skipping a hole because we were so worried that were were inconveniencing everyone.

After the front nine, and we both decided we were going to ""honey badger"" the last 9 holes. Furthermore, I made the suggestion that we should switch to irons only for the last 9, rather than use our drivers. The difference was like night and day. We had an absolute blast on the back 9, hit for nearly par on every hole, and had some of our best shots of the day. And even when the shots were bad, we still laughed about it and had a good time.

In hindsight, not someone else's. When you let someone else decide your emotions, they control you. It's also good to remember that sometimes, confidence can be found in doing what you do well. Maybe it's gaming, playing a sport, or even cooking. Everybody in the world is damn good at something.

Ok here we are! So first off
Are you back? Excellent. Good job by the way, but soon I expanded my outreach(get it?) to non-runners as well. Now if I see anyone heading towards me I look at them, smile, and offer a high-five. Why do I do that? Why not just run silently or throw out a simple ""howyoudoing"" ? Several reasons:
1) High-fiving people means that you have to take that extra step to be outgoing; to reach out to a complete strangers to greet them. 
2) Physical contact, simple because they think that the other person will reject them or think that they are weird, or heavens no, calls the police and yells rape or something. High-fiving people is a socially acceptable way to break the fear of physical contact with others. 
3) People LOVE it! Almost every person I offer a high-five to, and simply wave at me. A lot of times we miss. That usually happens with white people. (By the way if you are offended that I made a white people joke, it's ok, both my parents happen to be white, plus it's true.) 
4) It puts people outside of their comfort zone, the purpose of this exercise was to put me out of my comfort zone. That is no longer the case. I love watching people as I run up to them. I can read on their face and in their eyes the fear of social interaction. They're thinking ""Please just run by and don't say anything, pretend I'm not here. I'm just going to make myself as small as possible and scoot out of your way."" Nooooo way, sweet old lady! WE'RE HIGH-FIVING! And it's great for all parties involved. 9 people like that out of 10 get a smile on their face, even if they choose not to high-five. It's painless, it's friendly, and someone recognized them as a fellow human being instead of just another obstacle on the road. 
5) It actually give me a boost. I notice that I speed up just a little after I get a high-five. Weird
Here are some tips on high-fiving strangers when you run:
1) DO NOT scare people. 
2) Let them know ahead of time that you see them by making eye contact, I don't smile. Ever. 
3) Give them sufficient time to react to your high-five. Don't spring it on them at the last second. 
4) Announce the high-five loud enough for them to hear
5) Don't put your hand in their face. Respect personal space. Keep in mind you are running. You don't want to hit someone with the full running momentum.
6) Don't take it personal if they reject you. Some people will nod
7) Have fun. That's what it's all about. 

Now you might be thinking: ""It's so insignificant, just order a Big Mac at Subway or something. It was a huge step for me. My heart was pounding, I felt incredibly nervous, I almost chickened out. Now, pffft, whatever, I can even put on a show and demand to see a manager, first time- very nervous

1337709726.0,tzkud,"Go in expecting nothing, and you might come out with something. - [Dating for nice guys, Part 4]",,14,1, or easily available. 

I’ll start off with a personal story. It was the summer of 2008, moved to a new city, and enrolled in a summer class at the local university. I moved into a dorm-style housing complex, specially selected because it was filled with people from all different walks of life. The last thing I wanted was to get into another serious relationship. I met many interesting people that summer, girls and guys. Some of the guys expressed interest in me, but none of them interested me. There was one guy in particular who called me constantly, wrote things on the whiteboard outside my room, incredibly needy. Oh

Then there was this other guy. I’d met him early on in the summer, carefree attitude about him. The “I don’t really give a fuck about what you think about me” kind of attitude. He wasn’t rude at all, just independent and confident about himself. As the summer progressed, we saw each other sometimes in passing. At some point in time, we starting hanging out more with some friends we had in common. I got to know him better, and I knew he was the type of guy I could never have an actual relationship with. He had a reputation as a player, but it was unclear which girls he was actually sleeping with, but I could tell from the way he acted that he wouldn’t mind having, if not

Different variations of the same story have happened a few times in my life. When I was younger, I would never be happy in a long-term relationship with someone like that. Really liking someone who has no real interest in reciprocating your interest, besides to sleep with you, is a waste of time and the emotional fuckery that comes along with it is not worth it for me. I long ago adopted the attitude that if I’m into someone, and they’re not into me, it’s not worth my time to pursue it. I have difficulty understanding girls who pine over guys who give them the bare minimum of attention to keep them around. You know that book, “He’s Just Not That Into You”? I’ve loaned that book to a few of my girl friends. I only wish there was one called “She’s Just Not That Into You, and end up getting friend-zoned. 

Ironically, and have no intentions of having meaningful relationships with the women they have sex with. Doesn’t it suck that these same men are the ones who can get a women’s attention? While you, with the best of intentions, knowing you could be such a good partner to someone, gets passed over. Yeah.  

So this goes back to my point about being rare/less available. One of the things that can help with attraction is to create mystery, say there’s a shiny new Apple iThing out, and it’s a limited edition with only 50 available within 1000 miles of you. Imagine that this iThing only costs $20. The emphasis is not about the cost, it’s about how few of them are available. You really really want it. You line up for hours in the rain outside the Apple store, and you’re like the 49^th person in line. You end up getting one of these elusive things, and you’re elated. Now be honest, would you have liked that thing as much if there were millions available, but probably less likely. People like challenges. You woke up early

Now think of yourself as the iThing. Are you a limited edition, check in everyday at work to see if she wants to have lunch with you, pass by her desk a lot for no real reason, or stalk the whiteboard outside her dorm room? Or, if you’re at a bar, do you buy all her drinks, laugh at all her jokes, and compliment her endlessly? If so

So what are you supposed to do if you don’t try to get her attention all the time? Isn’t she going to just... not notice you? No. Make sure she knows you exist, but make sure it’s a real question you actually care about and think she can assist you in. (If you’re at a bar, the situation is a little trickier, because if you don’t say something to her, she might never notice you. A future post will talk about this, including a low-risk technique to start a conversation with a girl without being explicitly rejected.) As long as she has an idea of who you are, you’ve made a point already. Don’t shower her with endless attention. Be chill. Please, the girl is going to be like “Wow, but I have a feeling most do not. 

Sounds pretty easy, and she’s going to run into your arms. Sure, if you’re lucky. It might never happen. With the guy at the dorm, I totally could have decided that I didn’t want to have a fling with him. I might not have been attracted to him physically, or I only do serious relationships, or maybe I was saving myself for marriage. There could be a million reasons. *You have to be prepared for the possibility that she’s just not into you. Don’t take it personally.* Don’t overinvest in her, even if you’re secretly pining for her while attempting to act nonchalant. How do you do this? Well, that is enough.* If you tell yourself this and genuinely believe it, “I could have any one of these guys in an instant” (Happy Meals)

You’ve created mystery and a sense of the unknown by projecting that you don’t give two shits if she talks to you or not. The most important thing is you must genuinely train yourself not to care. *I am not here to find a relationship.* Be casual. See how it goes. If she’s interested, and maybe even made a new friend. Eventually, you will find someone who reciprocates your interest in a romantic way. In summary: Don’t expect to meet someone each time you go out. Go out to meet interesting people, not just women. Don’t overinvest in someone who is not invested in you. Most of all, just relax and be casual.

Anyway, you will see some results and improvement with your success with women.

I have seen it time and time again. Guys (and especially FAs here), my success with women really started to happen. Now before you take out pitchforks, I'm not advocating that you be an asshole. Quite the contrary. Just don't be needy. [Here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ryUU3gYi) is a real conversation I had with a female friend a few nights ago.

I think that conversation is great because it truly illustrates that girls don't want that needy guy. So here are some points to ponder:

* **Do not smother her**

* **Do not re-arrange your entire schedule just to be with her. She will pick up on this and it will come across as you not having a life and being needy. You have things to do? Priorities? Tell her that you need to schedule a better time to see each other because you have important things to take care of. *It's actually a good thing to be unavailable**

* **Do not feel that you need to talk to her every day. You don't. You are a busy man and you have important things to do in life.**

* **Do not feel like you need to buy her gifts all the time on seemingly random occasions. Believe it or not


Those points helped me the most

* Let her text you more than you text her.
* If she doesn't respond to your text for a few hours
* Do not do this: ""You free Friday night? No? Saturday night? No? How about Sunday? ...Monday? ...Tuesday? ...I'm actually free every single night so tell me when we can meet."" -- I have seen guys do this and it is painful to watch.
* Do not tell her that she is only one you are pursuing. She secretly wants to know that other girls are going after you too
* Do not cater to her every need. If you're in the middle of something and your crush calls you because she needs to cry about the latest guy who rejected her

[edit incase anyone looks at this so long after]

In the past I would get cold feet about going out to do stuff and I would just stay at home.  When I was invited to come out I was excited at first

I got to a bar I've never been to, so it was just her and her boyfriend, whom I'd met before.  To my good fortune, me and him hit it off pretty well.  

After I ordered a drink, music &gt; trip-hop, work, what part of town we live in, etc.)  She mentions to her boyfriend that she was ""trying to be friends with me for a long time but I was 'too professional' at work"".  After a while one of the birthday girl's friends shows up with her boyfriend who's younger and didn't talk so much.  Then three more girls show up  with another guy.  I couldn't really talk to the new girls because they were sitting right up behind me.  I tried to talk to the other guy, but unlike the boyfriend he wasn't really helping the conversation along.  We all decide it's getting too crowded in the corner we had claimed, and moved down the street to another bar.  

I make some chatter with the others at this bar, and more crowded than the other bar, it was like a tunnel to a hallway that connected to another bar and a nightclub.  Some girl recognized me because she was my sister's friend a long time ago, but I didn't remember her (and I still don't because I forgot her name).  

We move into the other bar, I haven't done that in so long).  Boyfriend and I head over to the 3 girls and the 2 other guys who're playing foosball.  As boyfriend leaves to go to the bathroom.  The guy who left earlier shows up, and I had met him a few times before, so I talk to him about music because he said he was working on putting some stuff together.  Then the b-day girl comes back kinda buzzed and thanks me for coming out and tells me she's not feeling tipsy, and so I buy her a shot.  We meet up with boyfriend and she gets her camera out and starts taking pictures with everyone.  After my pic I get pulled over to the foosball table for a game.  I'm kinda buzzed at this point, but I was taking it easy because I didn't want to get stupid drunk.  We have fun with the game, but we couldn't tell who one because only half the score counters were still there.

End up chatting with the guy that left earlier, apparently he left soon after and nobody stayed so b-day girl ended up crying because she couldn't find anyone not even her boyfriend and there's this guy who's talking to her when we find her.  So boyfriend comes up, we kinda push the other guy away and he starts complaining about not being appreciated.

We're waiting for b-day girl and boyfriend to finish their drama while the one guy eats his hot dog.  We were gonna go to hot-dog guy's house



I don't normally go out like that, but whatever.  I went out there, that's what matters, and I was actually able to get so far as to have someone say they want to hang out with me.

At friend's get togethers and things like that where you do get to meet new people, when I probably should because I wouldn't know how, and I convince myself that it wouldn't be mutual. Again, the guilt kicks in that I'd be appearing misogynistic concerned that they'd be thinking I'm hitting on them and being a creep. So they just become another friend or acquaintance rather than being seen as a potential dating partner or w/e. I tried once asking someone I became friendly with out shortly after I met them, but it didn't happen. (long story) We're good friends now and I got over the whole romantically interested thing quickly which there was no point in dwelling over.

Even elsewhere when I'm out alone in a shop or cafe or something. *Sees someone attractive. Doesn't talk to them.* Same reasons as above. But also kind of to do with the fact I'm not the type of person to randomly strike up a conversation with anyone.

&gt;Her: I know! I'm so happy. Not sure what's going to happen

&gt;Me: Yeah

&gt;Her: You're getting better. You're such a great catch. It's only a matter of time.

This is called reaction-seeking and seeking external validation. While not even aware of it at the time, I don't think I'll be so lucky"" was essentially baiting her to say something nice about me. This is awfully unattractive in a man. Avoid making statements like these in the future. **You don't need a girl's validation to make yourself feel better**

This book

Perhaps you have been working toward some financial goal, full, successful. You feel great. You come home to your woman and want to share the news with her.

""I just made a million dollars today""

""That's nice""

""That's nice?!?! You know how hard I've been working for this.""

""I know. It feels like I haven't seen you in months. Did you remember to pick up the milk on the way home?""

""Oh

""I asked you to pick up the milk three times this morning

""I said I'm sorry. Look

Why is she being this way? Because she simply wants to deflate your success? No. She is challenging you because your success doesn't mean shit to her, so she pokes you in your weak spot.

Of course she knows how much this moment of success means to you. This is precisely why she is negating it. Not because she wants to hurt you. But because she wants to feel Shiva (the divine masculine: imperturbable, and all-pervading). She wants to feel your strength. She wants to feel that your happiness is not dependent on her response, nor on you making a million dollars. She wants to feel you are a superior man.

It's a tall order to be this free, then you will want her to test you. You may not like it. But you don't want her to settle for some bozo who depends on his woman's response to be happy. If you are aligned with your mission, you are essentially happy, even through times cycle between difficult and easy. You don't need your woman's strokes to fulfill your mission. It still feels good when she strokes you, but you don't need mommy anymore, telling you what a good boy you are. And your woman doesn't want you to need mommy. In fact, it sickens her.

If your woman is weak, a strong woman, she won't tolerate your childish needs for a pat on the head, collecting bigger toys, and being king of the mountain. A good woman will love the childlike part of you, but she wants your life to be guided by your deepest truths, not your untended childhood wounds. She wants to feel that at your core you have grown beyond the need for kudos and million-dollar toys. She wants to feel your self-generated strength of truth.

So she will test you. She might not be fully conscious of why she is doing it, in order to feel your strength. If you collapse, you've flunked the test. You have let your woman deflate you. You have demonstrated your dependence on her for external validation. Even if you just made a million dollars, you are a weak man. Your woman cannot trust you fully.

If you remain full and strong, then you pass the test.

**Christmas Eve** -- I went out alone (what? how?). I'm Jewish and I found out a few days before that there is something called a Matzo Ball where a good number of people show up at the bar / club and have a great time. So I went there alone with 0 expectations, she was dancing with this guy and then made out with him.... I get into a bad frame of mind and actually leave the club to go home. I get 3 blocks away. Stop. Turn around and go back inside. I walk past the girl who was still dancing with the guy. I made eye contact with her, and I could tell something was off. Then I pulled the ballsiest move of my entire life. I walked over to the guy, tapped him on the shoulder, introduced myself and shook his hand. He just 'knew' ...and walked off. The girl tells me, ""You just saved me so much, you have no idea."" ...I never felt more confident in my life. We kissed. She lives 500 miles away so I never saw her again.

**New Years Eve** -- I really liked this girl a lot 2 years ago. Big crush on her. I did what every Forever Alone Guy does and after six months I told her how I really felt about her (by the way, and is described in the book in Step 1 as a self-sabotage technique). She responds verbatim, ""You'll get over it.""

Ouch.

Rarely speak to her, so I felt comfortable talking to her. We both acknowledge we're still single. We catch up a little bit and talk. The party goes on and every now and then we'd run into each other and talk some more. It was a good time. Then it comes time for the ball drop and we're just standing next to each other while everyone else has someone to kiss. When the ball drops, I just turn her around to face me, and we had an awesome kiss. We pause, look at each other, and then kiss again. We sat on the couch holding hands, leaning on each other and then we kissed again when I had to leave at the end of the night.

Again, but it felt great to overcome what was 2 years in the making.

**Patriots vs. Broncos Playoff Game --** Last night I went out alone (I try to make it a theme in many of my stories that going out alone is totally cool and you can still have a great night). So I show up at this bar and start talking to a bunch of the guys there. Real chill guys

Night goes on, but it was getting late and I'd been there for 4+ hours. My leg was hurting and I just wanted to go home already so I told her I had to leave, but that I had to get a kiss first. She said no. So I said, ""why not?"" She responds, ""Cause you're being lame and leaving early!"" with a playful face. I can tell she didn't want me to leave. We kissed. I texted her when I got back and she wants to see me again! Who knows what'll happen!

I'm hoping that this post will help you understand others and to realize that there are many people in the same situation as you even if they don't have the flaws that you THINK you have and you THINK are debilitating to your social life.     
I had a phone conversation with a very, allow me to take a step back and tell you a little about my friend. She is a very gorgeous girl. A firery hot Russian read-head(seriously, she freaking looks like Scarlet Johanson from Avengers). Guys flock to her in droves and she literally can have any guy she wants. ""Good for her"" you might grumble bitterly ""she's one of *those* girls"", but no, not so. While yes, she is almost never without a boyfriend, they never stick around for long. They all seem to want her for her body, and nobody wants to connect with her and actually know her for who she is. And even many of her friends quickly disappear.  That leaves her feeling empty, are familiar with.       
Now the thing is, not weird in a bad way), just like everyone here isn't. Here is the actual email my friend send me, see if you can relate:

the other day.. Unfortunately i can't remember the exact way I said
everything but I will do my best. I hope it helps.

I remember I told you that sometimes I feel like i don't connect with
people and the other day
just me
other human beings and still feel like i could find nothing to say or
how to begin a conversation... I can't really relate to all the
trivial stuff.. the jokes which i don't understand.. the moments that
i try to but fall flat because no one picks up on my humor... I feel
not funnny and dumb.. But then I remembered about the few people I
have that I trully connect with
you... laughing ridiculously and having plenty to talk about
regardless of how much time i spend with you... and I realized that it
wasn't me... I can connect with people and not just can
it's just that others sometimes don't want to connect with me.. And it
makes me sad.. makes me feel so alone..  I know i don't allways trust
people
by past friends
most of all
that once i show people who I am
will be discusted and walk away.. I just want a group of friends I
feel close to.. people I trust
for a long time
fall
connected and to care about others
people who laugh at my jokes and make their own with me.. people who
suround me and make me feel funny and relaxed
deep conversation with

talk to people... and not be so set appart... But here i am...

Remember, which I strongly recommend for everybody! And, inspired by my dancing earlier, joined a break-dancing group at that parkour gym(seriously, that place is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious with a side of kick-ass!) and after only one class and literally learning only two break-dance moves, I bravely walked out onto the floor for the group jam session and did the best I could. And apparently I did pretty good, as they were fairly impressed. According to one of the guys, I guess. Minor side note: I asked a girl out at that gym. She wouldn't give me her number, because...   
…I've been thinking of ways to ""speed number-close"". It's a challenge to see how fast you can get a girl's number. So far my best time is 10 seconds. This is a very simple move and that move is just smoooooooth-criminal, I'll take your number!” and give her the best Hollywood smile you can do. Works wonderfully! In part because it takes them a second to process and when they do, they realize what happened and it breaks up the monotony their of work and it makes them smile. I used this line at Hooters yesterday and our waitress actually said “Sure, I'll be right back!” and started walking away before she realized what I asked. She turned around with a huge smile and slight shock and accusingly said “You!..”. I knew I was caught, so I jokingly stuck out my tongue and laughed. I didn't get her number, but I did make her smile and got to talk and joke with a couple of other waitresses there, and I think they might have remembered me. Plus it worked for me before
But wait! There's more! Yesterday me and my friend(Jeesus) went out for Veterans Day. Both of us being veterans(me- Iraq, handing out roses to all the women we saw. We called it “Veterans Day Rose” event. It was spectacular! Most women simply lit up! Some didn't want them. One woman offended us. She accused us of trying to collect donations. Anyway our first run was so successful that we went and bought four more dozen and walked different streets of Richmond, closer to VCU. We ran into a group of sorority girls. Two dashingly handsome soldiers in uniform on Veterans Day handing out roses to sorority girls...Needless to say a new tradition was born. For those of you that a curious: nothing special happened, I exchanged numbers with a couple of girls, told them to call me and off we went onto another adventure, as we were running late for a previously planned engagement, which ultimately landed us at Hooters later that night.

[Dating for nice guys: Part 6](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/blackballon/journal/1552056309044839928/Dating-for-nice-guys:-Part-6)

May 5

**2 types of ""safe"" guys

I want to clarify that there are two types of safe guys. I think I’ve been focusing mostly on the more extreme types of safe guys in my examples, but who also don’t have a high success rate of attracting women.

*Type 1: Extreme-Safe Nice Guys*

Guys who are like Ty in [Part 2](http://redd.it/tzgh9) of the posts - the type of guy who sinks into a puddle of depression if he’s not in a relationship

*Type 2: Regular-Safe Nice Guys*

Guys who feel okay being single most of the time, or someone they’ve met through mutual friends. They probably like girls who possess at least some inkling of intelligence, and are not really attracted to the shit-for-brains type. I know lots of guys like this, and they come in every variety. Most of them are really intelligent and successful in their careers, but can’t recreate that same success with women. Your average regular-safe guy has probably had either none, or a small number of girlfriends in the past, but is far more likely to get friend-zoned. I feel like these are the guys who might benefit most from the advice I’m giving. You’re not clueless

In addition to the other stuff I’ve written that you can do to try to accomplish this

I said this in a previous post: “I don’t know why guys think that if they show tons and tons of interest, but unfortunately it doesn’t work that way.” Since then, I’ve thought more about this. It really lies in the logic part. If you’re a naturally logical person (which many people are, and especially engineers or similar), then what you’ve been doing to attract women actually makes perfect sense. Pretty much everything else in life works well when you think about it in that way, right?

Examples:

1) You’re trying to get a promotion at work. You put in tons of effort, go above and beyond. If your boss values your work ethic and and appreciates what you’re doing, you’ll probably eventually get rewarded with a raise or a nice year-end bonus or something. You work hard so you get rewarded. Makes sense.

2) You’re trying to get a good grade in your class. You go to all the classes, form a group to study with, write draft after draft so you can write the best paper possible. You get an A in the class. Very understandable.

3) You wait tables at a restaurant. You take orders quickly, and you have a positive attitude towards your customers. At the end of each shift, you make a lot more than your fellow co-worker with the pissy attitude who largely ignores his or her tables. It doesn’t surprise anyone that you get better tips. It makes perfect sense. It’s… logical.

Okay

4) You meet a girl at a party your friend is having. She’s pretty and smart, and you guys say something about adding each other on Facebook. The next day, you add her and write her a message saying how nice it was to meet her. She responds after a day or two and says it was nice to meet you too. You’re very encouraged by this and think that’s a good sign. You send her another message. She takes longer to respond, like say 3 days or something. You respond immediately. She doesn’t respond. Maybe she didn’t see it? You send her another one, jokingly asking if she’s still alive. No reply. What happened here? You got too predictable, easy, safe

Logically, make it known to her that you’re very interested, and you SHOULD get that promotion/A grade/big tip/her. Sorry folks, doesn’t work that way. Less is more. Keep that mystery happening. I’m not going to rehash everything I’ve written in the other posts or it'll just get really repetitive, but just realize that what feels right to you naturally is probably working against you with women.

The end.",,t5_2tav6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/u1bvy/two_types_of_safe_guys_and_why_logic_doesnt_work/

Apr 13

**What you shouldn't do if she breaks up with you.**

*Quick vocab lesson if you didn’t read the [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/txjxz/safe_guys_vs_unsafe_guys_dating_for_nice_guys) about nice guys:*

*""Safe"" - Predictable, eager to please, very sweet. The type of guy you'd want to have a family with - good father, dependable, doesn't cheat, etc. The type of guy who often ends up in the friend zone.*

*""Unsafe"". It's about being your own person. Not being needy, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you. Someone who doesn't need a lot of validation from others and has an ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude.*

I’ve been thinking about what I wrote yesterday about nice guys and dating, if a relationship doesn’t work out.

An example: I have this friend on Facebook, Ty had never been in a relationship before. He was the embodiment of a “safe” guy. Fast forward 6 months or so, and he’s met a girl. She’s substantially more attractive than he is, and is the type of girl who likes to post photos of herself posing in midriff tops and bikinis. Every other day or so, Ty would update his status saying how much he loves this girl, how this is the happiest he’s ever been, and how waking up to her beautiful face was the best part of his day. I’m thinking, this is not going to end well if they break up.”

The relationship lasts for about a year. She breaks up with him. How do I know? Because now every day there is a new status update about how he can’t stop thinking about her, which means she can read them. This goes on for months, and includes a status update saying that the girl already has another boyfriend. I feel sorry for Ty. I can tell he’s a good person with many friends who care about him because people are posting on his wall, trying to give him advice, and offering to talk to him on the phone if he needs it.

If I knew this guy better, and it could have killed the attraction. Of course, I don’t know the whole story and I’m speculating, but I’m going on what I know about girls in general. Girls I know don’t like it when a guy is so into her that he gives up a part of himself and would completely lose it if she broke up with him. It’s like a guy cutting off his own balls and handing them to the girl. The relationship becomes incredibly mundane, predictable, and it’s just like, “Do you really have that little autonomy that everything you do, is dependent on me?”

That is not healthy, being independent, being self-assured, making your own decisions, and not caring so much about what other people think about you). If Ty exhibited some unsafe characteristics, the relationship might have stood a chance, and even if it didn’t

If you feel like a girl you’re dating is pulling away, tell her how much you love her and can’t live without her, and hope she understands how you feel and will take you back. If she’s already lost her attraction to you, this will only drive her further away. If she hasn’t, it probably will. It’s just too much. It’s giving her power that she doesn’t want. It’s annoying her and she’s probably texting her girlfriends saying things like “he won’t leave me alone.” The next thing you know, she’s moved on.

The second thing you can do is to take a step back. Respect her space, reassess. What went wrong in the relationship? Sometimes people are just incompatible, and that’s okay. Maybe you didn’t do anything wrong. Maybe she’s just ready to move on to another chapter in her life, one that doesn’t include you. It could be a million reasons, but at this point in time, it’s not really in your control. If you suspect early on that she’s losing interest, it’s possible that you became too safe and she started losing her attraction to you. So what can you do?

You give her space, or b) she’s over the relationship by this time already and leaves/never calls you. If she wants to be with you, she will find a way to contact you.

If she leaves, you work on yourself, work at developing more unsafe characteristics into your personality, and if that relationship doesn’t work out, you know what? You’ll be okay, because you are your own god damn person who does not need to give all your power to a girl to feel good about yourself. Continue until you find someone you want to be with forever (if that’s your end goal). It doesn’t have to end like Ty’s story each time.",,,,

[Well, I asked the cute girl I've been sitting next to for the last few weeks if she'd like to go on a date with me. Her answer, without hesitation: ""Sure!"" She has family obligations the next two weekends, but we're on for the Saturday after that.

I know there will be skeptics who will just point at the part about her having ""family obligations"" as just being an excuse to get out of it—I sure as heck would be one of them. But, and she again said yes without hesitation. The paranoid, cynical FA in me still says ""oh, that's plenty of time for her to change her mind and back out,"" but if she's still willingly sitting next to me in class and cool with making awkward small talk after almost a month of this, there's at least a better chance than usual that her reply was genuine.

Some of the best advice in the comments on my original post were to not wait around, that waiting longer leads to a higher chance of friend-zoning, and that's absolutely true. Again, time will tell what ends up happening in this story, but I will be sure to update again as things progress—I owe it to y'all; without your encouragement

Now, and even more shockingly, with a girl that I find quite attractive. Last Friday, I was chatting with my friend, let's call her Darlene. We became good friends last year. This year Darlene is living in an on-campus house with another girl, let's call her Agatha. 

Now Agatha was always someone that I had admired from afar, and had the occasional chat, but nothing more.

As Darlene and I are talking, and somehow we agree to all hang out later.

Later, but the cops bust it an hour in. She and I sit and chat outside for a while, and we eventually go back to her house. We watched a movie and I wound up sleeping on their couch. 

I had previously made plans for the morrow, though, I completely space and don't ask her for her number. 

The weekend passes, and Tuesday.

On Wednesday I get out of class, and we hang out for SIX HOURS. We get high and laugh at random videos, then we decide to watch a movie. 

During the movie I am trying to touch her

The movie ends and we just stay like that for a while. 

Then she asks if I'll give her a back rub. 

Within minutes she is laying on me. I am holding her in my arms on the couch

I know I am supposed to kiss her. After years of struggling with that fact, but I know I have to do this.

But I don't.

It ends fine, and I mumble something about hanging out on Friday. Then I leave.

That's the story. Does anyone have a piece of advice or encouragement for me?

EDIT: This is what happened. I posted this and went to class. After class I read these comments, dancing around specifics. He reinforced the idea that I couldn't just receive her physical energy without sending some her way in return. Then another person there, casually eavesdropping, dropped this bombshell: 'Think of the most ludicrous action you could take that applies to your situation, then you should probably do that thing.' That's roughly paraphrased. But all of a sudden I was walking to her house. While walking I texted to her to see if she was even there. She was, and that I should drop by. When I got there, Darlene was outside talking on her phone. I went in, but pleasantly so. I went in and sat down in an empty chair facing her. I had some idea of a sentence but it came out garbled. The driving idea behind everything was that I was stupid for not kissing her. What I said was 'So I was being stupid the other night.' She looked at me and said, 'I'm sorry but I think I......kiss you.' I can't remember it but I know I said the word 'kiss.' Then I was kissing her. It was............I think she liked it. I don't know what I was doing. We switched sides one time. I broke away and said something like 'Um.' I can't recall what she said, and we hugged for a while

Apr 30

**How to figure out if the friend you like actually likes you back**

You know that girl you like? The one you see at work/have the same class with but you’re just friends? You want it to be more

**Give two options and be casual when asking her out.** Her choices will give you a clearer answer.

*An example of one option:*

You: “Kate

Her: “Umm

[Awkward]

**or**

*An example of two options:*

You: “Kate

Her: “I have a lot of work to do this weekend but yeah

[Not interested

Obviously Kate really could have a lot of work to do that weekend, or school, or something else going on, it’s pretty clear that she doesn’t really want to do anything with just you. You guys can stay friends without directly having the weird “are we just friends or something more” talk.

*Another example

You: “Kate

Her: “Yeah sounds good

[Not interested

If she's interested

You: “Kate

Her: “Yeah

Ah, does that mean she’s into me?” No, not necessarily. It’s hard to tell from just one incident. Keep trying the same thing in different scenarios and see if it’s consistent. If she’s always responding that she always wants to just do stuff with you alone, it’s promising.

If you've been reading all this and think ""holy fucking crap, it's effortless. It works beautifully. I do it whenever I need to ask someone something where I'm very unsure that the response will be. It's usually with people I don't know very well. Truthfully, I didn't even know WHAT exactly I was doing until recently, when I consciously thought about it and pegged it as ""two options"". If it comes out naturally the other person will have no idea, and even if they do realize, there is no harm done because it's not manipulative or malicious.

Good luck!

Tonight, and that my presence was dragging down everyone else's enjoyment of the evening. I sat there, politely laughing at all of my friends' comments, had a single drink, then came back. The whole time, I hated myself so much. I couldn't bear to be myself. The girl I really like was there with us and I didn't even say a word to her. But I guess I know that this isn't really about girls or wanting to be accepted by my friends or whatever; it's about me and how I feel about myself.



This had been happening for a very long time; much longer than anyone else realises. Once upon a time, I'm a sad, lonely, negative person, who doesn't like himself. Was it the case that I'd never really been happy, but was merely pretending? It doesn't matter. My original intention here was to list every single sob story of my life, mope around for a couple hours, because really



Thank God (I'm not religious, I thought it was going to be the usual back-patting and wound-licking that I've resorted myself to far too many times whenever I've been down and depressed. I realise that it's the complete opposite now. We're all here not because we hate ourselves, but because we care about ourselves and want to learn to love and respect ourselves.



From this moment on, ""starting on a fresh page"" every once in a while, and hoping for my life to get magically better. Tonight, I'm going to bed only thinking about the positive things in my life. I have a seriously great group of friends, whom I will start trusting more. I love my family, despite how much I like to think that my familial relations are dysfunctional. I am fairly intelligent, and I will do well at university, I am not that bad-looking, not at me. There isn't any solid reason in my life for me to feel crap about.



Tomorrow, I will meet up with one of my best friends (whom I saw earlier tonight) to tell him about my situation, my desire for self-improvement, and ask for his support. Then I'm going to do my student radio show, with another good friend of mine. When my schedule is over, I will still be a single guy on Valentine's Day, but I won't care. I'm going to meet up with my friends, and have a good time!



I don't care if no one reads this all the way through; I don't expect anyone to. I'm sorry that a lot of this might be incoherent to anyone but me. But this is meant to be my oath to myself. I will not fail. To everyone else who wants their life to get better - I'm going to do this



Tl;dr - I feel shit and have been feeling that way for quite some time. I'm going to work to get better. Let's do this.

Reducing the intensity of this need would be a good thing. I'm not saying I want to not care about being social so I can stay FA. The intensity actually makes socializing harder and contributes to keeping me FA. Feeling bad from not socializing makes it hard to start socializing

Yesterday, exercised in the gym for about an hour (cardio and lifting), started reading a book I’ve been putting off, went to a bar alone, and tried to initiate a conversation with the attractive bartender.  At the end of the day I felt great about changing up my typical nightly routine … but today after work I didn’t feel like doing any of that. My brain told me “you should just sit on Reddit and Facebook all night like usual”.  I didn’t listen to my scumbag brain – I exercised for an hour and went out to a bar again.  It feels much better breaking out of the typical nightly routine.

My point is that it took me 24 years to realize it, and it takes a strong willpower to change all that. Of course we can save that debate for a different subreddit. Thanks to Shakedown_St for all the resources you’ve created, they’ve really helped to change my outlook on life for the better.  May we all have a brighter 2013 to look forward to and continue the improvement process!

There's one thing from the book which is confusing me though. Quoting the book:

&gt; Breaking Free Activity #4

&gt; I've taken surveys in several No More Mr. Nice Guy! groups asking the members about the 

&gt; attachments they use to try to get external approval. The following are just a few of the responses. 

&gt; Look over the list. Note any of the ways in which you seek approval. Add to the list any behaviors 

&gt; that are uniquely you. Write down examples of each. Ask others for feedback about the ways in 

&gt; which they see you seeking approval. 

&gt; G     Having one's hair just right. 

&gt; G     Being smart. 

&gt; G     Having a pleasant

&gt; G     Looking unselfish. 

&gt; G     Being different from other men. 

&gt; G     Staying sober. 

&gt; G     Being in good shape. 

&gt; G     Being a great dancer. 

&gt; G     Being a good lover. 

&gt; G     Never getting angry. 

&gt; G     Making other people happy. 

&gt; G     Being a good worker. 

&gt; G     Having a clean car. 

&gt; G     Dressing well. 

&gt; G     Being nice. 

&gt; G     Respecting women. 

&gt; G     Never offending anyone. 

&gt; G     Looking like a good father.

While some activities from the list are clearly pure approval-seeking, ""Being in good shape"", etc. which I don't completely understand. For instance, the main reason I dress well is because it helps me accomplish my own interests, particularly by being more attractive to other people, which should help me to meet friends and women. But this can be seen in some way as approval-seeking, i.e. I'm dressing well because I want people to think of me as an attractive

What do you think about it? Is there something wrong with my mindset?

Also always being the odd man out and knowing that once they decide to head off somewhere else, you'll just be stuck there alone again. That's a bad feel.

Another problem with going out alone are the men. I don't know how many times I've had to leave a place and head home just because some guy starts following me around. You wouldn't guess what a few beers does to a man's capacity of understanding the word ""no"" on the first try.

The girls that actually show they like me don't usually speak English very well. I'm pretty sure I've messaged every girl in my city, so I've given online dating a break.

So I went to this bar yesterday with a few friends. We go inside, and it doesn't work out.... I pass.  

My friends approach to meeting women at the bar is to say ""Hey how's it going?"" right as they turn a corner or open a door. Women don't like this. They are usually shocked and then just ignore him. I never had the heart to tell him that its kinda creepy

My approach is to try and make eye contact with a girl and smile. You can usually gauge if a persons into you that way. Problem is

I'm really good at one-on-one conversations with girls (well I have my good and bad days) but have never had a normal kiss or held hands with a boy or been asked out or anything. Never had an emotional connection with a guy or been in a relationship (obviously).

According to the OKCupid mirror thing, guys way out of my league started tagging me with positive comments and I met a guy on there. I got a bunch of messages, some were just normal conversations while others where overly sexual. It just felt so overwhelming and I felt gross doing it. But something strikes me as odd about the guy I had the easiest time talking to, he called me by name in every message and sent me several messages a day when I didn't respond. He seems overly forward, aggressive even but he hides it with a ton of smileys. I don't even know if we have anything in common so he's most likely just messaging me because of what I look like. The others I just felt overwhelmed messaging and sometimes inadequate, etc.. I go back and forth between feeling like the most hideous creature on earth to feeling really good about myself. When I start feeling bad about myself I feel ashamed of myself for having ever liked my looks. Plus I never really thought I'd ever get used by guys considering how I used to see myself but now I'm so paranoid about that.

Now I feel good about myself most of the time and like the other day, he always avoided me. During the speech I had laughed and was kind of nervous but joked about being nervous. So it's like I was connecting with the audience, but I can never do that with guys or normal groups. In groups I smile awkwardly and am silent. But he smiled so genuinely at me, everybody did, and it was like the guy was about to say something but even though I had a crush on him I just panicked and smiled slightly and walked past him super quickly. This happens all the time. I'm so inexperienced so that makes me nervous too. I never know what the fuck I'm doing.

Having a clean living space encourages you to be productive on improving yourself, and opens up the possibility of inviting people over to hangout whenever you feel like it.

My main problem is getting in that ""frame of mind""...That zone. I've gone out alone the last couple of nights and I just couldn't get in the zone. But I do know, invincible, and can make *anything* happen. I figure, there must be other guys out there like me looking to have wingmen and help each other out.

I went on meetup.com yesterday and sure enough, you know the deal.

So I show up, cafes, food courts, super markets, that kind of stuff. Another coach specializes in ""same-day-lays"". I was more interested in the day-game coach because I'm looking for a serious relationship. The other guy was just slay and move on. Not for me. There even was a female coach there who apparently coaches men. She does it by approaching a group of girls, complementing them on what they're wearing, etc..It's easy for girls  to do that and start a conversation. Then she will say, have you met my friend so and so. He's super cool."" and then the guy is in. My problem with this is

So I stuck with the day-game coach, balding, Jewish guy. You would never even think he was a dating coach or pick up artist, but he knows his shit. He specializes in body language, and..as you know from this subreddit, I am HUGE on body language so the two of us hit it off on that. We also found out we had a mutual friend in common, so that was cool too.

Anyway, I have little or 0 approach anxiety. I open with my toothpaste opener and get everyone involved. After a little while, I realize that one of the girls and I in the group knew each other from a while back which let me tell a funny story. I had everyone laughing and I was doing great. In the corner of my eye I saw the coach and one of the other students watching my interaction.

It went great and I ended up giving my contact details to one of the girls I was interested. I screwed up because I should have gotten her contact details

So that was that. I'll see what comes of this meetup group. I'm wary because if you get a coach

I highly recommend checking out if there's a local group near you. PM me if you have any questions.

Just to give a little background on myself. I always had a couple good friends growing up but never had any success with the ladies. Although I had recognized my lacking social abilities some time before, socializing in more settings and holding good conversation. Making and strengthening friendships became a lot easier. Still, I had no success with the fairer sex to speak of. However, towards the end of college, at age 21, I finally entered my first relationship and had my first everything. Now, two years later: I've seen two relationships come ago, have increased my dating skills significantly and have a bright outlook on the future. This wasn't because of luck

Now, *she just likes you as a friend*. This is the dreaded 'Friend Zone' which you might be all too familiar with. Forever alone or not, *lack of mutual feelings sucks for everyone but there's generally little or nothing you can do to change someone's mind*.

This, in retrospect, I'm certainly happy that I decided to find out. The following summarizes key benefits that I found with my best female friend as well as others who followed. All of this will generally be more effective with girls who aren't ""one of the guys"".

**You'll get much more comfortable around women.** This is something that I certainly struggled with before. Not quite social anxiety

**You will get a lot better at social interactions with women.** Generally, this is not a case of one-size-fits-all. *You need a different approach with women, socially.* This is not something that someone can easily teach you since it will certainly vary by personality. It really comes through experience which a platonic female friend is more than capable of providing. You'll start to realize how you should direct conversation, what you should talk about and how best to express yourself. 

**You learn a lot about boundaries.** There are certain things you can say or do that will never help you in any context. These are things that you might have the hardest time recognizing but that a female friend could identify instantly. If you ask for honest feedback on these things then you'll likely receive it. Then there's the topic of friendly teasing. The pick up artists like to call it ""negging"" but this is simply something people naturally do when they get more comfortable around each other regardless of gender. You wouldn't make the same jokes between strangers as you do between friends. Obviously, yet again, this is something that you can come to better understand through experience with a female friend.

**You get useful advice and feedback.** On your sense of fashion, etc. You'll hear the good, the bad and the ugly. *You'll have a better sense of how you are perceived by women and why*. This is really a goldmine for self-improvement.

**Wing-women are valuable.** Even fairly inexperienced wing-women can be more helpful than moderately experienced wing-man. Women bring a certain level of comfort to each other. It makes you instantly seem less creepy and more desirable. I haven't had the experience yet

Well there you have it, it provides a good path out of forever alone.

Halfway through last semester, and emotionally attached in the long distance relationship, and we had an emotionally draining breakup that left me depressed with no self-respect.

As the title says, and I live in Kansas City, Missorui. The same town I was born in, but not the same place. My hobbies are writing, singing, and martial arts. I know that I am an excellent writer, and when I write creativity flows through me. I also know that I am an excellent singer, not through personal preference - other people tend to tell me I am an amazing singer, as excellent a condition a 120 pound skinny and nerdy kid can be.) i personally spend much of my time studying quantum physics, and have since taken various IQ tests

I do in fact know the roots of my self-esteem problems. Ever since I was 6, I never had any chance to make any sort of friends anywhere- maybe some short lasting friendships, but never something long and meaningful. At the age of 12 my mother married a man who had three children of his own. The oldest one was abusive and would repeatedly hit me and call me ugly. I found out a year ago he sexually molestead the other two children. Luckily that never happened to me, but because of it i have had some self esteem issues when looking in the mirror. I have since only realized (about 3 months ago) that by most peoples standards I am actually quite handsome? I still can never tell myself, but a lot of people recently have made some comments that have made me realize I am not the ugly monster I once thought myself as. So, basically, I have always been a social recluse and always considered myself ugly and untalented, and have been chronically depressed (for years) until recently. This is obviously not my whole life's story, world weary. I am still quite depressed, the thing that I really long for - is love. I have never had a girlfriend. Hell

1351424238.0,127rvs,"So, I apparently should submit this here. Sick of being FA, and want to get better? Here's my suggestion.",DerbyWidow,9,2

Firstly, geek perspective. But this does not **just** apply to us. It applies to everyone. XX or XY. 

Here's the TL;DR: Roller Derby. 

I'm not implying that Roller Derby is a place to meet piles of hot girls (which, but that's not the point - most of them will probably already be taken). The point is to find a way to actually be able to communicate with people of the opposite sex like a reasonably coherent human being. 

Roller Derby is springing up pretty much everywhere. The odds are that you will have a group in your area - no matter where it is. Google something like '[your location] roller derby'. There'll be anything from a small facebook group

Found some? Sweet. Go watch some Roller Derby on youtube.  It's fun to watch

So now you know a bit about Roller Derby. Rock up to your closest league and say something like 'I've watched some roller derby on YouTube

By saying those magic words

Of course, you won't have to skate. There's an entire group of Roller Derby called NSOs - Non Skating Officials. These are the ones that manage the penalties, run around inside the track, organise bouts and run the scoreboard (and geeks - this is where I'm looking at you. We can do this stuff with our eyes closed. It's easy. But it's black magic to a group of girls who are competent in Excel and Access at work, but wouldn't know a .jar if it stabbed them in the eye).

So rock up. Keep rocking up. Help out. Be useful. Feel free to be shy. Don't pretend to be someone you aren't.  But

However, cry on your shoulder, and vomit on your shoes. 

That. Is. The. Trick. 

At some point in the not too distant future, and all the other girls in the bar are going to be looking at YOU.   'What has this guy got going for him?' they'll be asking themselves. 'All these other girls seem totally happy to be around him'. 

And you're going to be SO USED to talking to 'hot' girls in a social setting

OK. It's not that easy. I'm lying a bit. But that's the idea. You need to be comfortable talking to women. They're not some magical creature that you look up to.  They're people. 

And after you've been there for a while, and adjusting their aim.

Hey, if you're not a geek, you're their pet DJ. Or their always-there penalty tracker. Or just someone they can rely on to turn up and help out) They want to keep you happy.  You run their scoreboard. Or DJ their bout. Or video it. Or run their website. Or run around doing any of a million other things that we find easy, that baffles other people.

Or, and watched some Roller Derby on YT and gone 'wow, that DOES look like fun. I get to beat other chicks up? And then go out drinking with them? AWESOME!'. Rock up. Ask to join Fresh Meat. If you're not interested in Skating, you can NSO too. There's always room for one more. And your friendship circle will immediately expand. You have a bunch of sisters that love you, will cry on your shoulder, and let you cry on theirs.

(Re-reading this, and the social aspects of it make it awesome for developing human contact skills)

So here's the summary.  Meet hot chicks that you KNOW are out of bounds. Don't even try. Help out. Be useful. Be nice. It doesn't matter if you're 200kg

Once you're comfortable with this (and, like hammering a nail, or riding a bike) it's no longer challenging. And it's not a HARD skill, just a skill you need practice with. Sure you may have bent the first hundred or so nails you tried to hammer in. But after that, it's easy. You may have fallen off that bike 20 or 30 times before you learned to ride it without training wheels. 

Now it's not an issue talking to a random girl. Hey

And, may I offer one derby-specific piece of advice. They all talk about each other. They all bitch about each other. If someone tells you something, it stays with you. Don't share it with anyone else. Just because the girl said that to you 5 minutes ago, it doesn't mean she's feeling that way now. Always respond neutrally. Never take sides. The girl A that told you she hated girl B? Actually, she's best friends with B, and if B hears that A hates her, she's going to know who blabbed. And suddenly you're branded a gossiper. (Note that this applies to EVERYWHERE. But I thought I'd sneak it in here

And let me emphasize this once more. The Derby Girls are not for hooking up with. They are there purely for YOUR training purposes.  The best kind of deal has both people in front, because they have someone who can effortlessly build them a website, organise their scoring, or video their bouts and stick it on youtube for them.  If you can't do any of those things, you can be the person that is there whenever they need help, doing whatever needs to be done  You pay the price of being THEIR bitch, in order to make them YOUR bitches.

This week has had it's ups and downs. I failed on working out, and then to Maryland for work).

Besides that though

Wednesday &amp; Thursday: Traveled to Maryland for work, so that was great). I also found out on this day that my younger sister wouldn't be able to accompany me to an event I had already purchased tickets for. While bummed, I used it as an opportunity to try to get a date... I posted on reddit, and happened to get *three* positive responses.

Friday: Went to hang out with some redditors again (that I met last week). I remembered *every single* name and greeted them as such when I showed up. It helped *tremendously* in how I was received. I met a handful more new people, because I didn't know that at the time and I did a great job of using eye contact, talking about stuff she cared about, and remembering her name. She specifically said goodbye to me as she left for the night, so I felt pretty damn good about it.

Saturday: I went to the annual reddit meetup for my city. I was the *only* person there to focus on people's names. I played it as a party trick a few times

On Saturday I also went to that event with a girl that responded to the post I made on Wednesday. It was *awesome*. I got to hang out with a very pretty girl for about 8 hours. We enjoyed the event, so we'll see! It's this reason that I'm still grinning like an idiot, and this post is probably not written as well as my normal posts.

3. When I get my first paycheck I'm going to start a gym membership. I've been a distance runner for three years but that's ALL I can do.

5. I'm deleting my Facebook in a few days. I'm sending messages to the few people on there that mattered to me and one of them includes my high school crush. I'm going to hopefully get her number and ask her out this summer. That's a goal of mine. I don't see why she would say no as we've been close in years past. I just need time to work up the balls. Just reconnecting with her will do for now.

6. I'm getting a tattoo removed. Long story short, I'm going to own up to my stupid decision and address it as soon as I have the money and transportation.

7. I'm going to look into ways that I can be more social! There's a hobby/tabletop gaming shop that I live by and I'm a shameless otaku/geek. I know a lot of the people there will be just as geeky and awkward as me

The sexually charged conversations one has with women in order to build emotional rapport are obviously very different from those one would have at a cocktail party.

It's always at this point one or two girls I'll have served will stay back to talk with me. Sometimes they'll hint that they want to hang out when I get off, othertimes they'll hand me a napkin or something with their number on it.

1)  I have a pretty specific sort of guy that I'd be interested in.  It's nothing extreme.  I just want someone who is intelligent, I'm *most* willing to negotiate on physical attractiveness, but I will *not* compromise on my religion.  This narrows my pool by quite a lot.

2) I'm majorly an introvert.  I prefer to go out on my own.  I don't usually go out with girlfriends, or people assume there's something wrong with me because I'm alone all the time?  Maybe, I don't know.

3)  I'm shy.  Even at my place of worship I know very few people.  It's a very large one and I'm sure there are lots of great guys just waiting for me to say hi but I'm too shy to do it; mainly because it seems like everyone is in groups and I'm all alone.  It's intimidating.

4)  I do have an online dating account but nothing has ever come of the people that I have met through it

So lets address this shit.

I've been severely messed up a while. I've blamed it on ""depression"". I honestly don't know what the fuck is wrong with me lately. But you need a little backstory to understand.

I'll make a long story short, beat the shit out of my mom, I watched. He got his shit together, for a while. Couple years go by, dad gets hurt on the job, gets addicted to painkillers. While he's out of work for a year, he's dependent on the painkillers. Workers comp quits paying him disability checks to settle the lawsuit, dad fucks some shit up and gets arrested. Then quits painkillers cold turkey and we move in with my grandmother because we're broke. I'm 15 now. My grandmother knows everything, I hop from boyfriend to boyfriend

But lately.. The past 6 months I have been in SUCH a slump. I feel so empty. But at the same time, it's a problem. I get depressed as hell when I don't have a boyfriend, and I'm constantly seeking companionship.. It's very hard for me to let people in. The boyfriends I have, yeah, I tell them all about my life, and the shit that's happened, but I just feel so disconnected from everyone, always happy and pleasant, and truly unhappy. I put on a happy facade when I go to school and am around people, they'll pay attention. I am always criticizing myself. It's hard to see anything I do as good

Do I need medication? Do I need to see a doctor? Or is this something wrong with just the way I'm living? I need guidance. I wanna feel better again, I want to be happy. But my negativity and depressing outlook ruins it all. 

Please don't give me that crap where you tell me, you'll just fix it. I DO WANT TO FIX IT. But this isn't something I know how to fix. I'm so deep in this mindset, it's like I'm buried. I need someone to tell me how to dig myself out. So please, help.

Seriously, and have a life that's easy to talk about. I'm climbing one of my mountains this summer - I quit a really high profile internship to pursue a passion and a dream career in a different field. No money, no guarantees of anything but a hell of a conversation piece that might just turn into a startup or a job when I graduate. As a gamer/programmer/nerd I know how hard it can be initially to relate to people outside of my normal social groups, but if there's one surefire way to make those first connections it's to have something incredible to talk about.

One other note. I'm a rock climber (mostly indoors) and both of the climbing communities I've been a part of have been some of the most welcoming and friendly groups I've encountered. It's really fun, that route is really challenging/fun/etc"". Don't feel like people are criticizing you if they randomly give you pointers while you climb. Every single one of us wants to see you reach the top and will do what we can to help you. If you want to figure something out on your own, just politely say so!

This may sound harsh, and advice from faimprovement- they are great and they are EXTREMELY helpful to me (when I am developing myself to become a better person)  and to probably to the rest of Reddit . However, I see a great flaw  to the system of the advice-help-improvement process. I will go in order to lay out my concern over you Comrades.

1) First off, please DO NOT rely on faimprovement to solve all your social needs. YES, society has its bright and dark sides, YES, you are NOT perfect, and YES you should use faimprovement as your *guide* to success...however, NO, that may sound frightening

2) I cannot emphasize this any further- **The world is evil and unwelcome, if you make it be** Keep thinking that. Keep reflecting on how much you suck, on how lonely you are, and how you have no talent whatsoever. Oh yeah? Keep thinking that, and prove to yourself that by reflecting on what you have done the past season/semester/trimester. Keep thinking on how nobody will like you. HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA LETS GO TO /R/FAIMROVEMENT RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL/WORK/BRUNCH AND FIND A MIRACULOUS CRUTCH. Don't do that to your self. Those kind of thinking(s) will only drive yourself to hell. It's counterproductive. I and many other people have gone that path, and hit a blank wall- Just do not.

3) How will you stop thinking that way you may ask? Well that is where the Third, used by countless Masterminds in hit movies to recruit newbies, I mean truly, you can do what you can achieve. I don't care if no one likes you. I don't give a crud if you are weak, dumb, ugly, beautiful, or asian, and as magnifiscent as you can possibly can. Remember **You are You.** Think about that, is the mind.

Bonus: another note; it is incredibly important. **DO NOT CARE FOR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU**. You DO NOT (I don't hope so) wake up every morning to impress other people. Fuck it. Repeat after me. Fuck it. Take that attitude with you

So Redditors, and unlock your way out into the world. I have said enough. You have gone through enough. Enough is enough. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is time to change the world.

So I started to shake things up. I took a bit better care of myself. Better clothes, but I put a bit more effort into it. And I started forcing myself out of my comfort zone. Small things at first, like eye contact and smiling at strangers.

This took a while

Unfortunately the results so far have been abysmal. The grand total is one number

I'd like a decent social network and a girl.

I don't suffer from the typical FA problems(I love being around people and I'm extroverted) and even after attempts at self improvement I'm still very alone. I've done many things in an attempt to improve myself

I have no anxiety approaching women or talking to people, my height is fine, I'm slim, I'm friendly, I'm well groomed. So I don't know what's missing. I think I'm sort of ugly face wise though(It's the only reason I can think of and often blame it on my face). I go to the gym yet...I am extremely lonely and still a kissless virgin. I have no social network to speak up, 1 friend who doesn't do anything. I just can't get that the ball rolling, I just need one small thing for everything to snowball for me.

I am a great speaker, I dress well, I'm tall, slim, I'm friendly and cultured, I'm well groomed,

 I don't have access to the typical great social life in a university and I suspect this is the reason. I go to a small jr.college with a small amount of women, the loneliness and depression has made my academic progress suffer really badly. Maybe it's just my environment.

I really thought things would work out for me if I just improved myself, improved my abilities with women, and became more open and social and didn't really care about the outcome of things. I've reached a level where women probably think I'm this cool guy but inside I'm still a kissless loser.

Perhaps there's something wrong with me...

Not having my social needs fulfilled has overflowed in other facets in my life and really destroyed my progress in other things.  I'm afraid soon enough I'll be forever single to the point where I'll never have a normal life and be emotionally and physically mature.  I constantly have this huge feeling of frustration

I came across this approach to thinking about rejections last week, and your male ego can't handle it(male ego is very vulnerable), but that's not the case. You see, if you ask a girl out and she says ""no"" then she is REJECTING THE DATE, NOT YOU. If it's a girl you just approached, then she doesn't even know you, so how can she reject YOU as a person when she doesn't know who that person is? No, or grab coffee, maybe it's cold/hot out and she just wants to get home. There can be a million reasons. But there is one thing for sure: it's not you, but you're still awesome!       
And to finish my story: I smiled, no foul"", put on my shoes, wished her good night and went home. I visit this yoga studio regularly, so I know I'll see her again, and I'll be friendly to her again, and it's not awkward at all.

May 3

**How is what you're writing any different from every other technique out there?**

Regarding comparisons to all the other dating techniques out there (from a comment in another post): Yes, but have heard enough about it that I get the gist. I saw one episode of Mystery's VH1 TV show many years ago, and I also accidentally listened to a CD called ""The Art of Seduction"" which was in a used car an ex-boyfriend bought.

I feel like the biggest difference between what I'm writing and the others is that 1) I think it's fucked up to get women by making them feel bad about themselves, get yourself to a place where you can really be fine with it. Improve yourself in ways that will benefit your overall life. I don’t think it’s healthy to NEED someone in your life, but wanting is okay. Do you need a woman like you need food, water and sleep everyday? Why is that? Why can’t you create your own happiness without a significant other? Maybe it’s time to look a little deeper in yourself.

Examples of what I don’t like from the other guys: The negging technique. The first definition from Urban Dictionary: ""Low-grade insults meant to undermine the self-confidence of a woman so she might be more vulnerable to your advances."" No thanks. Then on Mystery's show, then go sit and talk to her friend while basically ignoring the one you really like. She's supposed to feel crap that you're ignoring her and start to want you in order to make herself feel more adequate. What the fuck? Finally, there’s the CD I listened to. I think that was the worst one of all. The guy was basically saying that in order to get and keep a woman's attention, keep eating away at her self-esteem, drop in little compliments now and then, but keep her feeling bad about herself so she needs your validation constantly. What. The. Fuck. If a guy tried any of those things on me, I'd be like ""Are you serious? Go fuck yourself.""

I talked to a friend about these posts yesterday, no matter how you word it. Girls will know what you're trying to do and will see right through you. I disagreed. The stuff I'm typing would (and has) worked on me, even if no one else, because I feel that it is coming from a genuine place. The guy is not trying to 1) chisel away at my self-esteem, and 2) there is less awkwardness because I am the one who will approach him if I’m interested in more (as opposed to him showering me with attention and me giving strong hints that I’m not interested). Even if I THINK he's saying/doing stuff to try to get in my pants, he is still not trying to make me feel bad about myself and he’s not harassing me, so why should it bother me? It wouldn't. I have a few friends who are guys that I could tell were interested in me, sorry

So that's it. The end.

The biggest thing I've been working on this week out of that book is using people's first names.

I'm generally horrible at remembering names, I've been really focusing on it. I've started with just the grocery store as practice. Every time I go, I memorize the name of everyone that helps me, and make sure to call them by their name at least twice during the short time I'm there. I then come home, write the name down and doodle something related to their job, and stare at it for a minute or two, and then tear it up.

So far it's actually worked quite well, and I can remember all their names and faces. Every time I go from now on I'm going to make sure I use their name in such a way that shows I remember it and I'm not just looking at their name tag.

I'm excited to try this out in a group of people. I think remembering their names after hearing it once will help me out a great deal in making friends.

Created this account today to deal with my loneliness (my one other account isn't anonymous). After having a pity party for a few hours (something I seem to end up doing once month)


**About Me:**
I'm a 25 yo male in an uncommon situation. I grew up in a very conservative Christian home and really only had friends at church

My entire life I've been kind of person who desires a few close friends. I prefer small-group scenarios and detest situations where I can't hear myself think (most bars

I messed up in college and had to move back home and switch schools. At the same time, just because my Christian friends and I had next to nothing in common anymore (despite cordial exchanges), and my college friends lived too far away. I ended up with a few acquaintances, but no mutual friendships (I would support them or go to their gatherings, but they would never reciprocate).

I graduated college, having lived by myself for 2 years, working from home, making $80k a year. I unintentionally gained 80 pounds in the past two years, due to my sedentary job and ordering way too much pizza and Chinese. I have a small handful of acquaintances, but still they're one-way friendships, and they *all* have significant others and other best friends. It happens often that they go hang out and I'm not invited. The girls all thought I was gay for an entire year because my apartment is too clean, and I'm a ""nice guy"".

**Why does that matter?**

1) I work from home

2) I make significantly more than any of my acquaintances

3) My personality is such that all the typical places outside of work to make friends and meet girls are places that I can't stand for more than 10 minutes. Additionally

4) A lot of my self-worth is derived from having close friends who ""are there for me"". Not in a needy way

5) I live by myself

**The Good**

1) In the past year I've gotten to do some awesome stuff.
       - I saw 15 Broadway Shows in 18 days in NY.... alone.
       - I went to Germany
       - I went to Chicago, and Toledo.... alone.
       - I've seen Seinfeld, and Green Day.... alone.
       - Universal and Disney World... alone.

Note: I invited specific people, *offering to pay if someone couldn't afford it*, and still ended up going alone.


-----------------------------

**The Change**

In the past I've tried to motivate myself to lose weight. I've succeeded in dropping 10 pounds once

I'm going to follow the steps outlined by [shakedown_st](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/o4mx5/start_here/)

**Long Term Goals**

1) Have close-friends that I can count on and hang out with several times a week.

2) Have a SO or at least go on a number of dates. Figure out where to meet the kind of girls I like.

3) Weigh roughly 180lbs with a toned body shape (currently 255lbs with a ""beer gut""

4) Without changing *who I am*

5) ... ? What I don't know. I imagine there will be things along this journey that I realize I want that I don't even recognize right now.


**First Week Goals**

1) Wake up and go biking every morning.

2) Cook every single meal

3) Listen to [Book 1](http://www.audible.com/pd?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B002V8MHJ6) while biking.

4) Update with progress next Saturday.

5) Update w/ comments on my own posts each day

**CLARIFICATION**

I haven't followed all of Shakedown's journey, but I doubt it. I want to be able to approach people and make friends, and go on dates and meet the right girl, but I'm not looking for one-night-stands.

I did this because I'd never done it

An interesting side effect of this is that I discovered that while I have an average sized cock, but twice. In what must have been a half hour interval at best. I decided to carry one with me at all times because, well, you never know.

The next important step after that was to do a cold approach. I had tried getting myself to do this years ago and always managed to psych myself out of it. I had to buy some pants anyway

I was having a hard time psyching myself up to do it

*Her: ""Hi""
*Me: ""Hi there"" (scottish accent failed
*Me: ""Can I ask your opinion on something?""
*Her: ""Sure""
*Me: ""What do you think of this outfit?""

She actually walks out from behind the register to get a good look

* Her: ""I... I don't know"" She's still smiling at least

She's off script

I decide to go with one of my canned answers anyway

* Me: ""Thats exactly what I was going for: total confusion!""

She laughs a little bit

She tells me the total and I hand over my debit card

* Her: ""Did you hear about the sales?""
* Me: ""Oh yes

She laughs a little

I get a ""bright"" idea

* Me: ""Have you tried accents?""
* Her: ""No""
* Me: ""I think you should
* Her: ""No. Maybe I'll have someone else do it""
* Me: ""No

I slip ""smoothly"" into scottish accent

* ScottishMe: ""Just go ahead and put on a scottish accent. It doesn't even matter if it's any good.""

* Her: ""Clever""

It's not that I don't want to socialize at all; in fact, but it's a kind of escapist in-my-head positivity that is destroyed by trying to socialize.

If I'm feeling better, ignoring doesn't happen automatically, and I don't really want to do it deliberately. I want to socialize and I feel like I should, but I still don't know what to do and I'm stuck on that. My emotions in a social context still aren't very positive, for example, not allowing me to truly say hi in a positive way. This triggers an anxiety that is more painful than the automatic avoidance tension. It can also lead to a more problematic kind of avoidance, where I avoid being around people instead of just avoiding connection.

If I'm feeling even better, I could work on improving social skills, getting to know people and making friends.

I also surprised myself because I worked on my paper last night without procrastinating and having a really good focus. I didn't get tempted with the treasures of my addiction; fapping being one of them and I managed to control my time. I need more of this

I feel free, I fret and I don't know what to do. I can ever go far as to say I do not fully act with coherent thoughts, my mind's been stressed so much that I guess it's looking for something to stress about. I find myself going back and forth; misplacing things and being gullible.

I do not like being gullible because I know becoming too cheeky will trip me up.

For example: ""Ohh wow I've done my work! I feel great! Of course I should! But look at me I'm not rushing anymore!"".
I know this sort of attitude will, I would do something stupid, break something, mess something up or hurt myself. It becomes worst because it's combined with my incoherent thoughts.

I guess I'm not used to having no feelings of not being rushed. I want to though, I have to keep myself up everyday to be productive, it still feels uncomfortable. Some would probably say that slowing down is healthy and pausing/meditating, having no thoughts but I'm afraid that I'll lose track of time and end up at my comfortable environment: the rushing, stressed, cram induced lifestyle.

1. **Emotions will likely be the hardest part.** -- Internalizing self-worth and getting yourself on a stable emotional footing is likely to be the hardest part. It may be easy (as it was for me) *until* you start dating. Then the true rejection -- after a few dates -- will hurt like hell.
2. **Having another guy to talk to is VITAL to improvement.** -- This subreddit is *NOT* enough to support you when you're depressed or facing rejection. You absolutely 100% must find another person to talk to as soon as you start trying to improve yourself.
3. **Always discuss with your support person.** -- If I'd talked to my friend before sending that email
4. **Don't reply to a rejection while you're hurt.** -- Get your mind off it



**Personal Thoughts You Can Skip:**

The date yesterday was great -- we connected (so I thought) on every level. The chemistry was amazing, and going out in public. She fed every desire/need I've had for the past... who knows how many lonely miserable years. She showed me that sex with someone you're attracted to is *amazing*. I mean... holy crap.

Then today comes around, but also sees some arrogance and coldness in me that didn't used to be there.

(Side note... WHAT?! Me

She also said that while there were parts of yesterday that still make her smile, etc.?). So I was crushed. I read the email twice, and it felt like I'd messed everything up somehow. It was my fault once again, I was a loser who couldn't get anything right. I was arrogant and cold, and was a jerk who caused girls pain.

I snapped, but I'm terrified now that I pushed her away. And since I've received no response email, I'm still terrified of that.

I was just about to write that she said she just needed time to digest everything and that we'd probably get together after my trip out of town

&gt; I think I need longer than a day to process everything.  So it might be wise to postpone our previously planned Monday rendezvous.

The idea is that we’d be paired with up to six mentors from /r/datingadvice, helped to change both the belief system and set of corresponding actions that I believe keeps us alone.

This is a group mentoring project because I think groups are invaluable when trying to overcome challenges like this. Groups have deeper wisdom and often come up with better decisions than an individual would alone. Groups can also be much more motivating; not least because if you promise a group you’re going to do something it’s much more likely you’ll do it.

Once we’ve described ourselves and what we’re looking for we’ll be paired with our mentors. They’ll want to know more about us

Once the background work has been done, measurable steps to take towards our goal. The deadline helps us focus. The challenging but achievable steps develops our sense of self-determination. The measurable nature helps us understand we’re making progress. 

This is an action-orientated project, in order we understand that what went wrong is not due to something permanent and unchangeable about us or our luck. This will be an ongoing process because it’s likely we’ll encounter bumps along the way and we’ll need to be careful not to be catastrophic about them too.

We’ll need to be honest

It goes into the psychology of each gender and explains why men do certain things and why women do certain things (such as why women love shopping and men don't). It provides great advice in how to handle various situations (when someone uses emotional blackmail).

The greatest piece of advice I took away from the book is the differences between the way men and women communicate. When men talk, when a woman wants to talk about her problems, she actually doesn't want solutions. She just wants to talk and for you to listen and be empathetic. As males, we find this odd. Why talk about your problems if you aren't going to seek advice on how to solve them? Women talk to relieve their stress and feel better.

I don’t know how to constructively react to this. The way I reacted before, contributed a lot toward making me FA and made me hate people. 

Pointing out the problem and asking nicely doesn’t help much. It would at best cause a temporary improvement followed by a resumption of the old pattern. Getting upset about it is not any more helpful, but I don’t like such a submissive surrendering response. Perhaps the most satisfying response is to ignore and disrespect them in return, and be less willing to help when they ask for help. This is however not constructive.

I am a 23 old guy who seems to be a forever alone type of dude like many around. I graduated college recently and moved back home to pretty much start working. I have a rather good job for out of college

Also I want to note although I have had several Friends that were girls

Now as to why I am here posting today.
 
In college I had always a rather tight-knit group of friend I hung around with. I was more than likely less social outside of that group

Now that I have moved away from my friends Fort Myers, so I have begun to be at a bit of a loss/struggle here.

Let me tell you where I am at. I work with majority of older people, so I have been attempting to just go out to a bar/restaurant to some degree of self-help. 

I must also note that I have also been able to utilize some free time

Realizing something needed to change in my personality thought process, and literally have been reading the shakedown method rather intensely since then. It seems to be the guide, per se, that might lead to the change I need to not only find that girl, but also become a more social/confident person in general. I am confident I am that nice guy, but socially I have a lot to work on. 

Was coming here and giving a serious try to this method a good thing? I actually haven’t checked to see about any success stories yet

I am currently 70% ready to give this method a shot starting tomorrow

In just 25 days, *I've improved those friendships to be a bit closer to equal give-and-take.* I did this by being vocal about when I want to hang out and what I want to do, as well as using the tips in How to Win Friends to make myself more engaging and fun to be around.

* Never approach a girl from behind.
* Lean backwards or face slightly away.
* Don't sit on the opposite side of the table from the girl you like
* Wear one thing that makes you easily approachable.

I used all of these tips on my date tonight, getting her arm looped through mine, and eventually the kiss goodnight.

I highly recommend the [Audible.com Audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002V8MHJ6&amp;qid=1335393790&amp;sr=1-1). However

**Personal Reflection:** For me personally, because I had to learn to be happy with myself, by myself. However, I still participate in self-destructive behavior, don't have a good view of masculinity, and let fear run much of my life (social situations, etc.). I think I've swung too far towards being selfish

**The Bad / Things I Disagree With:** 
Seems to me that the book is outdated. It's written in 2003, though some may be ashamed of that fact and hide it. I'm going to do my best to give it up, but I may partake every once in a while after a ""moratorium"" time period, because I don't find it to be as detrimental as he claims, when taken in moderation.

The book is also heavily geared towards men in marriages

**Putting it into practice...**

In hindsight, taking care of myself), but all those were things that I already knew I needed to do, and I haven't done simply because of a lack of willpower. So now I just need to have a system for increasing my willpower. Here are some things I'm going to do in order to actually put this into practice.

* **[""Don't Break the Chain""](http://www.reddit.com/r/faimprovement/comments/srab4/dont_break_the_chain/)** -- used for exercising
* **[Have a Bucket List](http://i.imgur.com/t7HuR.jpg)** - Make a spreadsheet or list of things you want to do in your life. Then strive to achieve one or two items every year
* **Face your fears.** -- Don't be afraid to work out in front of people, face less practical fears -- go skydiving if you're afraid of heights, or go give a talk somewhere if you're afraid of public speaking.
* **Finish Your Projects.** -- Don't start a new project until you finish an old one. *Period*. Commit to what you start and see it through. If you aren't sure if it's something you want to do or not
* **Take Care of Yourself.** - This is largely Step #0, dressing properly, financial responsibility, and yet still *having fun*.
* **Ask for Help.** - If you need to see a psychologist/psychiatrist


**Conclusion:**

* **Self Confidence is king

* **Stop trying to fill girls' needs or fix their problems.**

* **You're more attractive when you look out for yourself first.**

I am here for that reason.


**stop giving any fucks at all**


You care too much, to me, that by labeling yourself forever alone you have already embraced failure. The problem is that you have embraced it in a negative way, wallowing in it instead of learning from it. The worst you can do is fail. If you ask a girl and she says no, move on it isn't a big deal. If someone shits on you then snipe back because they deserve it, be funny with it as laughs gain friends and interest in you. At worst be caustic because they deserve it. If she ignores your advances then go straight over to her friend because that demonstrates the amount of fucks you give, which should be zero at any given time.


**Be an asshole**


Some women love this. If somebody shits on you let it bounce off because let's face it they are idiots and though you may not believe it you are better than they are. If a women turns you down then say, diminish their perceived value to yourself. They have to earn your respect, then they gain value. 


**Be direct


Make your intentions clear, dress, nails, eyes and then continue with your conversation. I guess what I mean here is to convey that you find them attractive through compliments and listening to them. Which brings me to my next point.


**Drop your bullshit at the door**


I don't give a rats ass if you don't do small talk

**Have a drink**


If you don't drink then start. There is a point where you are not drunk but you are drunk enough to have confidence. I suggest two or three strong drinks maximum. Do not get wasted, for both of you, think Raj from the big bang theory. And remember not to get hammered because those who get hammered don't get to nail.


**Networking**


I don't care how much you hate small talk or detest the bastards you are surrounded by


**Recreate yourself. Lie


Create a persona, cars or other common interests. Develop a silver tongue. Learn to bullshit your way through anything. Get comfortable with being the center of attention even for a short time. A lot can be learned from psychopaths and highly functioning sociopaths. The joke here is that you think I'm fucking with you.


**Be a man**


If you have feelings keep them under wraps. Appear conserved and confident even if you aren't. Western culture is rapidly being feminized, skinny jeans and painted nails type. This isn't 100% true but it is true of the good ones. I'm talking about the mature and mentally stable ones. If you need a reference for classic manliness think Clint Eastwood. Act reserved, strong, speak with clarity and intent. 


**Get off the Internet
I mean it


**Dress appropriately**


For most of you this will mean jeans (try Levi 501's) a shirt (nothing over the top) some trainers (adidas do some that go great with jeans eg. Sambas) In some cases a t-shirt or something similar can work well with jeans and trainers can be interchanged with boots or shoes. Whatever you do dress appropriate. Never over or under dress.


**Don't be afraid to order**


Whether alone or with company don't be afraid to order


**How you carry yourself**

This is all about appearing confident, assertive and having a prescence in a room. You can't get away with a stunt like the one above without knowing how to carry yourself. Be firm with your words but calm, look people in the eye when talking. Have a stern expression when dealing with service industry staff so they know that they are going to serve you whether they want to or not.


**Be in control**


Be it a conversation or an a date make sure you control the situation, when you are thinking of asking a girl on a date do not ask where she wants to go or if she wants to go to X. You say that you are going to X and ask her if she wants to come with. It adds some ""I don't give a fuck"" factor and she will be more likely to oblige. The last thing is that you shouldn't contact her too often, especially during dating. A 3 times a week max. One is a how are you and two are asking if she wants to accompany you to X on Xday at Xpm.


**Emotions**


Never spill your emotions to a girl from the offset


**Research**


Treat potential dates as targets, music and such but nothing too personal.


**fake it till you make it**


Even if these things are natural if you fake them for long enough they will become second nature and you will have changed yourself. However do not lose that spark

All are welcome and you can work on any aspect of relationships you want. Here's my pitch why you should do it.

It might not be possible say that relationships are the most important thing in life but life's definitely better when they're good. Good relationships support us, that we're alright - even better - on our own. But it's not true.

Without good relationships life is harder and poorer. As the Swedish proverb goes ""Shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow half a sorrow"". When our relationships aren't working we struggle more

It takes effort to make a relationship good. We don't have to change to make someone love us

They're called relationship skills, experience and most of all, practice. This project is intended to help you practice the skills you want to learn, whilst benefiting from the knowledge and experience of others who are either going through the process or mentoring you along the way.

Thirty minutes practice a day might not sound like a lot, console or help solve the problems you face?

Ours is a dating subreddit but the problems we encounter in romantic relationships are most probably played out in other areas too. So if you want to work on loving relationships, be that work, friends or family.

Don't have a goal in mind? Don't worry the group can help with that. All you need is the desire to find the time and the willingness to do the work. There can be no promises about what result you'll get but it's very likely something will happen and besides,False,,t5_2tav6,False,,,t3_sy44v

The idea is that for the month of May we spend 30 minutes each day working on an aspect of our relationships. It might be that you want to start a relationship or to become better at the one you're already in. The goal you choose is entirely up to you. All you need do is commit to working on it for 30 minutes a day

You might think that there's not much you can achieve with only 30 minutes effort but I assure you, but if you feel particularly stuck the proof that change is happening can be just the kick you need to get you going. There's also something very empowering about making a commitment to yourself and to others. And then delivering on it.
