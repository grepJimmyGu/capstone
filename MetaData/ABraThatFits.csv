This CH Biszkopty arrived yesterday, and now I just want to show it off. I've compared it to the last bra I bought before I started figuring this all out. It's a 34A, which believe it or not, I thought looked really good.

I've been wearing a 34A bra since I started buying bras, of course, but it never occurred to me that they could. My boobs were just too tiny. My breasts would fully come out the bottom of my bra as soon as I so much as stood up straight. I just slouched and constantly pulled it down. My straps were constantly falling off my shoulders, and even unhooking themselves and falling down my sleeves. To avoid the embarrassment of bra straps, I would wear strapless bras and hike them up super high, constantly adjusting and slouching so they wouldn't fall down. I cannot believe I accepted this, but I did. For over 10 years. I'm 24. Because without a bra, and that felt even worse. 

A bra that fits has made me love my boobs. Sure they're small

I had read and read every resource from this subreddit and taken all the advice that everyone had given in that previous thread, she'll forever more have this story to tell about how her batshit insane husband tried to tell her about bras.  That pushed it over the edge as she would love to have something like that over me. =p

So I break it all down. I explain the basics as seen on this subreddit.  I explain again how ""an A cup is an A cup"" is not true at all.  I show her [the links](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2012/05/bra-school-not-all-d-cups-are-same-size.html) to back it up.  She's starts to get shocked.  She's starts to make comments about how that's now how she always believed it to be!  I go on and on covering everything about [sister sizes](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2013/04/what-sister-size-bras-look-like.html) and I also she her the [great diagram](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/i39z-7cv35uEv6Ph.png) about the ratios that really changed everything.  She's starting to get intrigued

Finally, but she doesn't think she does.  But I'm ready for that, so I explicitly show her [this blog post](http://brasandbodyimage.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/) pointing out the ABTF additions at the bottom of girls with ""small boobs"".  She's still not convinced, but intrigued.

She says

Fortunately

By this point

Cut to this morning.  She's got an early hair appointment so she's already up and dressed when I wake up.  Turns out she's done some experimenting of her own!  She has on the aforementioned 38B and she said she was really aggressively scooping and swooping (later last night I finally showed her [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=it29EzYo24w) so she'd know how aggressive to be).  She said she did it only on one side and looked down and was blown away.  It was a huge difference!   She had done it really aggressively scooping and said she could really feel tissue being pulled up and into the cup.   To be honest her chest looked magnificent...even moreso than usual. =)  She's a total believer now.  She even said that I've totally blown her mind and she couldn't believe how she had it all wrong and she's going to send messages to all the women she knows about this stuff.  LOL...SUCCESS!    So after her hair appointment, that's equivalent of like a 34DD, and I bet she never thought she'd be like a double D. =p  She smiled and agreed...and just kinda looked happy and excited about it all.  She said again how this may change her life.  I'm so happy because I'll think she'll be so much more confident about her appearance this way.

Many thanks to everyone here in ABTF for all the help you gave me [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1jgixc/trying_to_convince_my_wifeneed_help/).  This is a truly great and helpful community and I really appreciate everyone's help especially considering I'm just a guy. =)  I'll post more updates if there's more interesting news and maybe even convince her to post some before and after photos so you all can see the difference and help evaluate the final fit!   Thanks again everyone!

EDIT: Update!  So she did try on a variety of them at Target and Nordstrom today.   It seems like 38C is where it's at.   Even 36D wasn't working for her as the band was too tight.   The 38C are maybe just SLIGHTLY too small in the cups, so it seems like that is right.    

So then we went online and ordered her a variety...we got some of the recommended ones from the shallow breast guide and some that she liked the look.  Trying to recall, 1 Wacoal, 2 b.tempt'd, and 1 Pour Moi?...so that seems like a nice sampling of the brands.  We got all 38C except for one 40B to try.   Hopefully as they come in, we can get some pics of the ones she likes and ABTF can help us assess the fit and give suggestions.  Thanks again everyone!",,False,t5_2s8kf,True

Yes, many of their fitters are inept (I’d also argue that most fitters any place are as well). And I do understand that they have been a horrible experience for many. However, some women do actually fall within that size range and seeing poisonous view towards their go-to bra store cannot feel good to them. This subreddit should be a safe place for everyone.

Furthermore, involving them in the community. What we should not do is continue to drive them off.

Frankly, aren't we?

It's said that nearly 90% of women are wearing the wrong bra size, and I know this to be true because for years, I was one of them. It was only after doing intense research online, fitting myself using several different methods, and trying on dozens of bras that I learned what a difference a properly fitting bra can make! Now that I understand how the fit of the bra is impacted by the size and shape of the breast and the brand and type of bra, I am committed to helping other women find comfortable, a store that is often praised for its excellent bra selection and professionalism in fitting.

1360075351.0,17xmbj,Ode to ABraThatFits,RevDupas,178,18,26,"For years I wore a 30A

My self-esteem was dry

I wore a crop-top every day

And never questioned why. 



Though I longed for frills and lace

I knew they weren't for me

My little breasts would be out of place

In such bras of luxury. 



But peer pressure finally got to me

My embarassment

Passing the A's

Lack of knowledge was my curse. 



Many years of shame soon passed

And I was introduced to Reddit

ABraThatFits

But alas



'80 percent don't wear their best

But that did not apply to me!

A B barely fit my tiny chest!

Wasn't that plain to see? 



One day MyWifesBusty's measuring guide

I decided to try for a giggle

My boyfriend measured around my side

While I tried not to wiggle. 



As so many of us have

'That simply cannot be!

No

I can't be a 30E!'. 



Only pornstars have that size

Mine were a handful at best

I dismissed my results as complete lies

And ashamedly covered my breast. 



But curiosity niggled at me

'til I gave in and trudged into town

The assistant said '32C'

Then left me alone with a frown. 



Disheartened yet not defeated

Your testimonials gave me heart

I refused to be easily cheated

Giving up would not be smart. 



Ignoring the sizing suggestion

I took a 30E into the stall

Suddenly

Reeling



Comparable only to orgasm

With nirvana

I had my first real bra-gasm

As I stared at my gorgeous reflection. 



Now it's because of your teaching

That wearing clothes seems a shame

That my friends are sick of my preaching

And my love for bras



So non-believers

Popular opinions are very wrong

Don't put so much faith in the cup

It's been about the band:cup ratio all along. 



Finally

Now I am so proud of my tits

Thanks to all you boys and birds

You angels of ABraThatFits.

They offered to measure me, I've never been measured here. The associate first measured around my armpits, across the top of my chest. (This is an incredibly dumb measurement. You'll notice that most women do not, in fact, wear their bras across the top of the chest.) Then she measured my full bust. I could see her counting under her breath, and she looked alarmed when she clearly went past VS's available sizes. Still, she proclaimed me ""a 36DDD"" and handed me one to try on.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA no. My actual size is 32HH. That's two band sizes too big and four cup volumes too small. (The volume of 36DDD = 34FF = 32G.) I tried the bra for the sake of the experiment, and the center front stood out a good three inches.

To her credit, I already looked pretty skeptical and the fit was REALLY bad, so I think she knew it was a lost cause. I said gently, ""Usually when I measure, I measure at the underbust. I normally wear 32HH."" ""I bet that fits a lot better."" ""Yeah, it does."" She then asked if I worked in the industry, and I said no, that makes sense!"" she replied.

Afterwards, the largest cup size they had. European sizing is different from the UK system, and the saleslady, even after five years at this store, could not explain to me how the sizing worked, so I'm not sure what the UK equivalent to an I cup is. Of course it was much too small, and she suggested I go up a band size. I pointed out that the reason the band looked too small was because the cup was far too small, clearly not believing me that a too-small cup can make a correctly sized band appear too small.

&gt; Hello. I see that your newest ad campaign talks about the Body by Victoria line and says ""A Body for Every Body"". However

&gt; My measurements are 25 inches for the underbust and 30 inches for the bust. This puts me at a size 26D. In store, but the associates try to sell me the bra anyway, either because they're trying to make a sale, or because they simply don't know how a bra should fit. It is sad that a company that is supposed to advocate correctly fitting bras trains their associates so poorly, and even teaches incorrect fitting techniques on their website. Is Victoria's Secret planning on correcting these problems?

&gt; As of right now, they would find that it is absolutely necessary to stock bras in sizes 28-50 A-J. The cost of stocking these sizes would surely be offset by the multitude of women who would actually be able to purchase bras in their size at a Victoria's Secret.

&gt; The demand for sub-30 bands in the United States is huge. Those of us in this category (and there are many of us) have to resort to purchasing bras from Europe. Wouldn't it make good business sense to be the first American brand to sell bras in sizes 26-30 A-J?
Also on that note: Why is it that the only 30 bands available to purchase from VS are only available in A and B cup sizes? And why are they only in a few select PINK styles?

&gt; I will be waiting eagerly for a response.

It looked seriously miserable, I started ranting about it to him, and got a skeptical look when I said breast tissue can migrate to the back.

So I pulled up the Venusian Glow post (which is [here](http://www.venusianglow.com/2011/12/proof-that-breast-tissue-can-migrate-to.html), I convinced him, and let the issue drop.

I texted him back

He is sincerely disturbed by this - I have a hard time not dying of laughter every time he brings it up. I've explained again and again that there is no reason for tissue to have migrated since he hasn't been wearing bras

Like most little girls, my nipples stuck out a little more, but I never developed anything that even remotely looked like breasts.  I guess the boob fairy missed my house.  
  
  
Like many women with small breasts (or just breasts, shame, and ridicule because of my size.  School was a nightmare, and even as an adult I am frequently made to feel inferior because I don't look the way a ""normal"" woman should.  Women tell me that my clothes would look better if I had breasts to fill them out, or refer to my breasts as manly or childish.  Men joke about my ""tiny titties"" while simultaneously assuring me (unbidden!) that ""some men are into that"".  My female relatives love to comment on how my breasts ""just don't look right"" in dresses when compared to theirs.  And don't even get me started on the time a busty coworker and I accidentally wore the same blouse to a meeting at our male-dominated company.  
  
  
To make a long story short, but I'll let you all in on a little secret: It hurts.  A lot.  
  
  
So when I came to ABTF and quickly had the ""unicorn"" label slapped across my chest, and the ""unicorn"" label reflects that rarity.  I get it.  But at the same time, I am yet again being singled out in a place that I should find welcoming.  Once again I am being made to feel as if I am abnormal or wrong because of my size.  I am not a woman.  I am not even a human. I am a mythical creature.  I am a unicorn.    
  
  
For those that don't know, but that's where the fun stops.  We constantly take flak from other women, both here at ABTF and in other female-oriented subs, because everyone believes that we cannot possibly be this bra size.  I get it that the majority of women are wearing the wrong size bra and yada, yada, yada, but it gets old REAL fast.  I cannot post anything bra- or breast-related without three or four women jumping down my throat about wearing the wrong bra size.  Even when I assure them that this is in fact my measured size, treating me as if I'm too stupid to know my own size.  I've hated my breasts since I was twelve years old and all this - on top of the already depressing ""unicorn"" label - definitely does not help.  
  
  
I don't really know what my intention is here.  Maybe I would have done better to post this on r/offmychest.  I don't have a better label in mind for those that fit into conventional bra sizes - though it would be nice if we could just avoid labeling each other altogether.

I have a little bit of escaped breast tissue/armpit fat, but because of my small bust and long torso, it's just going to happen. Going up to a 28FF or 30F would clearly be way too much cup for me.

So why doesn't it work? In my case it's both of the reasons I mentioned

**A Muscular Back**

If you lift weights, it will be actual breast tissue taking up most of that measurement. But if you are an athlete or lift weights 3+ times a week, you may want to take this into account and try bras with a 'flatter' shape or in a smaller cup size than you measure. You can measure the back half of your back at both the underbust line and the nipple line to see how much of a difference is taken up by your back, rather than your breast tissue.


**Conical Breasts**

The other issue here is conical breasts. A lot of us have seen the ['orange in a glass' post](http://www.venusianglow.com/2012/09/small-breasts-with-broad-base.html) that comes with shallow breasts. Conical breasts are the opposite - they are usually small, they look more like &gt; from the side (again -- conical breasts are usually *small*!). Holding the tape measure snugly to give your hanging breast more of a ) shape can help make this measurement more accurate.

_______________________________________________________________________


So what does this mean? It still means that **everyone** should measure according to MWB's guide. I look like an 'A cup'

(First Thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1alu9k/giving_a_bra_fitting_talk_today/)

First off thank you SO much for all your help before!  I got asked to do this last min. so I appreciate all the help!


This talk went PHENOMENAL!  I've been asked by sisters to give the talk 3 additional times and I am now the token bra girl in our chapter.  I have measured many sisters and they are always shocked at what I tell them they are.  I told one girl she was a 34G  (she was wearing a 38C)and her eyes got wide and she just said ""you're lying!  No way!"" I just told all of them to go to Nordstrom rack and just try it.  A number of them did!  The 34G girl came running up to me the next time she saw me shouting about how she never knew a bra fit so well and how her back has stopped hurting!  At chapter she nominated me for ""sister of the week"" and even showed the whole chapter her new bra!  Since then I get asked to do fittings all the time!  

People are always shocked but after I explain how bra's should fit, they seem to get it and are much more open to trying it.  Once they try it they never go back!   

So thank you SO much ladies!  It really helped and I love fitting my sisters and seeing their boobies supported!",,t5_2s8kf,1365606124.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1c2ce5/update_giving_a_bra_fitting_talk_today/

Do you think you have shallow breasts?  Do you have no clue at all?  Do you not even know what shallow breasts look like? Do you have no idea what kind of bras to buy for shallow breasts?  Well

**What are shallow breasts with a wide root?**

Simply put, a person with shallow breasts has breast tissue that starts all the way up near the collarbone.

**Okay

[Here's a diagram of some different shallow breasts vs. someone with more projection](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnIpeGDU2WE/UEYGVHZOCgI/AAAAAAAAA20/AkCVXUtLzcE/s1600/shallow+breasts.jpg) (mostly SFW).  You'll notice that the slope of the breast starts up much higher than the far right breasts.  In addition

**Right

Luckily, but there doesn't seem to be much projection going on.

**What are some other possible indicators of shallow breasts with wide roots?**

* Many bras, but you never seem to be able to fill out the cup itself.
* The bra size you come up with using [The Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) seems to be giving you a size that is much too large from what you look like.  Note: this is different than the sticker shock of learning your new size (for example
* Professional fitters often get your band size correct
* Shallow shapes are extremely common in cupsizes A-E and bandsizes 28-32.  However
* Unlined bras rarely work for you
* You are trans*\.
* You would describe your breasts as more teardrop-shaped than round/spherical.

**What are some things to look for when choosing a bra?**

Finding bras that work for ladies with shallow breasts and wide roots is a challenge.  Most bras have too much projection

* The cups have only vertical seams
* The top edge of the cups is as close to horizontal as possible.  [Good](http://i.imgur.com/wM96Dar.jpg) vs. [bad](http://i.imgur.com/GScMlM5.jpg).
* The top edge is open (vertical)

Please note: these are just suggestions.  Many bras that follow these guidelines won't work for shallow breasts

Also note: many bras labeled as *balconette* follow the three guidelines above

For more detailed information regarding brands, please check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1eeifc/detailed_results_from_the_survey_of_bras_and/).

**Are these bras sold in brick and mortar stores?**

If you weren't already aware, and Dillards.  Nordstrom sells 30+ bands and cups A-J (UK).  However, a majority of the bras they sell do not work well for shallow breasts.  If you are smaller than a 30E (UK), you only have Betsey Johnson demis to try on.  If your cup size is an E or larger, then you only have Freya's padded half cups available to try on.  If you wear a 32E or a 34E (UK), you have both lines to try on.  Beyond those, most of the bras they sell will probably not work for shallow breasts.  Note: this information is from Nordstrom's website

**Is there any way that bras that don't generally work for shallow/wide breasts can be made into shallower- and wider-cupped bras?**

This idea is in its infancy, then altering them down to the correct band size.  Along these lines, if you find that a bra is just on the cusp of being too narrow and/or too deep, consider going up a sister size.  Caveat: this will work much less often for shorter people, as the straps will be set too wide in the back, and will be much more prone to falling down.  Here is [the blog post that kick-started this idea](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2013/04/what-sister-size-bras-look-like.html).  As more people experiment and document this theory, I hope to update this section with more information and links.

**Here are two Google Docs Spreadsheets in which you can view the data analysis I have done:**

I spent years in a 36 band, because that was what made sense. If I weight 60 lbs more than my friend in the 32, then surely I must be at least 4 inches bigger than her, right?

**Please don’t be afraid to ask for help!** This is merely an effort to make it clear what things are helpful to include in such a request. If all you know are your measurements and that you have been wearing a 36DD from Victoria's Secrets

**1)** It is recommended that you put the brand(s) and the size(s) into the **title of your post**. For example

**2) Give your measurements

Nice additional info would be height, post breast-reduction, pigeon breast, funnel chest, being X weeks pregnant, being a nursing mom with child X weeks/months of age, breast cancer, short anything that might be relevant. 

**3) Make a list of all the bras** you have tried. Start with **brand, where it is comfortable and where it isn't. 

Are the wires too wide or too narrow, gore width? Do you get quadboob, are the straps rubbing you, ...? Do you must have this bra no matter how bad the fit bc the neckline is the only one that is low enough to go under your prom dress? 

**Please make your descriptions as detailed as possible. If you are not comfortable with posting photos

If you can

If you try the bras at a store, model and size and then take pictures of yourself in the bra. You don't have to show the pictures to anybody, but it helps you to remember the bras later. 

**4)** Bratabase is an ideal tool to keep track of what you have tried. If you diligently entered all your bras from your order(s) into bratabase

**5)** Photos are the easiest

**6)** If you include pictures

Position the lense at bra height. Put your hands on your hips. Take the following shots:

- Right profile
- 45 degree angle shot from the right side
- frontal view
- 45 degree angle shot from the left side
- profile view from the left side
- backview/ band length
- close-ups of certain problem areas.

At the very least do profile on the larger side

Make sure the wires are visible in profile view or 45 degree angle view. Do not lift your arms above shoulder height for profile view

My thought is that it would simply be a yes/no answer to whether the bra works well for various cup-size ranges, etc.  So I'm wondering:

* Does a database/spreadsheet like the one I linked make sense to you?
* Does a dichotomous yes/no make sense? Would a ""fit scale"" (e.g.
* Should the cup size ranges, etc. differ from what I've laid out? (E.g., does it make sense to have cup size ranges in 3 categories of A-D, DD-G, GG+?)
* Are there other characteristics that you'd like to be included in this type of database?

Also, if a bra fits shallow breasts could be borrowed from /u/ankylosaurus_rex's shallow breast guide if she's amenable to this, but what about the other categories?

On that same note, USE A THROWAWAY. We cannot stop them from sending you PMs. Some women do not mind the creepy PMs, they can just ignore them, but if you think that kind of thing will get under your skin do not use your main account when posting here, especially if you are posting pictures, use an account whose history you don't mind ditching should worse come to worst and you find yourself stuck with a persistent creeper (don't mean to scare you though, that doesn't happen often, if you receive a creepy PM and want to do something about it rather than just ignore it

1. Take a screen shot of the PM, to tell the truth it really doesn't do much because the people sending creepy PMs don't usually post here.

2. Click the report link under the PM to report the user to the reddit admin

3. block the user so that you no longer have to receive messages from them. 

Another optional step is to post the screen shot over in /r/creepyPMs if you feel like it. =P

On to proposed new rule #2: I think we should make it against the rules to post pictures women have put up of themselves on other parts of reddit (such as in any of the gonewild subreddits or anywhere else), or for an example to be made of out them. Even if the intentions are good, its unlikely any woman that stumbles across this subreddit and sees a picture of herself being commented on is going to feel good about it. If I was in that position I would probably be ashamed and mortified, ""was it really that bad that out of every other girl wearing a bra that doesn't fit, mine is the one you chose as the bad example?"" is probably what would be going through my head in that situation. Even if the chances are one in a million that person will see the post its just not a good thing to do. Thoughts? Comments? I'm kind of in a grey area  as far as the celebrity pics go. If you all feel very strongly about these posts and really like them, maybe they would be better in a separate subreddit, something like r/brasthatdon'tfit

We *DO* need resources to show what bad bras look like though, contribute some before/after pictures to the [Before and After Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15qnxl/before_and_after_sizes/) and add your story there too if you haven't yet. =) Some other resources we would love to get your help with:

I managed to measure my grandmother yesterday and talk her into joining me on a shopping spree today. The numbers pointed to 36F but going down to a 38 band was a big enough change for her already. 

We headed to Change that had been picked clean already as they're having their big biannual sale but I managed to find [a white full coverage bra](http://change.com/int/sofia-1.html) in 38E that worked wonders. It's fantastic at containing really soft (I've heard them being desribed even as liquid) breasts like my grandmothers. There was nothing else left in her size (but I did spy an overflow of 30 and 28 bands in small cups) on sale and she categorically refused to pay more than €20 per bra. I'm really happy I talked her into trying an underwired bra

As there was nothing else even close to fitting in Change we stopped by Triumph. They were also having a sale so selection wasn't the greatest either but after scouring the racks my grandmother fell in love with a taupe/lilac embroidered full cup bra. It only came in 40D but the cups ran generous and my grandmother wouldn't let it go

She was so happy with the purchases she insisted on getting me the matching panties and garter belt to the bra I found for myself. It was also a great learning experience,False,,t5_2s8kf,1374428658.0,,braexpert,t3_1ira0d

I tried explaining to her that the cup size only is a representation of the difference in inches between your band size and bust size, who owns a few bra stores in the state I live in, to get me fitted. Sure enough, I went on their website the lo behold, the fitting guide not only says to add on 4"" to an even band size and 5"" to an odd one, but it also recommends to measure when wearing a bra! It just makes me so frustrated that they even claim to all be fully qualified bra fitters on their site when they're part of the reason why 80% of women are wearing the wrong size.

Until I walked into Lane Bryant.

Now let me just say, and I shrink. And to be honest, sales people have always been really intimidating to me. So after staring at bras, thinking about how I don't know where to even start, I finally got up enough courage to go over to the woman in charge of the fitting room and try to explain my situation. She cuts me short and asks what size I'm currently wearing. When I told her I was actually wearing 4 bras, she laughed, looked me dead in the eye and said 'Good lord girl

I was fucking mortified. As if that wasn't bad enough, OVER THE 4 BRAS I HAD JUST TOLD HER I WAS WEARING. I couldn't believe it. But I was so shocked and embarrassed that when she glanced at the tape measure (after going around part of my boobs once, and looking at it AFTER she pulled it off) and told me that I was a '38DDD', I went and found two in that size. I tried them on and it didn't feel quite right, but when she rapped on the door and asked how it was going, and I told her I didn't think it was right, she told me I 'just didn't know what a good bra felt like.' 
The whole time, but I NEEDED a bra in the worst way possible. So, I walked out of there, 2 bras richer, $70 poorer, and 100% more defeated than I was earlier that day.

Not too long ago, I finally measured myself going off of the Self-measuring guide and came up with a 36H. A huge fucking world of difference. And I'm planning on going by the end of the month (with a friend, so I don't get bullied into the same situation) to get new bras that ACTUALLY fit.

Updated 16 March

**Note Well:**

80% of women are wearing the wrong bra size, go down one cup size each time you go up a band size. For example, if you're a 32C and want to wear a 34 band you would choose a 34B) and please visit /r/ABraThatFits if you are having trouble with the measurements or have any additional questions.


**I. Types**

- Compression: As the name suggests, L, XL. These are not generally recommended for larger busts because they do not provide proper support. There are some exceptions which are listed in part II.

- Encapsulation: This type usually has wires, 38F, 30G, etc.

So you have some new

##General Wear Care

* wear your bra every other day at most to let the elastic relax
* wash your bra after 3 wears - you can stretch it
* however
* don't squeeze or otherwise distort moulded cup bras - this encourages wrinkles to develop on the surface

##Washing

#**Lingerie Washes**

Use a handwash lingerie wash only! Detergents and soaps are too harsh on the elastic. You can read more about detergents

* [Eucalan](http://www.eucalan.com/)
* [Soak](http://www.soakwash.com/)
* [Forever New](http://www.forevernew.com/)
* [Orvus Soap](http://www.joann.com/orvus-quilt-soap-8-ounce/prd34638/)
* [Laundress Delicate Wash](https://store.thelaundress.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=TL&amp;Category_Code=125delWash)

#**Hand washing**

Different linergie washes have different washing instructions

* fill sink with enough lukewarm water to submerge bras fully
* put in lingerie wash - often just a squeeze of the bottle or a spoonful of powder
* [submerge bras fully](http://imgur.com/xjwzf) and let soak for ~10-15 minutes - you may need to weigh them down [with something heavy](http://imgur.com/DqceK)
* depending on the brand used
* if for some reason
* drain sink of water
* [gently push on bras against the sink](http://imgur.com/YWhp0) to release extra water - DO NOT WRING
* place bras in [a single layer](http://imgur.com/FMIEA) on a dry towel
* gently stretch the wire channels to prevent shrinking

#**Special Moulded Cup Notes**

* when squeezing out water
* try to do all moulded cups together to prevent accidental distortion
* when putting moulded cups in a towel

#**Machine Washing**

Using a machine is not recommended, there will be minimal damage caused by the machine.

* make sure you are still using a handwash or delicates wash!
* do not wash bras with items that could pull at the straps
* close all bras on the tightest hook to prevent accidental pulling
* put all bras in a mesh lingerie bag
* you can also try a [bra ball](http://braballs.com/) but they look questionable at best
* wash only on the ""delicate"" cycle - other cycles will be too rough


#**Drying**

There are many different ""ways"" to dry bras, as well as cause distortion! Here are a few suggestions for drying:

* hang to dry on a clothes rack or [on hangers](http://imgur.com/SGMCP)
* pin to a clothes line
* lay flat on a water-resistant surface (e.g. a coffee table


##Storage

There are a variety of ways to store your bras! It all depends on your personal wardrobe space and how you like to organize your clothing. Here are some suggestions and tips to consider for keeping your bras in their best condition:

* hang bras from clothes hangers by both straps
* clip bras to skirt hangers
* hook bra closed and lay flat in a dresser - you can save space by folding soft cups in half
* hang bras from clothes hangers by the gore (my personal lazy method)


##Travel Care

* always close bras when travelling to prevent accidentally damaging bras
* carry in a mesh lingerie bag or other separate
* put moulded cup bras in a plastic container to prevent squishing the cups - in this instance

##Bonus Tips and Tricks

* if you're feeling extra lazy
* wash all like colours together to prevent fading - though I'm usually too lazy to do so
* you can also make colours last longer by matching the bra colour to your shirt colour
* when putting your bra on
* there are a ton of other tips in the comments - feel free to add your own

I'm actually a dude who's always felt a little out of place with his gender. Never enough to go so far as a sex change, but I've always wondered how women stand wearing them because they're so uncomfortable! I have a little bit of breast tissue, but the only bras I could fit into before were AA or AAA cups.

So I come to ABTF and measure myself. I get 35"" under the bust and 37"" over. My inclination before this community would have been to go with a 36"" band, so they measure up a lot more when I'm leaning over according to MWB's guide. It's pretty damn amazing to have a bra size that isn't completely niche or meaningless.

I had no idea where we were going but we ended up in front of a small lingerie store and I figured out what my present was. To say I was ecstatic is an extreme understatement. The store was [Coeur Intimate Apparel &amp; Toys](http://coeurlingerie.com/) in Philadelphia and I have nothing but AMAZING things to say about it. 

We didn't know this, was so sweet and acommodating. I told her I was from out of town and would be leaving the next day so she took me into the back and told me she would do a fitting for me in the store no problem, even though they were technically closed. Before she even had me take my bra off, she told me everything I should know about how a bra should fit; a lot of the same stuff you find on here, i.e. support comes from the band not the straps, band size and cup size and not independent, scoop and swoop

An hour later, I have never been comfortable and have always hated the way my breasts looked. For the first time in my life, I felt comfortable and loved the way my bras fit me. I was practically jumping around the store and hugging my boyfriend, thanking him over and over. 

The bras I have been wearing were 40Ds. I walked out with 2 bras that were 36Es. My jaw hit the floor when she told me the size of the bra I was wearing that fit me like a glove.

Next time you see someone trying to give their advice about bras, we've all done it, sometimes it is unavoidable. But I think we should stop posting these kinds of things here. All it does is encourage us to all gang up on one person, and I doubt doing that is going to make them want to come here and join our community. I think maybe we can all, myself included I can totally admit that, work on holding back a bit. Maybe instead of going into long rants and starting arguments we can try to remember that these are people too, and how would I feel if someone came up to me and told me I was totally wrong about something I feel I know a lot about?

I also included many stories told here on this subreddit from women who are now in the correct size, as well as many pictures of my own and some from various bloggers (which I credited) such as Thin and Curvy's fantastic [set of photos](http://www.thinandcurvy.com/2011/05/where-to-find-26-and-24-band-bras-and.html). Don't worry, I explained them all, too!

I also wrote a bit of an ""introduction, here it is (if not, feel free to skip this portion):

---

**INTRODUCTION**

In the United States, B, C, D, et cetra) as representative of breast size. A is small, B is slightly larger, C about average, and DD very busty

Many women I’ve talked to are fitted at Victoria’s Secret. It’s accessible, they have adorable bras! Unfortunately, Victoria’s Secret uses the +4 method (adding 4” to  your band size – this is the 32, 34, 36 [and so on] number). This method is great if you’re creating antiquated bras with no stretch, but it doesn’t work for modern bras which are made out of lovely, modern fabrics and elastics. This means that a bra for a 32” underbust might measure 25” unstretched

So if this is the case, that is a 32-38 AA-DD. If my math is correct, that’s only 24 sizes. Unfortunately, this means an ill-fitted bra for a majority of women, since that is only a fraction of the range of bra sizes. As a result, many women experience bands that ride up, strapless bras that constantly fall down, cups that are way too small

In short, not the bra!

In turn, we are flabbergasted when more letters are introduced and suddenly we’re sliding diagonally – from a 34C to a 28FF or even a 32A to a 30D. After all, in a culture that has been (unfortunately) led to believe our breasts are to blame and “D breasts” are large while “DD breasts” are even larger, it seems ridiculous to think that your petite A cups are closer to the Christina Hendricks DD cup. And even though Miss Hendricks is certainly not a DD, you can see how this visualization and incorrect information perpetuated by our ignorance of proper bra sizing and fitting is a shock to many people.

* **A picture of yourself** - either full-body or at least waist-up (a picture of just your chest area isn't the most helpful) in either a bra or clothing (no nudity

* **Your usual bra size** (please only submit if you know and are wearing your [correct bra size](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) - altered bras are fine)

I want to educate women on how a bra should fit

I have so much passion for bra fitting...but I get so annoyed by VS as a company sometimes because we have such limited sizes. (nothing smaller than a 32 band) (nothing bigger than DDD cups) and also that they don't make it a priority to teach their staff to be competent bra fitters.

I'll interview for the position sometime this week and will pour my heart out... If I don't get the position

Out of curiosity I compared this to the number of views on my other imgur albums, these numbers make much better sense.

I did notice two other albums that had a sizeable number of views. The first - over 3000 views - was the photos for a [PSA I posted about ill fitting wires](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1b5jzi/the_perils_of_wearing_tootall_wires_psa_nsfw/) which contained shots of my bare breasts. Another still - [my first bikini fit check](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1esg3p/in_case_any_other_34jish_ladies_out_there_thought/) - has **over 7000**.

It's understandable that people check out our fit albums for reasons other than... well, requests for assistance. It's understandable that some albums have more value in the context of those alternative motives than others. While I was surprised at just *how big* those view counts were on my albums, I certainly can't say I was surprised to see higher viewership than what traffic on this sub would warrant.

That being said, but something I hadn't really considered before. Sure, I expected the photos to be seen. Sure, I expect the posts where the photos were linked to be seen - even by people for whom they weren't explicitly intended (our community here on ABTF). But I hadn't really ever thought about someone taking those URLs and posting them elsewhere outside of this context for an entirely different community to consume.

I'm not a shy lady, I'm not really a private person in general, so there's not a lot of reason for me to take away learning resources that might benefit someone else, even if that comes at the cost of becoming part of someone's spank bank or a target of anonymous ridicule.

Many of you, jewelry, and the backgrounds of your photos. Many of you would not be comfortable having your breasts sexualized out of your control, without your consent, and when our objective here is to approach breasts with a nonsexual and quite pragmatic philosophy: bras that fit for comfort and support and confidence. Many of you would not be able to brush yourself off from being judged and scrutinized by thousands of prying eyes who do not have as positive intentions or supportive attitudes as our sub's core viewership.

If you are in that category of those who cannot shrug away those numbers, only to find that the photos are missing; but that is a small price to pay for your safety and peace of mind.

The closest thing I could find to my size was a 36D. The band was way too big, why can't I find any bras to fit that figure? I rarely see bras above a D unless the band is 38 or higher. Do they think all thin women have tiny boobs? The inverse applies too. I never see bras for 38+ band sizes under a C, maybe. And I'm not saying I have the ideal boobs. They have stretch marks and sag, because that's how NATURAL big boobs behave. Gravity actually has an effect on them. And it's fine if you want a get a boob job to have big, perky boobs so they look good braless. But I don't want one. And I can't find a bra in my size, so I'm assuming that means the stores want me to go braless? But I don't think that's what they really want, because if I went braless someone's eye would get taken out.

I can't find a bra in my size, since 8th grade) I've cried in the dressing room because shopping for a bra is SO STRESSFUL. If you're small, you need a pushup bra. If you're big, you need a breast reduction. You can't order online because how would you be sure the bra fits. The only size you can consistently find across most band sizes is a C. Is the universe trying to tell me that I need to be a C? Because seriously, this is frustrating. I get cat calls and whistles if I wear anything tighter than a loose t-shirt, but I can't even find a normal bra? Why is there so much sexualization of a size that rarely even exists naturally, but when it does exist naturally, just because that's the way I'm naturally shaped? All through middle school and junior high I wore oversized tee shirts almost exclusively because I was so ashamed of my body and girls would tell me to ""get a breast reduction"" when I didn't need one because there's nothing wrong with my back. I literally got called ""tits"" by a guy once in high school. And I'm over that by now because I'm older and don't really care what people think of me anymore,False,

[Here are some pics of the ""finished"" bra](http://imgur.com/a/AbEWn). My main issue with this bra is that it's quite ""matronly"" looking

Also, the pieces would be proportionally bigger so this would be even more difficult? Considering the hooks only come in one size.

(pics removed, but these are issues I usually expect in an off-the-rack bra too. I considered buying wider wires than the pattern called for because I anticipated I would need them, but the thing is.. the wires are as long as the wire channels, which are as wide as the cups. If I wanted wider wires I'd have to make fairly major modifications. As it is, the wires take up the whole channel and I think there's supposed to be a bit of room. It's pretty comfortable, considering the wires are too narrow. Also, my scoop &amp; swoop doesn't really stay in this. I probably won't wear this as part of my normal rotation or anything.

1370994025.0,1g5qr4,Jockey store experience.,I-have-feet,86,6,8,"Out of curiosity

The inside of the store was big, and they had two staff in a nearly empty store. The store does not have bras hanging free on the racks, but instead had one table as a demo displaying their sizing system, and the other displaying their five? different styles of bras if I remember correctly. Two were underwired padded, one was underwired unpadded, one was wireless padded, and the other was wireless unpadded. 

One of their fitters immediately came up to me and started explaining the concept of their fitting system to me. I agreed to try it out and was sent into the fitting room. 

The fitting rooms have a TV

There was a robe hanging to put on, from what little I could tell from her shirt. 

Then she measured my band over the robe I was wearing

The moulded cups are not at all my breast shape, this didn't work. I could pull the bra away from my body by the center gore several inches, and could not even get my armpit boob into the cups. 

The fitter was reluctant to get me a smaller band as she (repeatedly whenever I asked for a smaller size) said that it causes back fat

Eventually we worked down to a 34. She tried adjusting the (far too wide set on me) shoulder straps by tightening them in place. When I pointed out that this was causing the straps to fold at the base in to not fall off my shoulders, she said that for women with my shape (I can only assume that she means ladies on the bigger side of non-plus sizes, as I'm currently a 12-14) this works and prevents ""back fat."" 

She told me I should give the non-wired bra a try, 6-34 and a 7-32. In both cases the band is too big, and the cups fold over and droop with my boobs in them. They look dismal. She tells me to put on my shirt and try them on then, because she's had customers who have thought the nonwired bra looked bad on until they put a shirt on. It didn't just look a bit funny, it was hanging onto my breasts like a sling. 

I also retry the moulded bra in a 7-32 and the underwired nonmoulded bra in a 7-32. In both cases the band is too big and the cups are not of the right proportion

I will note that throughout the process she was extremely nice and did not pressure me to buy. She explained that the bras are ""supposed to fit"" 75% of women but they wont pressure women to buying one if they don't fit. With better training she definitely had the personality to be a good fitter

One thing I noted throughout trying on all of these bras is that they really do not appear to be worth $60 in quality. In the moulded bras, sears, etc. 

Unfortunately, the shape was off, and there was really only one shape available. Combined with staff that don't seem to be very well trained, very stretchy bands, and bras that don't seem to be of the quality they cost, I wasn't impressed. Had they offered what I assume my actual size in their system would be (an 8-30 or so) in more shapes and better quality, I'd have been much more impressed. 

Then I went off to H&amp;M to check out the larger cup sizes they're supposedly stocking now. Only one model had above a D cup in stock, is a UK E.) I asked and they said they don't stock it smaller than a 36 band (at least at that store.) The bra was very cute and was of pretty good construction for a $17 bra, even though it wasn't my size.

Someone should start a bra company that has consultants who come to your house and measure you and sell bras. It would be like Mary Kay or Slumber Parties

They could have magazine type things with pictures of models who wear different sizes so people can see what a real 30H looks like

They could also take a bunch of bras with them for people to try on. That would be kind of a hard part because there are soooo many sizes. I was thinking that they could just take a ton of sizes and have the style alternate for each one (So a 28C balconette, 28F t-shirt bra, then start over at 28FF.) If they had enough space to carry them it would be better if they could take 1 or 2 kinds of bra in every size and then just take a few rando sizes of other ones. That way people can try on something that is their actual size, but they would be able to get really close if they didn't like the style.

The company would try to make the sizing as regular as possible between styles. We would probably only make a few basic types of bras

It's really hard to tell just by looking, and I don't mind helping someone find their shape at all, you guys need to meet us halfway here.  Even experienced bra fitting bloggers like June from Braless in Brasil admit that they cannot tell what shape someone's naked breast is simply by looking.  Sometimes it's really obvious, but most of the time it's not because most people do not have an extreme breast shape (like extreme full on bottom, extreme narrowness etc...).  A lot of breast characteristics cannot be gauged by just looking at a picture over the internet.

So I propose that at the bare minimum

**Describe common fit issues you have with bras that would otherwise be well fitting.  Make sure to name specific brands

**If you feel comfortable, 45 degree angle view, back view, whatever areas you feel are problematic with the fit of your bra.**

**Include your measurements, underbust extremely tight (like trying to break the tape measure), bust leaning over, bust standing, and bust on your back.**

She was wearing a 38C. I measured her and it came out to a 34F.

1374344984.0,1ipge7,[MOD POST] A Heads Up,wambrita,86,13,171,"**EDIT 7/21: To increase transparency and to try and get a community-favored method of determining on who gets flair and how we would go about selecting the individuals

I'm going to be very candid here and blunt

Several things:

**Flair:**You may notice that some of us now have flair. I want to ensure the community this is something that was heavily discussed and ultimately agreed upon to implement. There have been legitimate concerns about quality of posts and advice given to newcomers from those who are not as well versed in bra fitting and are unintentionally giving the OP bad advice. I'm NOT going to give examples or call anyone out, do not cop an attitude.** Be graceful about the correction; it's not an opportunity to belittle and insult your intellect, but it's an opportunity to teach and inform so you can learn more about the nuances of bra fitting. I'm a mod, and I've been here for quite a while and I've learned a lot, but I do not know all, nor do I claim to. If I'm unsure of the advice I give; I always post a disclaimer to take it with a grain of salt and I of course ALWAYS apologize for giving incorrect information when someone comes in and let me know I have done so, and I have edited posts to remove the misinformation. I would have liked the flair to wait until an announcement was made, that it'll hopefully be a bit more obvious on what advice they should probably follow. 

It's upsetting for someone to come in, they inadvertently take the wrong advice and order the wrong bras.. get the wrong bras and get frustrated when it doesn't work the first time around, then just go ""These women have no clue what they are talking about!"" and give up on trying to find a bra that fits and goes back to their ill fitting bras and never come back. Bra fitting is a science with a little bit of geometry added in. You may be able to get it right the first time, but this is also very unlikely. It's unfortunately not realistic to toss up measurements, get recommendations and then order bras and then have the heavenly choir come down with a beam of light and start singing a heavenly choir at you. Figuratively speaking anyway. Even now, 8 months after finding this subreddit and immersing myself in here.. I still have not found my perfect bras.. the ones I have right now are as good as it's going to get for the time being.

**Memes:** It was never official nor added to the sidebar -and I fully intend to change this sometime this weekend- but let's restrict posting funny pictures and memes to Monday. I have also suggested we make a catch all ""MEME MONDAY"" thread on Mondays and very similar to the weekly discussions, and those who enjoy having a chuckle or giggle during the week can go ahead and pop in and look at the memes and pictures and whatever. The focus of this subreddit is to help ladies to get into better fitting bras, but yeah we need some fun injected every once in a while. I think we may be able to start implementing this starting next Monday, unless there's any objection. If we see stuff crop up, we can just direct folks to posting in the weekly thread. **Let's do this in a friendly and kind tone, ya'll.**

And one more thing that I feel is extremely important: **When someone new comes in and posts for measurement check or sizing help

1373560732.0,1i37yo,[Mod Post] PSA about taking measurements!,wambrita,82,12,25,"Hi all! I want to start by saying hello to all the new comers

However

So, while my standing up measurement was 36.25"". My breasts are far from being firm, so that didn't make sense. On a whim, I decided to check the tape placement by using the forward facing camera on my phone (I don't own a hand mirror large enough to see the entirety of my breasts) and discovered where I was placing the tape was about an inch or so lower than where the widest parts of my breasts at, and then pulling it up and around the widest part of my breasts. I quickly scooted around and wiggled until the tape was coming straight up around the widest parts of my breast, and then discovered that my laying down measurement was not 36.5"" like I thought, but it was 35""!!

I have started asking random new users to double check their laying down measurements to make sure the tape was placed correctly. In one case

Of course, their laying measurement can be equal or slightly larger than their standing measurement or close to their leaning over measurement. So, with that being said, if you see someone who's leaning and laying measurements are close, please take breast firmness into consideration; perhaps ask to confirm if they have firm breasts or not, rather than assume they did it wrong. ^I ^recently ^did ^this, ^woops... I do not know if women with shallow breasts will get a similar result to a woman with firm breasts or not. *(If you are a confirmed shallow shape and could do this for me

I have added the following tip to the visual fitting guide in italics; **""Please make sure that when taking the laying down measurement that you are pulling the tape straight up around the widest part of your bust with the help of a mirror or a spotter.

1371831312.0,1gsuz6,Bravangelism Etiquette,Melle515,81,11,37,"As the title describes
I came up with a few general guidelines on my own, or remove something. I will edit the original post to better exemplify the responses here, so this post can be used for future reference. Happy bravangelizing :)

**When dealing with anyone**

* Be polite

* Be respectful

* If they're comfortable enough to give measurements, problems, etc. 

* Remember that the end goal is to help and not leave someone feeling offended

**When dealing with internet strangers**

* Consider if the advice is in appropriate context; such as someone asking for advice in female fashion advice or someone asking about breast reductions in bigboobproblems problems when a good bra may save them the surgery
* Show genuine kindness/concern/a desire to help
* Be polite (say please, clarify if something is taken out of context, etc)
* Try to help them realize that there could be a better bra (the why of bravangelism)- [before and after pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15qnxl/before_and_after_sizes/) - this gives anecdotal stories that shows the benefits both functionally, [Don't believe your new size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/quick#wiki_learning_what_bra_sizes_really_mean), Visual aids and links to posts such as this one [thinandcurvy](http://www.thinandcurvy.com/2011/05/where-to-find-26-and-24-band-bras-and.html) help further demonstrate the difference in aesthetics a good bra can have.
* After you've demonstrated that there is such a thing as a ""better bra""
* Consider pm-ing them so as to avoid ""calling them out in public"". Some people may be shy and would rather be told privately.
* Some may also find PM's too private.
* At the end of the day
* Don't wish them boob problems for not listening (I'm guilty of this in my head...)

**When dealing with strangers in real life**

* Just don't do it
Some have made it known that they would find it incredibly rude if a stranger approaches them about bras in real life. Please think long and hard about whether its possible that you can indirectly help a stranger on bras (that's kind of intimate!

* Be anonymous
* Leave a business card somewhere detailing proper bra fitting and resources; do not hand it to someone! The point is anonymity

* More direct - only do this if it can be an off-hand comment not directed at someone in particular or that would allow them to inquire about fit

Theoretical situation (I've seen it a couple of times posted here): You hear a lady (or a couple of ladies) talking about how their bras don't quite feel right. Or maybe there are a bunch of ""weird"" bra sizes and they're complaining about not being able to find theirs.

* Approach by slipping into the presented situation and drawing the topic of bras onto yourself so as not to be seen as critiquing the other ladies' bosoms themselves. (For example: Oh yeah, or dismiss you. 
* If they ask
* Be polite
* Accept that not everyone will listen; still their boobs/bra
* Please please please do not approach someone directly about the fit of their bra - quite a few people have made it known that it would make them uncomfortable and isn't the point of bravangelism comfort? Be respectful

**Dealing with closer relationships**

* If you know them well
* Be polite
* Be patient
* Accept defeat if its time

Anddd that's what I have so far. It obviously needs some work so feedback would be awesome :)

All my life, and for years I've been wearing a 34A. I found this subreddit this morning, right before I went out shopping for my birthday. I noticed that my bra band was riding up and I was having all sorts of side-boob. Before, I hadn't really thought much of it. I'm the girl with small boobs. I buy bras most of my friends wore in middle school.

But everything changed today. I didn't have enough time to measure myself or have someone do it for me, I always thought this was a problem with the band, which was why I'd size up to a 34 band. I was also still having some side-boob, although it wasn't really that much for me to pay much attention. At least, in the past I wouldn't have. Today I knew better, and although I felt a little skeptical, I told my mom to help me find a 32C.

She said I was crazy, it fit like a dream. I even got re-dressed, walked back out into the store, and dragged my mom back in the dressing room with me, just so she could check to make sure I wasn't just imagining it out of wishful thinking. I wasn't. I am a 32C.

That was when I realized how arbitrary most of our ideas of ""small boobs"" vs. ""big boobs"" are. Like... I don't know whether I'm still the small-boobed girl I've been all my life just because I found out I'm actually 2 cup sizes bigger. My boobs are the same

So I browsed through their website and entered all of their bras in [Yet Another Google Docs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdFlqZnVBMEFtQjJnNmZ5RUtackpqT3c&amp;usp=sharing).

* Percentage of bras with the word ""sexy"" or ""sexier"" or ""sexiest"" in the description: 57%
* Percentage of bras that can be worn strapless: 12%
* Percentage of bras that have moulded cups: ~~79%~~ **75%**
* Percentage of bras with some amount of push-up: 45%
* Percentage of bras sold that are unlined: ~~5%~~ **7%**
* Percentage of bras that are either demi or plunge in shape: 67%
* Percentage of bras that are either demi or plunge in shape
* Percentage of sports bras that have some amount of push-up: 25%

Various notes: ""unique"" means bras with a separate complete name/listing (everything except color differences).  I'm fairly certain I got all of them, lightly lined moulded cup bras, as far as I can tell.  Also, the line between ""plunge"" and ""demi"" is pretty blurry for their bras, so I did the best I could assigning labels.  Every bra called ""Perfect Coverage"" I called three-quarters cup, even though that may or may not be the best description.

1359672808.0,17npfs,I saw an interesting bra website (True&amp;Co) on HelloGiggles. I went ahead and called the company. Here is the conversation I had. ,nifflerqueen,79,10,19,"Hello Ladies!

Apologizes for the awkward title and the long wall of text ahead. I thought you may be interested in the small journey I just embarked. 

I saw an interesting [article on HelloGiggles](http://hellogiggles.com/finding-the-perfect-bra-without-some-strange-lady-touching-your-boobs) about a bra website called [True&amp;Co](https://trueandco.com/how_it_works). The author explains:
 &gt; *You fill out an online form, then keep the ones you like and send back the ones you don’t with specifics about why they weren’t for you. You are only charged for the pieces you keep and return shipping is free.*

I was excited to hear about this great company until I read the author was a 34A. I understand that some women may be this size

So I head over to the website to take their quiz to get my correct bra size. The company prides itself in finding the perfect bra without having to measure oneself. I end up with the same ill-fiting brasize I have now. Despite being intrigued by the concept

**1. Where are you located?**

&gt;Their office is located in San Francisco (a road trip away from me :D ). Their warehouse is located on the east coast. 

**2. Do you take into account women with ill-fitting bras ordering more ill-fitting bras not knowing what a good fit looks like?**

&gt;The women explained the process of ordering five bras and being able to return those that don't fit. She said the customers do end up with the correct size by trial and error. Free returns help. I said my opinion is that most women do not wear the correct bra size due to the fact that they do not know the signs of an ill-fitting bra. We giggled about Victoria's Secret placing me at a 36C when I should be wearing a 30E. 
&gt;
&gt;She also explained that the company is rather new and they hope to add more to the website

**3. How would you recommend that I measure myself?**

&gt;She said that it really depends on what each manufacturer says and sizes can vary from company to company. She explained to measure my band size and then add (cringe) how ever many inches as the manufacturer says. 
&gt;
&gt;She paused. In the kindest voice I could muster

**4. What is the smallest band you carry? What is the largest cup size in that band?**

&gt;Unfortunately the smallest band they carry is a 30. She could not remember what the largest cup is for that band. I do know they have at least a 30E. I did not ask about larger band sizes. I'm sorry.

&gt;She explained True&amp;Co plans on carrying a larger selection of bands in the future. However

I don't want to trivialize the decision to have surgery

A good friend of mine had a breast reduction when she was 15, so she's really embarrassed by the current appearance of her breasts and how they've reacted to the weight fluctuations. I just keep thinking that if she were in the right bra from the start, she wouldn't have had to go through all that. 

Here's my question: based on the fact that most women don't know how to measure themselves properly and are wearing the wrong size

EDIT: I want to make it very clear that I am not judging anyone for or being dismissive of the decision to have breast reduction surgery. Having surgery is not an easy decision, implant, reduction, etc, is incredibly personal. I apologize if anyone felt like I was dismissive or judgmental. That was not my intention at all. We have to make the decisions that are best for us and our lifestyles, and different people will make different decisions based on a multitude of factors.

The interwebs tell me this fits similarly to the Marcie and the George, there is a very mild amount of wrinkling in the bottom of the cups, but this was fixed by doing a better swoop-and-scoop than I did when I put the bra on. I also have (since yesterday) realized that this bra wasn't sitting high enough on my sternum-- the underwires weren't sitting right at the breast root, and by moving it up just a touch and adjusting the strap, it helped the issue.

I find the band to be snug-- maybe a cm or so more snug than other Cleo bras of the same size, but it doesn't feel that way.

Sigh. 

I try to explain that cup size is dependent on band size. I try to explain that even though I have a shallow shape

Today I was telling my friend I wish I could find padded push up bras made in my size (36FF or 38F depending on the style.) She was like- ""just look at Dillard's! I know you think you need size FFF or whatever but I know tons of girls with way bigger boobs than you and they can buy bras at normal places.""

Also, even when we went down band sizes. At least I got her out of a B. She still had spillage on the sides in the bras we settled on because she refused to try on anything bigger. 

What will it take to change the mentality of so many women? Even though I didn't know a lot about bras before I found this subreddit

My measurements in case they're relevant:

underbust super tight - 28""

underbust just snug - 30.5""

bust standing - 37""

bust bent over - 38""



I asked at the couple department stores I have nearby (Macy's and JC Penney's) and wasn't surprised to hear that they didn't really have anything near my size

I drove over and the lady who greeted me was friendly and said she'd get me started and then the expert would be back from wherever she was and she'd advise me on fit. I told her I measured as a 30/32 F/G and she gave me a couple 32 Fs which were the closest they had. I went into the dressing room and by the time I had the first one on the expert had arrived.

I thought the bra was a little small in the cups but the expert told me it looked perfect, so I just wanted to see a variety and explore what fit me best. 

She came back with a couple 32 Fs, telling me ""the cups run large."" That one was so small even she admitted it, and came back with a 34 D of the same band. It was too small in the cups and too large in the band, but she tried her best to convince me that it was perfect and asked me if I was ready to pick one. I pointed out the breast tissue poking out of the cups under my arms, and the gore squished over my boobs instead of against my chest and she told me ""those are just things you need to accept as a woman. You can't be perfect."" I reminded her that I measured myself as a much different size than she was trying to fit me in, and she got a little ruder and said ""there's no way you're that size. You can't fit a bra by measuring. You're dreaming, sweetheart."" 

I guess I'll try ordering a few offline from somewhere with free returns

It took me a while to put this baby on. I'm not sure why

The underwires on this bra feel perfect. I mean it. **Perfect** for me. And the top lace is perfect. And the lift is perfect. And the firm band feels perfect.

The only possible thing I can criticize on this bra is that straps are still pretty wide set

I am thrilled with the improvement this is over even my Cleo Marcie

The silhouette is pointier than I normally go for

I am sort of on a bra high right now about this, can you recommend any similar bras?

**Edit:** Thanks everybody for being so supportive and awesome :) After half a day of wear through driving, and swift walking in a cross-chest backpack, I am still really pleased. The top of the gore might need to be bent out a touch, but for the first time I am staying inside my underwires without adjusting every 5 minutes. The straps do seem to want to be right on the tangent of my shoulders - about 45 degrees off of level - but they don't ever fall all the way down so if I'm in a t-shirt then whatever haha.

* Averaged ratio for each style

So WHAT exactly is an A-cup? I saw a very small-chested woman post a picture and someone said they could ""just tell they weren't an A-cup."" As a fellow flat-chested girl

Again, how small do you have to be to be an A-cup? Yes I know a 34A (what I wear) is basically a 30C or something (so I've heard) but is it truly impossible for a person to be a 34A? I always see comments that it's better to go up to the 30C. So, why is that better? What's the difference? 

It's just weird for me because I've always considered being an ""A-cup"" as a pretty big part of my identity (hahaha) so to hear that I should go up to a B or C is weird to me.  

Also, I don't think most other people understand the whole bra sizing thing, at all. Ask any ""civilian"" out there, man, woman, etc, and all of them would probably say, D=huge. So

I've been taking phytoestrogens for a few months now to enhance my chest, it's hard to get them to cover the horizontal area of my chest. Seeing well fitting bras, I've noticed the cup tends to wrap around the side of the body a little bit... but my bras never do.

I measure 38 inches around the bust leaning over, right? But every 36 band I've tried is too loose. I have to wear a 34 to get any support at all. I think my shoulder blades exaggerate my underbust measurement, and maybe my bust measurement too because I can't fill that cup volume at all in most bras.

Best fit I've found as been Timpa Duet in 34C. But I end up with escaped breast tissue between the cups and my arms, but only if I swoop and scoop very aggressively and the extra tissue falls out if I move at all! But band-wise, all the 34 inch bands I've tried have been really good.

1352437844.0,12weha,Transformation - picture and story.,jillcicle,63,5,15,"When I first started bra shopping in the women's section instead of just wearing training bras (around age 13)

I hit age 15 or so and realized the bras I had were not cutting it. I measured myself at home, I discovered that some people had to use a different technique, measuring ribcage instead of overbust. Unfortunately, the site I found still did the +4 measurement. 34D sounded more likely, and when I tried them on and found that my boobs actually fit into the cups of the bra, I was happy.

By my senior year of high school, they were sad and embarrassing - I had no cleavage to speak of, and even though i wore a bigger bra size than some of my friends, my chest looked the same or smaller. I decided that I must have had saggy boobs, and proceeded to become ashamed and bitter about my chest :(

Last year,) I hesitantly moved into a 34DD (US), feeling as though I had somehow manipulated the numbers to make myself sound good - but the bras fit. Well, sort of. I wasn't getting any lift, and when I tightened the straps enough to get the girls to perk up at all, the band ended up literally on top of my shoulder blades.

I sat down with google

Now, I simply followed Linda's recommendation and went down a band size (and up a cup size accordingly.) The Victoria's Secret in my smallish town didn't even stock the 32DDDs, but I tried on the 32DDs and realized I needed the triple D offline (US sizing again, obv.) I probably would have stuck with this happily until my boobs changed size except for one thing - I was a broke, broke college student. (Still am, actually.) I couldn't afford bras in my size, which tended to be around 60 dollars from the Victoria's Secret website and never went on sale. I didn't even think any other companies made the size!

Finally

In all seriousness, as well - and significantly less back pain. I have scoliosis and my old bands would ride up and put pressure right across the problem area - but now they stay in place!

So anyway

Do you think you have shallow breasts?  Do you have no clue at all?  Do you not even know what shallow breasts look like? Do you have no idea what kind of bras to buy for shallow breasts?  Well

**What are shallow breasts with a wide root?**

Simply put, a person with shallow breasts has breast tissue that starts all the way up near the collarbone.

**Okay

[Here's a diagram of some different shallow breasts vs. someone with more projection](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnIpeGDU2WE/UEYGVHZOCgI/AAAAAAAAA20/AkCVXUtLzcE/s1600/shallow+breasts.jpg) (mostly SFW).  You'll notice that the slope of the breast starts up much higher than the far right breasts.  In addition

**Right

Luckily, but there doesn't seem to be much projection going on.

**What are some other possible indicators of shallow breasts with wide roots?**

* Many bras, but you never seem to be able to fill out the cup itself.
* The bra size you come up with using [The Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) seems to be giving you a size that is much too large from what you look like.  Note: this is different than the sticker shock of learning your new size (for example
* Professional fitters often get your band size correct
* Shallow shapes are extremely common in cupsizes A-E and bandsizes 28-32.  However
* When you try on an unlined bra
* You are trans*\.
* You would describe your breasts as more teardrop-shaped than round/spherical.

**What are some things to look for when choosing a bra?**

Finding bras that work for ladies with shallow breasts and wide roots is a challenge.  Most bras have too much projection

* The cups have only vertical seams
* The top edge of the cups is as close to horizontal as possible.
* The top edge is open (vertical)

Please note: these are just suggestions for new bras, refer back to these three points for guidance.

Also note: many bras labeled as *balconette* follow the three guidelines above

**Which bras will most likely work for someone with shallow breasts?**

* Lepel Fiore Padded Plunge (Please note that the bras from Spring 2013 have a slightly different cut and do not work as well.  They also may make your breasts look especially pointy.  Avoid the colors from SS13
* Cleo Juna (and its sisters, Ellie, Martha, Poppy, Rihanna, Rita, and Sadie)
* Cleo Marcie
* b.tempt'd Ciao Bella
* Cleo George
* Curvy Kate Tempt Me
* Lepel Fiore Padded Balconette
* Fauve Merissa Half Cup
* OnlyHer Tabasco Plunge
* Timpa Duet Lace Underwire Demi
* Betsey Johnson Eyelet Lace Demi
* Cleo Brooke
* Ewa Michalak CH line
* Ewa Michalak HP line
* Freya Patsy Half Cup
* Sugar Shape Dolce Vita
* H&amp;M leopard print strapless bra

**Which bras are moderately likely to work; ie

* Calvin Klein Seductive Comfort Customized Lift
* Fauve Brianna Half Cup
* Fauve Isobel Padded Plunge
* Freya Deco Plunge
* Gossard Esprit balcony
* Lepel Bouquet strapless
* Masquerade Rhea
* Masquerade Rosetti
* OnlyHer Latte Plunge
* Panache Harmony
* Cleo Lucy
* Curvy Kate Thrill Me
* Ewa Michalak CHP line
* by Caprice Gardenia
* Cleo Bonnie
* Masquerade Georgiana
* Masquerade Maia
* Cleo Jude
* Freya Deco Half Cup
* Freya Erin Half Cup
* Cleo Frances
* Fauve Aurelia Padded Half Cup
* Fauve Celine Padded Half Cup
* Freya Libby Half Cup
* Masquerade Delphi
* Masquerade Hestia

**Which bras are unlikely to work for shallow breasts?**

* OnlyHer half cups (Chili
* Curvy Kate Tease Me

All of this information comes from **[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdDVYb0RJcHZoUEE4WFZrUkk2ZFN3Y0E&amp;usp=sharing)**, as always, if you wish to be added to the spreadsheet, just shoot me a message and I'd be happy to add you.

Here's a brief list of other information that can be gathered from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdDVYb0RJcHZoUEE4WFZrUkk2ZFN3Y0E&amp;usp=sharing):

* Which bras to buy if you're looking for a specific shape
* If you have a smaller or larger band size
* Other bras that may or may not work
* Information on a very select number of brands/styles of swimwear
* Specifically which bras have worked for other people in your size range

I would like to take a minute to emphasize that last point.  Those of you with larger shallow breasts often show different fitting trends than those with smaller shallow breasts.  As the former is much less common

**Are these bras sold in brick and mortar stores?**

If you weren't already aware, and Dillards.  Nordstrom sells 30+ bands and cups A-J (UK).  However, a majority of the bras they sell do not work well for shallow breasts, and most fitters will not be aware of the limitations that those with shallow breasts face.

Beyond chain stores

**How about online retailers?**

American retailers:

* Nordstrom (free shipping both ways; 30+ bands)
* Amazon (free shipping both ways with Amazon Prime; 28+ bands)
* Zappos (free shipping both ways; 30+ bands)
* BreakoutBras (not especially shallow-bust friendly
* Asos (free shipping both ways; 28+ bands)
* The Little Bra Company (28-38 bands; A-C cups)
* eBay

Non-American retailers:

* Figleaves (only have to pay return shipping to their facility in the US; 28+ bands)
* Brastop (28+ bands; D+ cups)
* eBay.co.uk

**Is there any way that bras that don't generally work for shallow/wide breasts can be made into shallower- and wider-cupped bras?**

This idea is in its infancy, then altering them down to the correct band size.  Along these lines, if you find that a bra is just on the cusp of being too narrow and/or too deep, consider going up a sister size.  Caveat: this will work much less often for shorter people, as the straps will be set too wide in the back, and will be much more prone to falling down.  Here is [the blog post that kick-started this idea](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2013/04/what-sister-size-bras-look-like.html).  As more people experiment and document this theory, I hope to update this section with more information and links.

I've heard a number of random bra sizes thrown around as ""average"" and have no idea where the source is. So I decided to calculate it myself. I used two datasets.

First

In this dataset

The second is the CAESAR dataset, ten years ago). In this dataset, the average bust measurement for adult women is 36.6 in and underbust is 30 in - giving us a 30E or F again for our theoretical average woman. 

ANSUR: http://mreed.umtri.umich.edu/mreed/downloads.html
CAESAR: http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406674

A few caveats to these datasets. First, and if you believe the media, humans are getting larger and larger. Third caveat: they're all Americans. EDIT: No they're not -- Italians and Dutch folks too.

Feel free to spout these numbers, enjoy!

EDIT: Just to be clear -- only the first dataset is military women. The second dataset was performed by the military, The Netherlands, and Italy (Robinette et al. 1999, Robinette 2000).""

As fate would have it, and it seems like **bras shouldn't cost $30-$50** for the ""statistically common"" varieties and way $60+ for the uncommon ones.

If my research is correct

So I have a potential partner in crime who will be touring factories in China in about two months (for his business in educational robotics) and is going to try to make time to stop by a bra factory and get the details on the latest and greatest. In the meanwhile

1. Bras colors rotate in and out with seasons. Is it important that a bra be ""in season"" colors or will anything do so long as it is ""cute?""
1. We're worried that the lace bits and the robot might not get along because [reasons]. How important are lace bits? 
1. Do you have plain bras to wear under your normal day clothes or around the house in the evening or are these just retired fancy bras?
1. If you could choose
1. Are you comfortable enough knowing your size and knowing that the size are consistent to order online? If the bra was MTM would this change anything?

Thanks for helping us make better bras for you!

**tl;dr: I love bras and make robots. I want to make bras with robots. Give me data please.**

Edit: woah! We're super overwhelmed with the response! Your questions made more questions!

1. Heard lots of hate on foam. What are some examples of folks ""doing it wrong?"" Are you saying high-end bras are cloth only? That doesn't seem to be what internet says.
1. ~~How do you ladies know when things are going in and out of season and when the sales are?~~ *Oh

I'm 16 years old and sort of have a problem with my mother. I live alone with my mom who has really strong opinions about my body and isn't very open minded about trying new things. Ever since I ""got boobs"" (even if they weren't very large) she has been very adamant about the sizes I could wear. Ever since I was thirteen she has forever believed that my bra size is 34A and that it could never be anything different than that or ever change. When she gave me bras they always felt really tight and hurt and basically squished my boobs into oblivion onto my chest. Also, so I just stuck with it. 

So a few days ago I asked my mother if we could maybe go shopping so I could try on different sizes because of how uncomfortable the ones she gave me were. She sort of then reluctantly agreed to take me some time to Sears (Canada). When she agreed

EDIT: So TIL that being an F or G cup doesn't necessarily mean you have boobs hanging down to your waist. I expected everyone to see my breasts and be like, I've never met anyone who looks like me, so it's also a relief to enter into a community of women who are not judging me even though I'm different. I have always wanted breast surgery and had plans for that once I am at a healthy weight again but maybe I won't feel like I need if if the right bra really can improve my shape!

Gallery of my breasts and two diff bras:
 http://imgur.com/a/DzxIM

Backstory: I have gained a lot of weight recently but have always worn an A and AA cup until recently when my band size got so big they no longer made A cups so I went down in my band and wore Bs. I've always had trouble with gaping cups even in A cups.

I had my first baby 6 months ago. Before baby I weighed 235 and wore a 38 B. I don't remember my underbust but I know my overbust was only 40. After baby I always wore ""Ahh Bra"" type bras because I was breastfeeding and they made it easy. However I think they pushed a lot of fat down onto my ribs because I have weird fatty deposits on my upper ribs that were not there immediately post partum. I was diagnosed with IGT and was not able to successfully breastfeed but mixed fed until diagnosis in January. Shallow breasts like mine are common indicators of IGT. 

My boobs seem to be changing all the time. I mostly don't wear a bra as I am home all the time with baby now and none of mine are comfortable anymore. My left breast is at least a full size larger now but my right one did not change much. You'll see that in the photos.

There are 2 bras in the gallery; my favorite bra from pre-baby size 38B and my only real bra post baby size 40B. 

The 38B bra cuts into my skin. It feels too small. But I love how my cleavage looks in it and how there's no gaping when I lean forward. If I could find a bra that fit better in the armpits but looked like this one in the cleavage I'd be thrilled. I don't ever wear this bra anymore btw

I hate the 40B bra. It is slightly padded. It looks great in the cleavage when I do the initial scoop but as soon as I move around the cups gape again. They badly gape when I lean forward. The straps slip off my shoulders if I don't cross them in the back. The underwire digs painfully into my armpits. 

I can't find bras in my size in stores so I unfortunately always order online. I moved to a rural part of Australia recently and the only store that sells bras is Target Country and they really don't have much selection. I don't understand Aussie sizing either.

Here's the thing; it's clear to me when looking at my breasts that they are not an H. I can't even properly fill the 40B bra I have. I need help. :( Thank you for any insight!

If you get measured again (which you should because your rib cage will expand) get one cup bigger than what you size at or measure when your breast are at your fullest. When you nurse you breast size will fluctuate 6 to 8 times a day. Buying a slightly large cup give you room for when your breast get full. Also

You will have to buy a whole new set of bras when your child is between six to eight months old. At six months your rib cage has most likely set back to its original size and the introduction of food to you baby's diet will slow down the nursing. At this stage your breast may even go back to their original size. Though

You will want at least one underwire with clips, like dinner. The soft bra with clips is great for in the beginning or just for casual everyday wear. It's still built to support, but it's comfy enough to sleep in. The no clip cross breast style is great for sleeping in/night nursing or when working out. Also, you don't have to fuss with getting the clip back on while have asleep. 


I hope that this is helpful to a woman or two when this time comes into her life and that you won't feel as lost as I was.

Well, she wanted a bra that was better than her 38DDs that were shredding and literally falling apart at the seams (I hand washed them for her last time and was shocked when I noticed all the elastic banding coming out). So out she walked with a clearance bra that fit her better than what she had been wearing for 40+ years.

I posted on /r/abrathatfits about the Wacoal and how it fit her. /u/t_maia popped into my thread that night and gave me amazing advice and answered all of my questions wonderfully. That night

It arrived shortly after Christmas. She excitedly unpacked it, and asked me to judge the fit.

It was perfect. 

She was beyond gleeful. She just kept staring at the bra and how well it fit her

I *highly* encourage you to browse through it.  Here's an explanation of the different tabs and some ways on how to utilize this data:

1. **by user, many bras that fell into a grey area, and I did my best to assign each one to the yes/no binary, depending on the user's comments.

2. **by bra**: This is a chart of simple totals from the first spreadsheet.  Each bra has been counted individually; a positive number indicates how many people fit into the bra

3. **by brand**: This chart groups all of the bras together by brand.  Note: I did not count daughter companies to be the same as the parent (for example, but have one bra that works fantastically for people with shallow breasts (for example, b.tempt'd).

4. **by style**: Here I have sorted through each bra and assigned a bra style/shape to each one.  I have five categories: demis (which includes most half cups), plunges, and strapless bras.  I have tried my best to assign what I feel is the most appropriate style to each bra, and I apologize if there's some bad style choices in there.  Which style I assigned to a bra came from definitions on [Busty Resources](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), tags on [Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com/), what the bra actually looks like, and (to a much lesser extent) what the manufacturer deemed the bra to be.

5. **by padding type**: Similar to Tab 4, lightly lined, lined/padded, moulded, and pushup.  If a bra was a pushup bra, that was the category I assigned it to.  Beyond that, a lot of these were a bit subjective, reviews

6. **bras: brand, totals**: This is just a compilation of all the data from tabs 2-5 into one chart.  Feel free to take that information and do your own data analysis on it.  Note: what I specifically did *not* analyze was the correlation (if any) between recommended bras and the bra size.  If someone felt like doing that legwork, I'm sure it would be highly appreciated by everyone in this community.

______

And now for some actual results!  These conclusions are *solely* based upon the data in the Google Spreadsheet

**Which individual bras are recommended:**

* b.tempt'd Ciao Bella
* Lepel Fiore Padded Plunge (note: this bra may not work any longer

So what am I looking for?  Anything and everything!  Some examples:

* How did you realize that you had shallow breasts? (I am especially interested in the answer to this question if you have a bra size that's generally considered to be outside the usual shallow breast range.)

* When you're bra shopping

* What bras do you love?

* What bras do you hate?

* Which brands work well for you

* How do you prefer the cups of your bra: unlined

* Tell me about how you deviate (if at all) from any general guidelines for shallow breasts

* What have been your experiences with professional fitters?  Have your shallow breasts stumped/confused fitters?

* How do your underbust measurements (both snug and break-the-tape) compare to the band size you find that works best?  Do you have much ""padding"" on your ribs?

* Point me towards any other blog posts/websites that have helped you in your journey.

* State any questions you would love to have answered.

Feel free to answer any, and put it in one logical, comprehensive guide.  If it's something you'd tell to someone else who has shallow breasts, I want to know it.  Thank you!

I'd saved the best for last of course, figuring it would be apparent how awful the fit would be and then I could try on my size, she was the expert after all. She insisted the 30D was my size, adjusted the straps so the obvious quadboob and spillage wasn't awful and declared it a perfect fit. She insisted my breast tissue outside the cup was supposed to be there. I pointed out the  much larger bra I was wearing wasn't gapping. When I mentioned the issues I had with smaller bras she said I was choosing the wrong style. She lead me to the 30Ds and instructed me to choose some. At that point I left. I have been sized incorrectly, sometimes on purpose, but I have never been treated so dismissively. Even Victoria Secret put me in a better fitting cup, and it's a lot cheaper then $108.

My email:
&gt;I'd like to note that your recommended method for sizing oneself for bras is severely outdated and sort of wrong. The add 4 or 5 inches does not lead to a well fitting bra and is one of the things that leads to the vast majority of women wearing far too large of band sizes and far too small of cups.

&gt;Example: In your video

&gt;In other examples, with a below chest measurement of about 33 and a bust measurement between 39 and 40, depending on time of day. It's what I was sized into based on in person trying of bras. For some reason the 38B your sizing would suggest seems unlikely (or even if I double added because my number difference reflects that my band would still be smaller than the bust still makes me feel a 38D is about as unlikely).

I wasn't fitted by an employee but my sister was. The ladies working there were definitely proper fitters

Unfortunately that's where the good ends. As soon as I got into my dressing room I noticed how jacked up all the prices were. I do a lot of looking around online for bras in places like figleaves, etc., so I have a pretty good idea of what certain bras usually cost. For example, Zoe and Co. was selling the Curvy Kate smoothie bra for $90. This bra usually costs $65 to $70 everywhere I've seen it. Zoe and Co. does not have a sale rack either, and they do not typically run sales, so if you go there be prepared to spend a lot. (Disclaimer: Not trying to say they have no right to increase their prices, just warning people who don't have a lot of money.)

And now for the horrible customer service. While the girl helping out my sister seemed nice enough, but it gets worse. She asked me where I usually buy my bras, and I told her that I've only bought them online which was hit or miss for me, and then I explained that I drove an hour and a half to get to Zoe and Co. so I could try on bras in person. She immediately accused me of coming into the store with no intention to actually buy bras, just to try them on. She then proceeded to lecture me about how their fitting room was for paying customers only, not for people just wanted to try bras and then buy them online. 

At this point I was very angry because I came into that store with every intention to buy a bra or two, I did not intend to just use their fitting room and then buy all the bras online, etc. She didn't apologize, only said ""I didn't mean to call you out."" Call me out on what, something that I'm not even planning to do? So rude.

I had to break out and tell people who might actually care! This is going to get overly long


Some background: like most people, but I could make do for the price and convenience. Then I got pregnant... and my ladies blew up like water balloons. It only got worse with nursing. My band size got up to 44ish while pregnant, and afterward my milk came in and I settled in around a 40H (this by poor-fitting Motherhood Maternity nursing bra standards). Regardless of true/proper sizing standards, suffice to say my girls got HUGE overnight.


Fast-forward two years, I'm broke, and I badly need new bras. For a very long time I've been stuck limping along in my old VS bras, despite poor fit, age, and the fact they are literally coming apart in my hands as I put them on. I finally sucked it up, saved some money


Three weeks ago I had the worst, gave me some spiel about improving the angle of the bottom of my breast, and only grudgingly let me try on a 34DD. It involved being manhandled by a stranger who didn't know her ass from her face. Needless to say, I left angry and empty-handed. 


This past Saturday, and I drove 90 MILES to the nearest Nordstrom (Woodfield Mall, Schaumberg, IL) so we could try on ""real"" bras. I got two more awful fittings there... both tried putting me in 34DDs. One told me, ""Your ribcage measures 31. You have to add 3, so your size is a 34."" I rolled my eyes said, ""Don't bother bringing any


Then I met Henrietta. She's AWESOME. Locals - go see her. Seriously. I tied on about 50 bras on my own before she finally came to check on us. I had tried on every 32DDD/32E in the store and was getting super frustrated. I felt like I was ""this close"" to getting it right. She listens to my story about the bad fittings, you're a 30.""


Eureka! Turns out, and since each brand runs differently...etc. The Cleo 30s wouldn't even reach all the way around. Fantasie closes but is too tight. Freya is just right. I suspect I might find a few 32F/32FF that are equally just right, but that will be a trip for another day. 


I seriously could have hugged Henrietta. Instead


In the end


I'M SO HAPPY I COULD HUG EVERYONE!!!

1353456995.0,13je8d,Considering ordering from Ewa Michalak and don't know where to even start? Here's my experience...,JoanOfSarcasm,54,7,32,"Hello

**BACKGROUND**

To give all the new subscribers a bit of background, and frankly, I didn't realize my bra didn't fit.

Right before MyWifesBusty's post made the front page

Then MWB's post made the front page. My first measurement put me in a 32F. My mind was blown

When it came in, scooping and swooping. I stood up and to my amazement, the band sat flat on my chest and my boobs were sitting in the cups, rather than being mashed into them. 

However, so I went with a 30E. I kept my first 30E bra -- a Freya Jolie -- and figured it fit, but when I looked down, I could see the breast tissue kind of poking out of the top on my largest side (meaning the lace cup was ""cutting"" into my breast tissue at the top, indicative of a too-small cup). I reluctantly tried a 30FF Curvy Kate and 30F Freya. Amusingly, the 30FF CK fit better, but I still was experiencing issues with my breast tissue at the top of the cups. Even worse

This is about when I began researching wide and narrow wires

I determined I needed narrow wires, is nearly 1 cup size larger than my right). I also really liked the lift that the Ewa Michalak styles seemed to provide and really wanted to try the brand that so many women boasted about.

**PLANNING THE ORDER**

I had a couple things to consider. First, but if I go down a cup size further, it's too small -- go figure). 

A lovely lady on Bratabase suggested the half-cup styles from Ewa Michalak over the plunge styles due to all of this

Once I figured out what I had to choose from

**--ABBREVIATIONS**

* The blogger [Curvy Wordy](http://www.curvywordy.com/2011/12/understanding-different-ewa-michalak.html) has a fabulous general guide to most of the available styles of Ewa bras. This is the go-to to get most people started with Ewa bras.
* If your breasts are shallow (tissue spread over a larger area, you may want to try HP bras. These bras have more of a minimizing effect, pressing the tissue down into the chest and lifting it. Some women also have issues with the HP bras ""gapping"" on the sides.
* If your breasts are more ""deep, from what I know. This means you have more tissue at the bottom. Round shaped breasts seem to do very well with these cuts. The higher gore will also give you support and stability.
* Plunge styles have a lower gore
* If you don't have bottom-heavy boobs and find you are fuller on top
* If you want a true, try the HM styles. Most find they run generous in the cups though.

**--SIZING**

* When sizing for an Ewa bra, a 30F). Now, figure out your band size in Ewa sizing. For me, this is a 65 band. *Keep in mind that you do NOT want to go smaller, in my experience, for 32 and below bands. They run very tight. In fact, my 65F measures in at 23"" unstretched (new) and 29"" stretched. It will be tighter than most of your Freya/Curvy Kate bras.* Because of this, don't try a 28"" (60) band. Go with a 65 or potentially even a 70 and keep the band size
* Now that you have your band size
* Ewa measures breast tissue volume like MWB's guide -- leaning over. So take your leaned-over measurement and convert it to centimeters. If you have pendulous breasts
* Now take that measurement and find it along the band size. For example

**ORDERING**

With my size in mind as well as the styles

Ordering was fairly painless, I believe it does prompt you at check-out whether you want to pay now or later. You have 14 days to complete payment.

As soon as I paid

The bra was shipped well and all the paperwork was stapled together so it wasn't a disaster to keep in case of return. I tried on both bras with the padding and found that the 30F fit me best. 

Returning was a bit confusing -- you have 10 days from your receive date to return the bras. I contacted their CS and they sent me the PDF file for the return sheet. I filled it out

Within roughly 2 weeks time, within roughly 8 days. 

Overall, and the construction is top-notch in my opinion. Even without the padding on my bad side, the gapping isn't too accentuated, and I will just take the oomph out of my other bra and put it into the Mak. I also might buy a small extender to wear with my Ewa bras for the first few weeks wear, since they are very tight. However, I do not want to go up a band size (though I probably could) since they do stretch out a bit and fit me even better after that.

Hope that helps someone considering buying an Ewa bra! If you have any questions,False,,t5_2s8kf,1355512278.0,,,t3_13je8d

http://imgur.com/a/CnRSe

What I suspected is turning out to be correct. Ladies with H+ cups in any band size need tight bands. Many people commenting need their BTT or snug measurement, and without a bra that is firm, will not be supported.

It also became apparent that the recent strap issue that was highlighted to Ewa Michalak is common across the board with these sizes. Companies are not grading their patterns down, women in this size range need supertight bands! If not we'd be uncomfortable

Breasts also tended to be narrow and full on top with a lot of projection in this size range. This isn't surprising, so boobs at the other end of the spectrum would make sense to be narrow and to be projected. There seems to be a massive tendency to be full on top, which I've also suspected is common in this size range.

The employees were very friendly and sweet. When they saw we were looking at the bras, the same employee stopped me as I was getting another armload of bras to try.

She had seen some of the rejected sizes we put on the return rack, and really, should be in an I/J probably rather than a G/H. She looked absolutely shocked. She said, ""no, honey. You just aren't that big,"" and then offered again to size me. I asked how they measure for sizing, and she showed me on herself. Around the underbust, then subtract. I told her that's basically what I did

Later, when the employee turned around, I was aghast at the sheer amount of bulging that was going on under her own sweater. Seriously, this woman was wearing a *radically* ill-fitting bra. Anyway, I'm not one to judge and I'm not particularly angry over my experience or anything, but there really should be a class on this stuff that lingerie store employees must take before offering sizing services to the general public. I mean how has this situation NOT been remedied yet? That's basically half of the population walking around uncomfortable because we're so embarrassed about our breasts that we can't even talk about this stuff, or learn it in health class along with periods and puberty or something?

It was uncomfortable to have a store employee stop me to ask about my [mom's] bra size. I know she was trying to be helpful. She's probably frustrated that she couldn't help us get into the ""correct"" size. But honestly, I just wanted to get all this off my chest (harharhar) to some people who would understand.

I'd like to help her but it's very touchy subject.

Some background...   We're both big people, but when I squeeze them there's a lot more there than she likes to believe.

After reading all the stuff from sidebar

* Underbust = 42""
* Tight Underbust = 41.5""   (Barely different...if I would put hardly any pressure on the tape she'd complain it was too tight.)
* Standing Bust = 43""    (Immediately she says
* Leaning Bust = 44.5""   (This might be slightly low

So from those numbers, but she shot me down and got agitated and ""A cups are A cups no matter the band"".  So this is going to be a long road...

Her current bras are like 36 or 38 band...either A or B cups.  She uses the band extenders (often 2 or even 3) to make them actually fit around her.   She acts like bigger bands don't even exist.  All the straps on all her bras are completely meaningless.   Even set as tight as they can go

I'm not sure how to proceed.  She's never even been for a bra fitting in her life (we're in our 30s), but I also don't want her to think I've gone insane. =)   Thoughts, comments, and suggestions are welcomed...

It's not unusual that women get the advice to start out with a bandsize smaller than their supertight measurement

I've seen many fit checks where the wires are clearly distorted, larger further down and getting thinner further up, a band riding up can be a sign of a too tight band as well. 

New subscribers often write that they tried a bra in the bandsize they were recommended and that it was extremely uncomfortable

Even very thin women

First of all I think there needs to be awareness of this, so when someone with a flair says something about the band tightness, they are taken seriously (I've seen people downvoted for suggesting to try a looser band).

After I calmed down I ordered a bra (Freya.) When I told my mother she said G cups were ""pornstar sized"" and that it was ""crazy"" which made me really nervous all over again. Add to that the fact I tried to discuss it with a friend of mine at work and she told me that sounded ""way off"" and she ""used to work for Victoria's Secret"" and that I was most likely a 36C... I was a wreck all over again.

So yesterday, and 32DDD (which is as big as cup sizes go there.) I put on the 32D and I could have cried. The 32 band size felt so right that even without putting the cups all the way up I felt better. I could tell right away though that the cups were too small. And I was right. I spilled out of them even without scooping. After I did that, my nipples wouldn't even fit! I tried on the 32DD with only slightly better results. Next, a 32DDD which I had to have an employee help me hunt down. No dice.

Long story short, if not spot-on.

Even though my mother still thinks ""that makes no sense"" I highly recommend anyone worried about whether their new E/F/G/etc size will dwarf them go and do this. They probably won't have your size but trying on some DD and DDD (which I was convinced would be HUGE) and seeing just how small they are on you will do you a world of good! Now instead of being apprehensive about my bra I'm super excited for it to get here and see how it fits!

The last bra in the second order was also a Comfort Choice 48G. It was so pretty. Notes say cup too big on top

Sent them all back.

Third order, all 48F (One 48DDD)

I had great hopes for the Bali minimizer

Then 3 Glamorise bras (48F) all underwire. Two of them I could get on but it was not easy. Even with a 48 band I had to wiggle them around a half-inch at a time. The straps were problematic to pull up

I sent the 2 Glamorise bras back with the Bali
The catalog name for it is ""Wonderwire Alluring Underwire Bra"". Also a 48F. It's the closest thing I have found so far
It looks so good though. I have been so jealous of the cute balconette styles I see so many pictures of on this site. It was

I would like a bra that is not pointy

&gt;I have very shallow

&gt;While not perfect, though, I think it looks good enough to keep.

&gt;The bra seems simultaneously cheap and well-constructed. It seems well-constructed in that there's a few little details I don't normally see on bras in my size range. There's actual boning in the wings on this bra, in that the inside of the cups is just...foam. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I would definitely agree that sweating will probably be an issue with this bra.

&gt;I do like that this bra is nude and is light on the frills: I like my strapless bras to be practical

&gt;My rib cage fluctuates between 28"" and 29""

[And now for pictures](http://imgur.com/a/gw0xg)!  I have included pics of just the bra

Anyways, nothing will ever fit perfectly.  In fact, I am kicking around the idea of converting one of my existing strapped bras into a strapless.  But until I work up the courage, I think that the Toffi will do.

1366925250.0,1d3z9t,[Guide] A Maternity/Nursing Bra That Fits!,marcelinevampyrqueen,41,3,25,"**Pregnancy**  
You don’t have to wear a maternity bra during your pregnancy. If there aren’t any made in your size, just buy regular bras or nursing bras. This should probably be obvious, but isn’t, because advertising people are really good at their jobs. You do not need to wear wireless bras throughout pregnancy. The problems many pregnancy books mention are caused by the fact that too many women wear wired bras in the wrong size. If the cups are too small or too narrow, the wires will sit on breast tissue, which can be highly uncomfortable for pregnant women and interfere with milk production. Please measure yourself according to [the sources in the sidebar]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) if you haven't already. 

If you do buy unwired bras, but one that tends to work more often than not. So the bras you buy during pregnancy do not need to be cheap throwaway bras. 

Read reviews to see if the bras score high on comfort, but not for everybody. Quite a lot of women grow in the second and the third trimester too. 

Bras that you buy during the first two trimesters of pregnancy should fit you ok on the tightest or middle hook. (This is opposite of the regular fitting advice to buy bras that fit ok on the widest hook.) As your ribcage expands you can switch to the wider hooks or use extenders. Many good nursing bras come with more than two or three columns of hooks for this purpose; four to six is common. As long as you need only a wider band

Some sources will recommend stretchy bras that will allow for some fluctuation in size. [Crop top bras from companies like Medela]( http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Comfort-Nursing-Bra/dp/B0008MFDEI) are popular for this. But many women with larger cup sizes find them unsupportive; the stretchy fabric allows too much room for the sensitive breast tissue to move which can be highly uncomfortable.  

During the very last stages of pregnancy many women find underwire bras uncomfortable

If you are seeking to order nursing bras one or two weeks before your due date, so 32GG/H UK should do the trick.  

**The First 6 Weeks Postpartum**  
Most books recommended not wearing bras with underwire until your milk supply has fully regulated. I disagree. The reason given in the books is the wires interfere with milk ducts

I only brought a sleep bra to the hospital with me. Newborns want to nurse all the time. They are still learning, my daughter nursed 20 minutes on, 20 off for 10 straight hours. It’s not worth fiddling with a bra while you are waiting to produce milk instead of colostrum. Engorgement, however, is another story. Soon after your milk comes in, you will find that your boobs are massive and rock hard. They will seriously weigh more than you thought they ever could. 

If you are larger than average, most frequently caused by blocked ducts) three times in the first two months of my baby’s life. Mastitis feels like the flu, only worse, because your breasts hurt and you have a screaming baby to take care of. Wearing underwires that are too narrow is a near guarantee that you will get mastitis. Err on the side of caution here. The wires need to be well clear of your breast tissue. You will also want a bra that is either very open on top or has stretchy lace to accommodate for sudden change in size. Wearing a too-small bra is also very likely to result in mastitis; bras that reshape your breasts against its natural shape and bend the milk ducts can have the same effect. (Ewa Michalak nursing bras are notorious for this, which is why they are not recommended for mothers who are not at least 6 months post-partum.)

The first couple months of breastfeeding

**Three months to six months**  
At this point, which is also fine! But your breasts are finally getting to where they will stay for a while. You can now measure yourself again using the resources in the sidebar. If you find you are in the 32-40 C-F range, you will probably not have any problems finding nursing bras that fit you, and cute ones at that! If you’re sized out of that, though, you still have options. Any bra can be converted into a nursing bra. If you are on the smaller side, you can generally slide the strap off your shoulder and pull your breast out of the cup to nurse. I do this with both soft cup and padded cup bras with no problem. (I did, tear a Freya Deco

**Six months to a year**  
Remeasure yourself at six months, you may have experienced [tissue remigration](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Migrated_breast_tissue) by now, and could end up sizing down in band and/or up in cup size. As long as you are nursing, measuring every three months is a good idea, but from this point on your size will probably stay about the same.

**One year to weaned**  
First, then two, then maybe only at night. Keep remeasuring yourself every three months or as needed. Nurse as long as you and your child want to, keeping in mind that left to their own devices, children usually wean completely between 2 and 7 years of age and it is perfectly healthy to keep going as long as you want. Once your child is completely weaned, it can take up to a year to completely dry up. You will likely return to your pre-pregnancy size, give or take a cup size (even if you are shaped a little differently now).

Today, 28F (too small in the cups, excruciatingly painful band and underwire jammed into my ribs), and a 32F (cups too big). I made a gamble and ordered 2 Decos in a 30E since Nordstrom is having an Anni sale and the Deco is $39 USD compared to $60 USD. If they fit, I would have two fitting bras in the basic colours. If not, I could send them back.

I apprehensively put on the bra. Band was good -- tight but not suffocating like the 28 (I am 29""-29.5"" underbust) -- and the cups seemed to be a good fit. All of my breast tissue filled the cups after a bit of a scoop, and they didn't quadboob. And holy shit the cleavage. 

The moment was amazing. I finally found a bra that fit snugly and lifted me without leaving tons of extra room in the cups or quadboobing. I felt like my boobs were lifted to my chin rather than sitting in my socks

1374075147.0,1ihoh8,[size check] I have almost no breast tissue but really pointy nipples. Where do I even start?,SerenityF3,42,4,25,"Hi abrathatfits

Due in part to orthopedic bracing through my developing years I have a very small amount of breast tissue

Every time I've tried a bra with any kind of padding (including training bras) I wind up with a cavernous empty space that collapses unnaturally whenever I bump into something. Every time I try a bra without padding I might as well not be wearing one because my nipples are on display for all to see.

I've worked with two half-solutions over time. The only comfortable thing I've found is camis with built in shelf bras. My nipples still show but I just wear a loose-fitting decorative tank over top and it covers them up. When I wear t-shirts I'm forced to resort to these terrible, but the 34 size flops around loosely so I just wear the 32.

The measurement guide says I'm a 26D (???) but I find that really hard to believe. If a 32 band digs how would I fit in a 26? And I understand cup size is relative but really... there's nothing to cup.

Here's the measurements so you guys can have a go.

I've been in desperate need of new bras. For the past year or so, after reading some tips on bra fitting from this subreddit, I purchased a 32C bra. It was an improvement, but definitely not perfect. The gore doesn't lie flat and the band is not nearly tight enough, but it's at least a bit more comfortable. Since then, I've been on this subreddit nearly every day. I've read all the links in the sidebar, and like to think I've lurked enough fit checks to know what a bra should look/feel like. When I measured myself, I've sort of given up on buying a bra in that size. I am but a lowly child that relies on her parents for most clothing items

Anyways

We started in JCPenney

Next was Victoria's Secret, and two unpadded (32B and 32C). The push up gave me the most ridiculous amount of spillage I've ever seen in my life. Like, there's cleavage, and then there's the things this bra was doing to my breasts. The 32B was just kind of meh and the wires dug into my chest, which wasn't much of a surprise. 

The best was the unpadded, it snapped right off. 

Meanwhile, too. You there, you with the big boobs! You are a double D! And you, with the even bigger boobs! You are also a double D but with a huge band! Now would you like that in super-duper pushup or a super-duper-ally-ooper pushup?""

Anyways

Next stop was Macy's

Then it was Nordstrom. I like Nordstrom because when they measured me last time they told me straight up it would be hard to find a bra in my ""real"" size. They didn't even try to shove me into an A-cup with a huge band, so damn expensive! I ended up getting a [Betsy Johnson 30C bra](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/betsey-johnson-stocking-stripe-underwire-t-shirt-bra/3118600), which was really comfortable and fit pretty well. I still feel like the band is a little loose, but it's definitely more than tolerable. 

The best part was my mother, timidly asked to be measured. ""Just to see."" The lady asked what size she was wearing, she said a 36D. It was bad. Gaping at the top of the cups, the band riding up the back, saggy looking boobies...

She measured into a 32F. She didn't believe it could be right, it was causing everything to slide around and not fit right. She also explained the cup size (which was by far the most shocking part for my mom) by saying exactly what I'd said earlier, ""When you go down a band size you go up a cup size.""

The sad this is that just a few weeks ago my mom spent all her Christmas money on brand new bras

So thank you guys so much for all that you've taught me! You've broken two generations of bad bra sizing in my family!

I ended up getting the Chantelle C Chic Plunge (30G), Fantasie Ava (30FF), and Panache Sports (30F).

   * **2. Claudette Dessous (38D) -** see above

   * **3. Freya Deco Honey (38D) -** By some strange twist of fate, the band is nice and snug, the wires are perfect, &amp; the cups lay flat with no overspill or gapping. I love it &amp; it's a keeper!

I pointed out that the wire was on my breast tissue, but I am concerned you won't fill up the cups.""  I tried on a bunch of Cs just to see if I am delusional, but when I scooped and swooped I was clearly bigger than that, if only slightly in some styles, and the wires were all all my breast tissue.  I could have been more pushy and insist that she bring me the size I measured myself, but I was so put off and was not ready to pull the trigger on anything today, so I just left.  

My wife had a slightly better experience with her fitter (who was the manager), ""If you're going to do that you need to shake your breasts down in there so that it won't gap at the bottom""), and she also tried to put her in at least a cup size lower than she measured herself to be.

I have been reading (more like devouring) all the side bar information, comparisons, and videos. I'm completely and utterly *amazed*. Not only have I been putting bras on wrong all these years, but I've discovered that things about my body that I thought were just ""fat"" or caused by being overweight are actually bra-related. I've realized that the weird shape of my breasts (which made bra shopping impossible) isn't all that weird and that I can find something that fits. I'm certain I'm needing a specialized size and this weekend (payday!) I'm going to invest in a soft measuring tape and order my first bras in *my* size. For the first time in my life I'm actually EXCITED to shop for bras!  
  
So, thank you. I feel so stupid now for taking this long to figure this stuff out but I'm so grateful for this and for the recommendation. Thanks for all this information, and thanks for the answers to all the questions I know I'm going to be asking in the coming months. I feel like I've figured out this huge mystery of being a woman and the answer *isn't* surgery.

I'll try and keep both up to date.)

Need a bra? Have a bra? is back for another year! Just like last year

But we're running a bit different this year. I received a great donation of bras for this event from [the folks at Joye's intimates.]
(http://stores.ebay.com/Joyes-Intimates-and-More)  They're mostly bras that have little cosmetic flaws, but they're all in great, wearable condition. 

How it works: 
- If you want one of the bras I have listed

- If you have bras you want to give away to a redditor who needs it

- If you don't see a bra in my listing or in anyone else's listing that would work for you

My own rules for my bras: 

- You can't afford a bra. Buying a new bra would cut into your food, or other essential expenses budget, or you just don't have the money at all. It's up to you to decide if you meet the spirit of this requirement, I don't need proof. 

- You have no good (properly fitting

- You live in the US. 

- You have an established reddit account (meaning you don't create a new account today to post the request.) 

- You know your size (ideally this means you've used the sizing guide on the sidebar to figure out your size.) Please also think about the style of bra you're requesting and if it will suit you.  If you're not sure

- If the bra you get doesn't end up fitting you and you decide not to wear it

You MUST send me your name and address and the bra you want. I cannot ship out a package without a name and your full address.

Fast forward to a few months later and I'm popping out of my bra. Not only am I quad-boobing

I go in and suddenly everyone wants to measure me. I told them I knew my measurements, she took the 38G from me and told me that I did not look *that big*. She then held the bra up to my breast and told me not to try that one. I shook that off. I went and tried the bras on, and I found the 38F fit better, but I wasn't feeling the full coverage, so I continued looking. 

I was in the store for about an hour but I didn't really find anything that suited me. At the check-out counter (I bought some adorable shoes instead)

I was wearing their bra for gosh sakes. I know what size it is. 

I found it incredibly rude

After that I went into Torrid, telling me that there was no way I was wearing a 38DDD because it looked like we were the same size. She told me that she wanted to measure me. I told her she was free to do so, but I knew what bra I was wearing, and that my entire breast was not fitting into either of the cups. 

Then the associates tried to get me into a 40DD (which makes no sense since they had just told me that I wasn't a 38DDD

I'm just frustrated. I don't feel like my breasts are giant, I want it to fit.

I love my girlfriend dearly, but her breasts were just kinda sitting in there.

Fast forward a year.  I want to buy my gf something nice for her birthday... maybe something useful.  Thought about a dress, cause having her seek professional help is near to impossible.  Then maybe give her a gift card to get a good bra or two)

Before, then its a win-win.

**My problems**

- She doesn't think her bra fits poorly.  Well I really do disagree... gaping cups and no lift.  Asked her if she got fitted

- Asked her this morning if I can take her to the mall for a fitting.  She says shes afraid of being put into a A cup (currently a 34B).  Told her that a fit is better than a number

**My Questions**

1) How can I convince her to get fitted? - I really don't mind paying for a couple of bras or a fitting...

2) Will there be massive tears if a A cup is involved?  How to mitigate this?

3) Where do you suggest for a fitting?  I read that VS is shitty but Nordstrom is good?  (I am in New Haven

4) Anything else to know?  Or should I keep my head in my own business?

Again, it is very important I get your feedback on the proposed rules.


First, some of them are different, even if they look similar. /u/cleverdistraction has done a lot of hard work and has made our subreddit a lot easier to navigate and use so please give her a round of applause and a lot of thank you's she deserves it! =)

Another big thanks goes out to /u/chromecoat a wonderful fellow that got involved in this subreddit to help his wife and was kind enough to make us the amazingly wonderful [how to measure](http://i.imgur.com/k6P94Bt.png) and breast shape graphics (someone link this to me in the comments so I can edit it in I seem to have lost the link)! 


Thanks also to /u/ankylosaurus_rex for her shallow breast guide and /u/shaytom for her all-in-one guide! =) If you made a big contribution to our subreddit since my last mod post and I forgot to mention it


Alright, I know it sounds stupid!) where you would post all the bras you wish you could buy but can't due to your size, unfortunately life got away from me and I haven't done it the past couple weeks (though /u/t_maia was kind enough to take over one of those weeks and post it for me! thanks a bunch!) I would like to continue with that but I think I may make it a monthly post instead. 


We will however be starting a *new* weekly thread idea next week! A user (forgot your name


Now the big stuff, no other pointless posts that do not really contribute to discussion/knowledge sharing/aren't asking for help (essentially, if you could make the same post in meme or gif format don't post it). I would include things like busty girl problems comics or other similar things like that (it involves bras, likely to be relatable, likely to get lots of upvotes, but not really benefiting our subreddit in any way) as well. If you want to make a post and the comic/meme/gif is relevant please feel free include it but don't expect it to stand up by itself as good content. I was thinking the small questions/comments thread would be an ok place for that but I'm worried it will get over crowded with that kind of thing and that the more important stuff will get looked over. We could perhaps have a separate thread if you feel like this subreddit would be loosing out by getting rid of those things entirely? What are your thoughts?


I am also thinking about including the posts about VS in this new rule but this is a touchier subject so I'm *very* dubious about it. It would not be posts that have legitimate complaints/praises about a specific expirience but rather the general ""I don't like VS""/""I don't like the way VS is treated on this sub"" posts because at this point they are not contributing anything to our subreddit anymore and a lot of people are getting annoyed with them. I don't really want to have to enforce these new rules but it is starting to look like the content of our subreddit is suffering so if enough people want them I will make them official rules. 


Another new rule (this one isn't proposed, the way it goes is if you're causing problems but without the intent of being mean/acting like a pervert expect to get a warning from me, I will tag you showing that you've received a warning so that I can keep track, if you receive 2-3 warnings you will be banned. Normally this is all the action I will take, but in certain rare circumstances where I feel like the post or comment is going to cause a *lot* of problems, I may remove it, though oftentimes I just let it take its course. So please be considerate when you are posting and commenting, don't escalate it.


Additional stuff:

* The Bratabase Breast shapes project still needs our help http://www.bratabase.com/pages/Shapes/submit/

* The Bra Band Project also still needs our help http://www.brabandproject.com/

* If there are any other projects currently going on in the bra fitting community please tell me I'll add them to this list! =)


Please give feedback on the monthly/weekly posts and the proposed rules, there is a ""I don't care"" option for each) and an optional comments box at the end if you feel you have something you want to say that was not addressed by answering the questions. http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XFDZPNB I want this place to be as enjoyable for as many people as I can make it so please contribute. =)

One of the comments from the thread about the TwoX posts got me thinking. /u/ABraForMe (I think!) said

&gt;When I find an interesting subject, maybe even most, don't want to spend time reading up on stuff. They want a simple guide that includes all necessary information, that is easily digestible, and that works on the first try.

And she's so right! I spent weeks reading through pretty much every post, or it just isn't in their nature to do quite so much research. I see plenty of posts where all they say is ""Here are my measurements, what's my size?"" and I'm over here like... did you read the fitting guide? Not that it's a bad thing that they are posting, but maybe we have too much information in too many different places where they feel overwhelmed.

I know that the mods are trying to rearrange the sidebar and make a wiki and what not which I think will be great, with step by step instructions on what measurements to take, how to calculate your size, and frequent issues that I find myself repeating quite a lot (+2 for smaller girls, try on the bra backwards, just a starting point so try on a variety of sizes, etc.).

Now I don't know how much interest there is in this

Unfortunately, I wasn't sure if I should split up the guide into smaller vs. larger band sizes or if it was more accurate to do the different measurements for smaller vs. larger cup sizes. Does that make sense? Like I know that the different ends of the spectrum need different methods, but is the spectrum based more on band size or cup size? Also, I would love some input on what common tidbits you all find yourself sharing with newbies that we can throw in here in addition to what I already have. Maybe even an FAQ at the end? Who knows!

Please let me know if this sounds like it would be helpful and what all you think should be included!

When I saw their [Paige Italian Lace DD+ Balconette Bra](http://www.figleaves.com/us/product/FIG-123101/Midnight-Grace-by-figleaves.com-Paige-Italian-Lace-DD-Balconette-Bra/?size=&amp;colour=Lilac/Purples), it was only about $31, so not a huge risk if I hated it.

Just got the bra today and I thought I'd share some pictures/thoughts for anyone else who might be curious.

Construction: Quality. Most of the bra is made from a mesh, so I won't hold it against them.

Fit: It's perfect for me

Appearance: Very pretty! From the front, not being as tight as the underlying mesh, looks a little wrinkly in some areas. From the side, it kind of looks like the bra doesn't fit and is really pointy, but it's just because the lace isn't lying flat against the cups. This is not visible under a shirt.

I started talking to my friend today and she had been sized before at Nordy's and was in a 34DD (after years in a 36B). She thought this was right. I told her I believe she is closer to a 32F. 

She's in Nordstroms now and trying on bras - 32F in Chantelle fit! Does that mean she'd be something like a 32FF or G in Freya? I know Chantelle sizing is not typical UK. 

Apparently she told the fitter that I had sized her (from a photo) to 32F and she asked if I wanted a job. ha ha! She also mentioned ABTF and the fitter said another lady had come in talking about a forum... it's spreading!!!!

In reality, the wires rest on sideboob, band rides up... it supports nothing and is more like a boob-compressing sling than a bra. The band is stupidly loose, but my boobs are squished to look flatter/wider than they are because the cups are too small. What a shittastic fit.

The Ewa Michalak, for once, is low enough that it doesn't stab or hurt my close-set boobs, yet feels supportive. (What is this sorcery?)

A while ago I shared my frustrations about the lack of racerback/multiway and longline bras in my size (28GG/H). A few weeks ago, or alter it by adding a stiff ribbon to control stretch.

When I received the Ivy, stretched to over 33' - it's unstretched measurement was only slightly smaller than my ribcage. It provided no support, even on the smallest hook.

The 30G Ivy had a 2"" panel on each side made of a non-stretch fabric. By folding it over end-to-end, so I notched the band and sewed that flat (the red stitching).

Once this alteration was complete, the bra straps were positioned a little bit further out than on the average 28GG. Rather than move them closer in, I decided this was the perfect opportunity to test altering it into a racerback configuration. This was also a great success (ignore the wonky way I did up the hooks in the racerback picture - taking a bra on and off quickly for pictures led to some...interesting hook arrangements).

I now own a well-fitted approximation of a racer-backed longline bra in a 28GG. Given this success

I've also decided to make this bra my ground zero for future test alterations. Next, even post alterations. I also want to add a band stiffener of some kind (maybe a thick bias tape? along the bottom flange of the longline, to help control the crumpling and folding that happens.

NOTE:  In the pictures, and then was in such a hurry to photograph my success that I didn't adjust them.  This explains some of the crumpling in the cups (also contributing is the fact that my right boob is smaller and higher set than my left, so there's always some empty space at the bottom of that cup)  I do actually know that my bra belongs a little bit higher.",,False,,t5_2s8kf,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1epsix/alteration_report_i_am_now_the_proud_owner_of_a/

I'd lost my mum when I was 8 so it was left to my dad and female relatives to help me through female 'stuff'. At 13, so although I'm not skinny

I have always hated my abnormal, where your nipple and areola grows outwards but still they had no substance/fullness to them, looked very deflated and certainly never rounded out. My puffy areolas seemed huge in comparison to the rest of me (sadface), and my very tight quad muscles made my spinal posture awkward and my bottom ribs stick out a lot. My bf of 2.5years is the only person/guy I have ever allowed to see me without a bra on, which was a massive feat for me, although I'm still not comfortable with the lights on, and I refuse to walk around (dark or not)

A year ago, around and above, still gave me a 34A but all my 34As just seemed too small and I'd always be poking out of the top. Debenhams human-fitters gave me 34B which I was super happy with, however after a while, I found I would fall out of the cups if I laid on my side and my nips would show out of the cup occasionally. I definitely wasn't a C cup due to my lack of substance, but I still didn't back fit into my old A's.

I was stumped and very disheartened as I put it down to my silly and unusual shape, except mine are less rounded from both the top view and sides. 

I found this subreddit a few weeks ago and have since, newer girl and properly explained my problems and realisations. I tried a 32C which I found gave me crazy quad boob, then a 32D which fitted perfectly! I couldn't quite believe it, and she checked everything and agreed it fitted great. I was so happy to finally have a bra which properly fits, which I don't fall out of when I lay down or hang upside-down!

I know it's not a big jump, they just needed a mental-push in the right direction. I'm still trying to find a good definition for their shape, but for now, I'm am super happy and cannot wait to get back to uni tomorrow after not seeing my other half for 3 weeks and show off my bit of extra confidence :D

I've been reading fitting directions and taking my own measurements, was proving difficult. I'm 24 years old, but my mom is involved in pretty much everything I do, and she pays for most of my stuff (since I'm a full-time college student, living in her house, and I can't find work). 

I'm pretty much the only woman in my family (extended included) with a ""full-figured bust."" The largest cup size on anyone in my family are my aunt's C cups, that I ""just need a bigger band size."" 

I knew it wasn't going to work, and we do free fittings!""

My mom tried to shrug her off ""Oh no, I think I'll take you up on it."" I was hoping that a professional telling my mother that I needed a bigger cup would convince her.

The manager was fantastic. As she measured, how to properly try on bras to make sure they really do fit, etc. 

""What size bra are you wearing now?"" she asked.

 ""42dd

""Well, so we'll try the smaller and you can let me know if you think you'd feel more comfortable or supported in a G. It looks like your left breast might be a smidge bigger, so you're likely to gravitate towards the G. I don't think there's a big enough difference that you'll need a cup filler for the right, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""

I thought my mom's eyes were gonna fall out of her head. She pretty much hovered on the other side of the store for the rest of my time there. The manager checked my bra fit (I wound up with the G) and helped me to pick out doubles in colors that I liked.

I paid for my purchase and had to call my mom from across the store so that she knew I was leaving. She grumbled about ""not being able to believe her daughter had bigger breasts than her"" and I'm pretty sure I heard something about ""shameful"" and something about the manager being a moron.

So my mom seems to think I'm some sort of amoral harlot because I have big boobs, and comfortable with my body than I have for as long as I can remember. ",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,

I told them my size as 34GG or 36G and they insisted I was wrong. They measured my underbust and brought back 36Fs (I was wearing a 36FF what was *obviously* too small in the cup and riding up in the band) and 38DDs and even multiple 40Ds for me to try on. I tried them all on and showed the woman how poorly all the bras fit. The gore wouldn't tack, I ask if she would please just humor me and bring me a 36G or 34GG. She said that I would ""just bend up all the wires"" in a 34GG, as if I was so fat I would bust out of the bra or something. This is *after* she showed me the tape measure, *in the mirror* of a 33 inch underbust (break the tape measure, 35 or 34 snug is more likely to work for me as realistic). Her reasoning for giving me ever larger bands with smaller cups was that the wires were not wide enough. I pointed out that the wires are wider in larger cups and she said ""not really, they are deeper cups."" WHAT?

So she brings me 2 bras in 36G and they are the best fitting things I tried on! She actually looked pissed off about this. My friend was in the next fitting room and heard how the woman was speaking to me and was worried about me. Anyway, just a smidge too closed on the top likely due to the weird pink squiggly stuff at the top of the cup.

I almost bought one of them because I was so desperate but the fitter was so *rude* to me

Should I go with a 36G in the Fantasie Florence? I looked in Bratabase and didn't see the bra entered. Are there other 3 piece balcony bras by Fantasie that are just a smidge more open on the top?

The band was really loose and the cups were way to small (the wires were essentially either a couple inches lower than the root of my breasts or off my skin completely).

I then decided to remeasure myself and found out that my band measures exactly 34 inches and my bust between 42 to 43. I assumed i was measuring to generous and bought a bunch of curvy kate bras in 34FF. When I tried those on I found the band was still to loose and my righty ( the bigger one) was not being contained.

There wasn't a whole lot in my size that I'd measured (30DD) on the floor, so I said no, and she decided to measure me. I told her what size I measured to, she took my underbust measurement, and came to the same conclusion, testing me with a Chantelle 'C Chic' bra (that I ended up buying in red in 30DD). She had me scoop and swoop for every bra, and pointed out all the things that showed the bra fit - the tacking of the gore, and so on. She even brought me a robe (in case I got cold) and a cami (to test how the bras looked under light clothing

Then she brought out bras. SO MANY BRAS.

The bras she brought me varied in size, so I ended up buying four bras, and one pair of panties to match one of them. My purchases:

Chantelle C Chic - Red - 30DD
Natori Feathers - Black - 32D
Chantelle Rive Gauche - Nude/Pink - 32DD
Natori 136001 Contour Underwire - Blue - 32D (with matching boyshorts)

and it came to $302. A bit much, and the fitting was nice, easy, and fun. All the people I interacted with took excellent care of me and were as helpful as they could be, so I figured it was worth spending a little extra in support.

Nordstrom is a great place to go get fit and get new bras, and maybe even in between, too.

This is where you can ask all the small questions you have about bras that aren't big enough to make your own thread about. If you're looking for fit advice or bra recommendations please make your own thread. =)



**I do have an important announcement I'd like to have the community feedback on.** About a week and a half ago

 The current process is that if you live outside of Poland, and the ordering process taking longer than it should. /u/FacepalmNapalm [made a suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1gt6lr/im_trying_to_order_from_comexim_and_cant_get_a/canrxrx) on a thread a while ago to run your email through Google Translate to include an English as well as a Polish Version of your email. She also suggested to write the subject of the email in Polish to ensure it does not get caught in their spam folders.

Here's my idea: We collectively come up with a series of phrases or possibly questions we would include in an email, if any of us decide to order from Comexim, we can simply pull up the wiki and then copy and paste our translated phrases and we can email them hopefully with more ease and get orders. This will probably turn into a larger guide on how to order bras from Poland, but for now, let's get going on Comexim, so those of us who need to order from them can do so after they start taking orders again on the 15th.

Thanks in advance for your feedback ladies!

* Elomi Suzie - Space at the bottom of the cup
* Elomi Abi - Space at the bottom of the cup
* Panache Tango Plunge - Space at the bottom of the cup
* Panache Sports - Little bit of space at the bottoms of the cups, it's super-supportive.
* Cleo Juna - Too shallow in both 32H and 34H, unlike any other bra ever. I wear the 32H around the house on my days off despite epic quad-boobing, because it's more comfy than my other options.
* Cleo Marcie - Tiny bit of space at the bottoms of the cups and loose fabric at the tops. Like Juna, this is my go-to daily bra, because it's mostly supportive and works okay if I pin the excess fabric down to the gore.
* Fantasie Salsa - The underwires distort so easily I couldn't even begin to tell what the cup shape was like. This bra was clearly not engineered for large boobs.
* Cleo Lucy - Space at the bottoms of the cups
* Bravissimo Boudoir Beau - This bra gets the prize for Worst Fit I've Ever Had. It hits all of the issues in my graphic except for the wire being too wide on the sides, this is also the bra that looks best-fitting when I first put it on, which is how I ended up wearing it all day and finding out just how uncomfortable it is for me.

I was going through the 40 bin while I waited for her to finish up and she asked what size I was looking for. I told her ""42E but I'll try on sister sizes!"" and she just stared at me. I asked what she was looking for and she told me a 42 C but she could do 40s sometimes. I just stared at her and asked where she'd been fitted. She said they fit her at Dillards and I kind of chuckled. I told her about ABTF and that I really doubted she was a 42 C and was probably closer to a 38G or so. She didn't believe me and I convinced her to try on a 40G (the closest we could find). Lo and behold it fit her nearly perfectly! She looked amazing after she tried it on.

&gt;First of all, we have made a decision that it should be mandatory to have both sets of pictures to have a better sense of a client's body shape. I guess this is part of our growing process and we are really happy that our clients such as yourself being so considerate regarding this issue.

&gt;We will send out products that fit you, try to give it to someone that has 2 cups smaller than yourself for the best fit possible. 

&gt;The bras that we send out will fit you

&gt;We will also send you a smaller mini vest.

&gt;If you have any other questions

&gt;Thank you so much and we will inform you when we ship out a better size products to you.

&gt;Please dont hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

&gt;Best regards

&gt;Tallia

Needless to say, than have them returned. Granted, I believe they did alter my bra to fit my measurements more exactly before they sent it to me, so this would likely make it harder to resell, but I am still impressed with the ethic. I am also thrilled that they have taken my specific issues and are addressing them.

1360700853.0,18eb1t,My first experience with Elle Macpherson,slidde06801,30,0,8,"I made a post a few weeks ago wondering about Elle Macpherson bras and the feedback I got was mixed but with a heavy leaning towards ""really tight band and tad to small in the cup"". After hearing that I thought I would pass on that brand but I kept gravitating towards those beautifully feminine bras. I said what the heck and ended up buying two to try out. 

So here is what I think:

The first Macpherson bra I received in the mail was the Dentelle in 32G. Woof

[Dentelle](http://imgur.com/a/7y1lO)

* I love the fact that the cup is made entirely of firm lace. None of that stretchy stuff (I'm just not a fan of it). I found that the cup on me is pretty spot on even when I extreme scoop &amp; swoop.
* Lift and support-wise this bra is nothing too special
* The band is not very stretchy at all, I prefer a very tight band compared to others. If you are interested in this bra I would recommend either buying up a band size or investing in some extender hooks! I got mine pretty cheap on eBay.

Dentelle Rating: **B+**

The second Macpherson that I indulged in was the Never forget also in 32G. This bra is so dainty and feminine. 

[Never Forget](http://imgur.com/a/zGzTf) 

The colors are different IRL the Dentelle is very salmony and the Never forget is a bright girly pink.

* The cup has the same no nonsense lace that I love
* The lift is something I might just forget in this bra. That said
* The band runs a tad tight but not nearly as tight as the Dentelle and it only has a 2 hook clasp.

Never Forget Rating: **B-** 

I am very happy with the bras

At this point, which made me happy. As I was leaving the fitting room, I told her about the gapping problem I had with a few of the bras. She suggested that I pull the straps tighter, and I told her that the other girl told me to loosen my straps!

I told her that I usually wear 30DD, but when I told her my size, get this- she said she had NEVER EVEN HEARD OF A 30DD. She looked at me skeptically and asked what size I was wearing now. I told her, 30DD.

So here are the results:

---

**First Question was: How should we decide which members to consider for expert flair?**

The results were as follows:

**Open Application** - Anyone can asked to be considered (88) 44%

**Nomination by Anyone** - Anyone can suggest another member be considered (61) 31%

**Nomination by Experts** - Any member already with an expert flair can suggest another member be considered (40) 20%

**Other** (11) 6%

Some of the ""other"" responses were basically any given combination of the 3 given choices. So

Self nomination as well as nominating others will be allowed. Some ladies might feel too shy to nominate themselves

---

**Second Question was: How should we decide whether a member should receive expert flair?**

The results were as follows:

**Quiz Only** - Members take a quiz for whatever category they want flair in

**Review Only** - Their comment history is reviewed and used to determine what tier they fall in. (41) 21%

**Quiz and Review** - They are given a quiz to determine which tier they fall in

**Other** (6) 3%

There was an overwhelming response to ""Quiz and Review"". We are thinking of making a quiz that will cover the basics of bra fitting to be administered to applicants hoping to enter the first tier, and we simply see it as a little redundant since we will be reviewing comment history anyway. Applicants for all tiers will have their comment history reviewed, the reviewing process will enable the reviewers to sort through the nominee's post history and work with them to develop their knowledge and skills.

---

**Third Question was: If a review system is used

The results were as follows:

**One mod** (11) 6%

**At least 2 mods** (31) 16%

**One expert (may be a mod but does not have to be)** (19) 10%

**A panel of experts (can include one or more mod but does not have to)** (67) 34%

**A panel of experts including at least one mod** (67) 34%

**Other** (5) 3%


We have decided to do a panel of experts, although only the experts that are involved in the decision making and reviewing process of the applications and deciding on the outcome will be allowed to post, and so that we have a place that it won't distract from other content in r/abrathatfits.

I say ‘measured’ because they said that they measured without bras and just by trying on several bras which was very helpful to be hones because i was comparing it to my bra measuring experience in Marks and Spencer’s where they measured me with a tape and said that I was a G and when they obviously saw that I wasn't one they just said go to the website and find bigger sizes.
The bra that I have is a bra I brought off from eBay for £15 because buying a bra for £30 upwards is torture. I tried several bras and the bra that was the most comfortable was this one:

[Candy bliss bra](http://www.bravissimo.com/products/lingerie/sensational-sets/candy-bliss-bra/pink-silver/ln173psv/?criteria=candy+bliss)

The sales assistant especially noted the fact that the material at the bottom of the cup is a stiff material that will hold my breasts. 

I have brought a bra like it off eBay and it ticks a lot of the right boxes. The center of the bra is the nearest to my rib cage than any other bra has ever been. (I don't think that any bra will have a center that will hit my rib cage because I have extra fat near the top of my breasts that prevent bras from doing that) and it holds up my breasts and everything but some of the problems are the fact that the band feels quite tight. I don't know if this is to do with the fact that for the last year I have been wearing sports bras and I am not used to an underwired bra yet. And I have a little bulge of my breasts at the top of the bra but I don't know if it is normal because of the style ( its a balconette and I have pretty much always wear full cups)

My question is should I go up a bra band size to a 38 (the bra that I ordered is 36k)

Or should I go up a cup size because of the small bulging of my boobs at the top of the bra?

And also does the bra look like a good fit?

I recently went on a giant ASOS spree and this dress was delivered. As soon as I put it on I loved it and I couldn't get over how great my boobs looked in it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/17ygdd/help_mepleasensfw/

(a bit lengthy)

First off, not the bras I was buying. I knew bras came in sizes bigger than a DD, but I never imagined myself as such. Well, after a few week's journey, I have finally found that I am a 32G(us sizing) or a 32F(uk sizing)! Wow! 

After my first post

My intention with walking into the store was to not ask any salesperson for help, she scoffed at me and said, ""There's no way you're that big, sweetie"" and promptly threw a measuring tape around my rib cage (as previously stated in my first post, I measure 31.5 inches around my ribs and 38-39 around the bust). I told her that I was wearing a ""minimizing"" sports bra and that the results would be skewed, but she pompously declared me a 36C and shuffled me into a dressing room. This woman brought me around 10 bras in that size and followed me into the dressing room! I told her that 36C wasn't my size and that I needed a 32G, but she wouldn't listen. To get her to shut up, and pointed out how I was falling out of the cups and that the band was climbing up my back, so I left.

But I did not leave defeated!

I knew this woman was horribly wrong, but I wasn't satisfied...I needed more!

So off to Nordstrom's I went! When I walked in, but the fit was so amazing that I didn't care! I also ended up with a Wacoal bra in 32G, that while slightly grandmaish, fit like a dream and made it feel like my breasts weren't even there!

All in all I came home with 3 bras

I was so elated with my success that I wanted to share my story with my mother. Upon telling her my size, maybe a D cup, but just barely"". Even after showing her the bras I just purchased, and her agreeing they fit amazingly, she still didn't believe that I was that size. It's just a number and a letter! It doesn't define who you are or how big your breasts are, it's all about proportion! Gah, but there was no arguing with her. You win some you lose some I guess.

Thank you again for everyone who helped me! And thank you for taking the time to read my update. I just wanted everyone to see that you can succeed in finding a bra that fits, because you will find it!

When I was in Nordstrom's, and while the black Patsy was nice, the sale price wasn't low enough to actually purchase it because it didn't fit what I had originally come in for. The Deco was pretty much perfect, which I expected thanks to having lots of luck with them so far. I still wanted to see what else there was, though, so I asked for help. I asked an assistant for anything they had in the 30 DDD/E/F/FF/G range to try on, trying to ask for a wide range as a lot of what they had was in US or French sizes.  First issue: I was brought almost exclusively 30 DD/E, I was misheard and was handed 32G (slightly too big for the most part, at least

I had some free time still so I wandered the mall a bit, and was told to press the button in the fitting room when I wanted some help. The first girl told me I was wearing the straps too tight on the DD, and that's why I had quadboob... but when she loosened them, they fell right off and I still had quadboob. No go, obviously. The second girl came in, though, and right away she diagnosed some of the problems: cup too small, and cup too closed. The band was actually pretty firm for VS; I could only pull it about 2.5 inches away (although it was as tight as I could make it). Sadly that style didn't go up to a 32DDD- a cupsize up might actually have been close enough to fitting for me to buy it, and she said ""you probably actually need a 30, saying ""I could probably fit my whole arm under your gore!""

Mostly I'm just really excited that I got to take my niece bra shopping and hopefully they are enough closer to her size that her back problems will get better. And

She let me measure her underbust properly against her skin but not her bust so I added an inch to her bust and had her try on a bunch from 30F to 30H. I also told her that when she feels like they are not fitting and that she needs new ones not to let anyone measure her except me.

The purpose of this weekly post is to complain about all those bras you wish you could buy but can't because they don't come in your size

* A picture of the bra
* Name of the company that makes the bra
* If you know it the style name/number of the bra
* The size range that it is made in
* What you like about the bra/why you'd want to buy it
* What size you wear 

In order to make this last as a weekly post and so we don't get burned out on it all at once, please reply ""ME TOO"" and with your size so that way we can give the companies more evidence of people wanting that bra in other sizes =) This is both for those of us that can't find bras big enough and those of us that can't find bras small enough, or even those of you that fall into the ""normal"" range sold in stores but like the style of brands that cater to the sizes outside of that range =)

I was trying to help a friend by guessing her bra size (she was too busy to measure during the Nordstrom sale)

So I started thinking about myself. What bra size should I have been wearing for most of my life? (In the last few years I gained weight.) I specifically remember measuring myself years ago and using the +4 method. The result was 36D. Okay, but I didn't think that my boobs grew that much. But let's think about the raw measurements. In order to get 36D I must have measured 32 underbust and 40 bust. Makes sense, I measure about 40/41 now. But wait, that's 32FF! Okay, that makes sense as a sister size to what I'm wearing now, but why I am getting such different results: 32FF or 32E? 2 sizes different? Is something really broken with the way we deal with sister sizes? No, that can't be right! Sister sizes work!

And then I had the epiphany (in the shower

Each band size consists of 2 inches, but you *go down 4 cup sizes*. You gain back two cup sizes, volume wise, simply by going up in the band. Thus, the +4 method actually results in a size that is 2 cup sizes too small.

Granted, since the majority of women are using the +4 method when they were originally sized, it certainly explains why people so often go up 2+ cup sizes, by volume, when they get resized with our methods.

I have done my best to combine the data from [our previous spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdGNfVWxQcTUyRG1vOTZsSnN6RjJQalE&amp;usp=sharing) with the spreadsheet from the [German community](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao8F9OSh1cxndHVsYkV6dzVjc2steU9MU0dMWEhCZXc&amp;usp=sharing).  You might notice that some greens on their sheet ended up as a No on mine - this is not an error.  They had slightly different definitions for ""fit"" and ""doesn't fit"" than what I do.  Also

Total there's 199 bras and 45 different people.  I'm still clarifying a few things with my German contact


_____
**Some questions:**

**Padding**

I want to make sure the Padding amount is as clear as possible.  Here's what I went with:

* unlined: When laid down on a table
* lightly lined: When laid down on a table, though.  There's a small amount of thickness to the cups, but not much.  Example: Freya's longlines
* lined/padded: When laid down on a table, and you can push them inside-out and they won't usually revert back to their original shape.  Examples: Cleo Juna, most of Ewa Michalak's bras
* moulded: The cups have a well-defined shape.  There's often foam involved.  If you set the bra on a table, and will pop back to its original shape with little-to-no effort.  Examples: Freya Deco Plunge, Cleo Jude
* pushup: There is some sort of padding or bump pad at the base (and sometimes the sides) of the cup

My questions regarding padding:

* Does this make sense to you?
* Do you disagree with any of it?
* Is there a better way to indicate this information?
* Am I flat-out wrong on these descriptions
* Should pushup be in a different category altogether?  Such as a yes/no thing?

**Shape**

Here's my definitions of the different shapes (this is mostly per the Busty Resources Wiki):

* half: In general
* three-quarters: An average amount of coverage.  Most balconettes fall under this category.
* full: Full-coverage bras.  Very little breast tissue shows outside the cups.
* plunge: A bra that is meant to be worn with a plunging neckline.  The gore is very short and sits at the very bottom of the cups.
* strapless: Any bra that can be worn without straps.
* sports: Any bras meant to be worn while working out.  Generally they are made to keep breasts from moving around while exercising.

My questions regarding shape/style:

* Does this make sense to you?
* Do you disagree with any of it?
* Am I flat-out wrong on these descriptions
* I understand that the line between a lot of these shapes is fairly blurry.  Is there any way to help differentiate between these styles?

_____

**Some Requests:**

* I would be incredibly grateful if you could take a look at my padding/style designations and call me out on anything that is ridiculously off.  i.e. I called a bra lined/padded when it's definitely unlined.  If you want to argue across a fuzzy line (ie

* If there's some bras that can be combined (like many of the Cleo bras) into a single entry

* If there's any bra names that are ambiguous, as it comes in both a balcony and a half cup.

* This last one is entirely due to my curiosity.  If you know you have a store/boutique near you that has a Cleo Jude in your size, sometimes works for shallow breasts (as 2 of 3 people in the spreadsheet found it worked for them).

_____

**Last Remarks**

Here's my general guidelines for the spreadsheet:

Fits:  The cup is the right width and depth

Does not fit: The opposite of everything in the Fits category.

Irrelevant: You don't like the shape the bra gives you.  The straps don't adjust long/short enough.  You could use one bandsize smaller (but they don't make it in the bandsize you need)

* If you are currently on the spreadsheet and the above guidelines make you realize a No should be a Yes (or vice versa)

* If you are currently on the spreadsheet and have tried on some new bras since we last communicated

* If you are not on the spreadsheet and wish to be (and have shallow breasts

What if we gathered the collective strength of our subreddit to petition VS to carry a broader range of sizes and to train their sales associates to fit properly? 

Or what if we had a form letter that we could fill out every time we make a purchase in a online or physical store that actually carries our size and then send the letter to VS corporate so they can see how much business they are losing. 

Imagine how many more women in America would get fitted properly if Victoria's Secret joined our cause.

She said she doesn't feel comfortable with me measuring her without a bra, but I told her I'd teach her how to measure herself. I'll measure her band for her, though, and I can probably get a very rough estimate starting point by measuring over a poorly fitting bra and some guesswork.

Another friend was involved in the conversation and basically BEGGED me to measure her, that she's definitely bigger and needs something better. Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity and invited her to come over and I'll measure her! I am rather excited about this, because I feel that she'll really listen when I try to educate all about bras. I am comfortable enough that I don't mind showing her my own bras(as well as the ill-fitting bras I own to point out certain fit issues) as well as showing her how to physically scoop and swoop.

Some things we will be adding: 

* A visual “how to measure” guide. This will also include what a properly fitting bra will look like

* An ""advanced"" fitting guide based off the techniques used at http://busenfreundinnen.net/ (it will require more measurements and knowledge to use, or if for some reason someone finds MWB’s guide doesn’t give an accurate result, and wish to try it out. It will be written by t_maia, who contributes here a lot and has been a fitter at busenfreundinnen for a number of years. The fitters at that site, despite being a community based site like us, have to go through several months of training before being allowed to offer advice so I trust her expertise.

* Info and resources on altering your bras

* I'm hoping to make another post in a little while asking the question ""What was your bra size then and what is it now?"" so that you all can share your stories on how finding your right bra size has made you happier and more comfortable, they're always inspiring and nice to read =) But be sure to add your stories to the mod post as well when it shows up just so we can have all the stories in one place in the sidebar. If you want to include before and after pictures too that would be awesome, but not at all necessary if you don't feel comfortable with it. You can also just post before and after in your shirt too, it proves the point just as well and you aren't exposing as much skin. =)

* A welcome to /r/ABraThatFits! message and explanation of what this subreddit does and why it is important

So

And on another note, which she didn’t deserve no matter who said what or what the intention was. There are no new rules or anything, you can still post links here to comments like that in other subreddits but please consider that if there is already one person recommending that they should visit r/abrathatfits or that their fitting method is wrong or they are wearing the wrong size, it is probably not necessary for 5 more people to come and say the same thing and that it may be more helpful to reply with “yeah, that subreddit really helped me, by bras are so comfortable now” or “what she says is true because of blah blah blah” etc. so that it doesn’t unintentionally become confrontational if the person starts feeling as if they are being berated by us. We don’t want to make others feel bad about the way they fit bras or how their bras fit them, to make them feel guilty or self-conscious because they did not know what you know, and I'm sure everything will turn out fine. =)

Unfortunately this is a *weird* bra. The cup is very shallow at the bottom

The [La Parisienne Pushup Underwire Bra](http://btemptd.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/underwire/b-tempt-d-la-parisienne-push-up-underwire-bra_958157.html?index=15&amp;searchCategoryId=10021&amp;totalResults=17&amp;displayMarkdownsOnly=false) has removable cookies doing the pushup, this might be a good fit. It's quite open on the top, has a single vertical seam, and has that nice straight-across halfcup shape that works well for shallow breasts. The shape seems more rounded than the Ciao Bella, and the pushup pads are definitely aiming for cakes-on-a-plate cleavage. The gore is a bit wider than I'd prefer.

The [Full Bloom Underwire](http://btemptd.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/underwire/b-tempt-d-full-bloom-underwire-bra_951133.html?index=12&amp;searchCategoryId=10021&amp;totalResults=17&amp;displayMarkdownsOnly=false) is a stretch lace balconette. The cups aren't seamed, it probably wouldn't offer sufficient support to larger or softer breasts (but since it's only offered up to 36DDD I do not foresee that being a big issue). However, if you have smaller, shallower breasts and are looking for a decent unpadded bra, this would be a good one to attempt. Also it was super comfy.

Stupid bump right between my boobs!,sweetquirke,29,4,37,"I don't get to buy bras often because they're so expensive...but about 6 months ago I had enough to buy a few and get rid of the old ones. I knew I had gotten bigger so I was desperate. I was so happy buying these bras and they fit perfectly in the store..

...but alas it was short lived. It's so embarrassing sitting down and knowing that there is a bump showing between my boobs through my shirt. When I sit down (sometimes even when I'm standing too) my boobs push the gore forward...and because I'm short

The only way I get cleavage is by buying a bra that's too small! The only cleavage I get from a bra that supposedly fits is a damn bump.

Ok I'm a very big girl...Over 300 lbs. I'm 28 and my boobs are completely natural. Also they are full on top according to [this post](http://brasihate.blogspot.se/2013/02/clarifying-breast-shape-full-on-top-vs.html). Here are the measurements from the visual fitting guide:

1. Underbust loose: 49""
2. Underbust tight: 44""
3. Upright: 59""
4. Leaning: 60""
5. Laying down: 56""

The bra that I bought multiples of in different colours was the **Elomi 42J US ""Caitlyn""**.

What's strange to me is that the 42 feels so comfy. I always end up with that band size. When I get a fitting done by professionals...they always bring me 46K or 48K... The problem is that those are loose on me and the cup size is so big it overtakes my entire chest to the point where the gore is almost at my neck! ...Or at least it seems that way.

The problem, and I have room for a bit more than that, but it still feels incredibly tight.  The straps also seem to dig into my shoulders, even when they feel pretty loose.  After wearing this bra around the house for a couple hours, I was sore enough that I couldn't wait to take it off.  Is this something that I'll just get used to as I grow more accustomed to a properly fitted bra?  Or does it mean that this size doesn't actually fit?

Edit:  For those of you asking, though there wasn't much difference).  I tried on all the bras again, and the 28B just fits like a fairytale.  I have a really shallow/wide root, which I think accounts for the smaller cup size.  I'm only slightly worried that I should be planning ahead for tissue migration.  Do you ladies plan ahead for these things, or just buy lots of different sizes of bras until all the tissue has migrated to the right place?

Okay here we go.

1. Rotation. It is very important to rotate your bras. The band of a bra (and sometimes the cups!) contain a large amount of elastic. If you wear it everyday, two for the wash. And if she is active.. a sports bra of course. The more often you rotate your bra, the longer it will last. 

To that end

2. Hand washing. This is the most important thing. Even in a lingerie bag, and the underwire gets jostled around like crazy. IF YOU MUST machine wash, I personally recommend the bra ball.  But again, that much agitation isn't really great for bras.

What I use, because wool will felt if you agitate it, and rinsing is a pain.

The one I use is [soak](http://www.soakwash.com/) which is really great. All I do is fill my sink with cold water

Eucelan also works quit nicely! Alternatively

Even if you machine wash, because if you hang it by the straps they will stretch out so much faster.

The more often you wash your bras, but it's generally okay to wear it 2-3 times before you wash it, provided that you are rotating it and giving it time to rest of course. 

3. Storage!  Storage really isn't a huge deal unless you wear the moulded cup tshirt style bras. In which case you want to store them sunny side up as much as possible and avoid flipping the cups into one another. I find it easiest to hang those kinds of bras up in my closest instead of putting them in a drawer

Anyway, including sports, so this is a long time.)

So I've been subbed to this community for over 7 months now. When I first started lurking here it really opened my eyes and for Christmas my boyfriend took me for a professional fitting and for the first time in my life (I'm 23)

Fast forward 3 months, despite constantly measuring myself. Finally found some reprieve with the Elomi Asia in 38G, but the gore didn't tack (was about an inch off of my sternum). So I ordered the same bra but solid color in a 38GG but had gapping at the bottom of the cup.

I also ordered a bra from Braologie in this timeframe that very much DID NOT FIT and was a really long and drawn out process. I don't think it was for me. 

So here I am. Almost 8 months into the process and starting all over again. I'm very frustrated. Most of the bras I've tried on have really skinny bands (only 2 or 3 rows) that aren't good for plus size women like me because I have tissue around my ribcage that's fat

I measured myself again today and got a half inch less than before.  Underbust 27.5

Super disappointed with the Freya... I was really thinking it would work since the measurements on bratabase seemed to match bras that fit me.

The middle wasn't flat against my chest. She said that was normal - my rib bones were just pushing it out

I had breast tissue in the bra... and everywhere else.  Under my arms

Here are my main questions:

What do the numbers mean, or is it the band? What does B, D, H, J, etc mean?

In the bra fitting guide

When I wear my bras right now, or normal?

Where do I buy bras? Right now, at least the ones I get. We went to a Nova or Nora bra shop once, but that was years ago. Also, don't know if this is the right subreddit, but how do I bring up wanting to shop at Victoria's Secret thing? I don't own a single thong, and I'd like one. It's not because anyone is gonna see that stuff, I just want to for me, that sort of thing. And I want to TRY it

I haven't bought bras in at least a year. Should I be replacing these things often? I don't even know if my boobs grow. They sure as hell look the same. 

When I raise my arms, raises up too, like off my boob. Is this normal? Other times, when I'm sitting down, it feels too tight, and I have to wiggle it. 

What is a gore

Sometimes, right? Or small?

Alas... No longer excited when I opened the package. This must be the most poorly constructed bikini of all time! The sizing in the cups seems totally arbitrary(and really, and the cups literally end on my back due to how the band is constructed. The 'band' is about 2.5"" on either side of the cups that stretches very little to attach in the back. It seems like they took a larger size bikini/bra/whatever and just cut the band until it stretched to 28"" without really taking into account how this changed the whole construction of the garment.

Unfortunately, but then the band is about 6"" from being able to join in the back. I was considering just sewing black bathing suit material to fill in that 6"", but this seems like a rather messy way to save a very terrible garment. If it looks terrible with alterations, I'll just want to wear a shirt over it... and in that case, I have plenty of bikini tops or one piece bathing suits that technically work but I'd wear a shirt over just to prevent ""accidents"" because they aren't supportive enough to wrangle the boobs in.

I don't want to sound like a brat, and I wouldn't be as distressed over this if my bras were not causing me so much breast pain and if I didn't have breast tissue migrating. My breasts also sometimes slip around in my bras, and occasionally the band will just unhook itself so that's a very bad moment when just sitting in the middle of class.

She said ""there's no way you're that big! You need to stay out of those sizes. You need to be wearing a C!"" Sigh. I'd been wearing VS 38Cs for a good portion of my life, with breast tissue spilling all over the place, but I humored her and tried some on. Obviously I was spilling out of the sides and the top of the cup was cutting across my upper breast tissue. So she thought it had to be a style problem, same issue.

Finally, I don't know everything about bras, so I thought I'd just take her advice and see how it went.) So she said she'd measure me. I was still wearing a 38C at this point, which was obviously smashing a lot of my tissue in. ""With a bra on?"" I asked, and she said that's how they do it. ok......So she got 37 under bust, and then she measured above and pulled it kind of tight and said ""See, 41! So you're a 38C!"" Sigh.

So then after a few more of that size didn't work, but I pointed out my armpit fat was spilling out, and it was still cutting me across the top of my chest. Also, the band was riding up. I mentioned that, and she said that's how it's supposed to fit! 

The last one she brought was a back-smoothing style. It fit the best, and it wasn't a horrible experience, but I just felt like a crazy person. I mean, if you're spilling out of a bra, why not go up a cup size, even if you couldn't possibly imagine being a bigger size? As I was leaving, she told me some other stores to try, and that I should stay with DD.
