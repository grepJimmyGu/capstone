I think we all realize the chances of us winning the election at this point are fairly slim...

HOWEVER, blah, blah, Libertarians shouldn't be taking federal funding"". Perhaps not, but this isn't a anarcho-capitalist purity contest, this is about spreading a message and giving Americans a viable third choice that actually wants to reduce the state and its influence on our lives.

**Anyway

* Make sure you give out any and all campaign materials you have. If you have the money/time to order more materials and give them out, but make sure bumper stickers and yard signs are not just sitting around on election day. Put them to good use.

* Go door to door and talk to your neighbors and/or hand out materials. Yes

* Make phone calls. If you have a neighborhood directory

* Make sure you go to the polls on election day. This sounds obvious, be sure to go to your polling place and hand out fliers and talk to voters as they walk in. If you have lots of resources already or can purchase them now, put out as many yard signs at your polling place as you can (laws here vary state to state, usually you can do this if you pick them up afterwards).

* If you are able to

The Ohio campaign is running a 5 star campaign (I was working on it this summer as well before I moved down to VA), they have already purchased media and radio advertisements, and they have purchased billboards and a robocall campaign. Polling in OH has been as high as 10%, and is regularly around 4-5%. 

Thanks guys and keep up the good work!

- He's not a cook libertarian

Other ways to put it:

""Most people I meet want the government out of their wallet and out of their bedroom.""

""I want a government that is fiscally responsible and neighbors who are personally responsible.""  

""I trust the American people to make the right decision when it comes to morality or personal choice

Friends
 
Wow.  2012 has been quite a year, economic freedom and smaller government to the nation’s dialogue.
 
We accomplished much
 
None of that would have happened without you
 
As we gather with family and celebrate according to our respective traditions
 
My family and I are doing something a little out of the ordinary:  We are in South America heading out for what we hope will be a successful climb of Aconcogua, and it is amazing to have my family joining me for such a great experience.
 
At the same time
 
Making America better is the goal we all share, taking our message to the media, and otherwise building on the great foundation we have built.  I look forward to having your continued support in all those important efforts.
 
Enjoy the Holidays

Why is it that your views poll well with Americans but it doesn't translate to votes? Why is it, even if your views are exactly the same whichever party you're in?

You are playing a rigged game and you will never win. Imagine a baseball league

There is a silver bullet to kill the government duopoly. It has existed outside of America for a long time, ""Instant Run-Off Voting"". It means that people rank all candidates by preference, instead of picking just one. If their first preference doesn't win, and no one has won a majority yet, their vote is transferred to their next preference. 

For example, transfer my vote to Republican"". Or Democrat, or whatever. The point is- you are no longer wasting your vote by voting third party. You will see a massive influx in votes, because, it's not that people don't support your views, it's just that no one wants to waste their vote on a party that cannot win.

I urge you to put aside your Presidential ambitions, Ventura, Napolitano, Schiff, and people from other third party movements around the country were to start this conversation in America, I feel you canmake this a national conversation. The great thing about it is, in my experience, you need only educate them.

Challenge the major parties: ""If Americans were allowed to vote by preference

I think you could win

**Friends
 
2013 is here – and it will be a truly pivotal year for America.
 
When the dust settled after the election a few weeks ago
 
This week President Obama and Congress managed – unbelievably – to “avert” the so-called Fiscal Cliff by **1) increasing taxes
 
We can either shake our heads and complain…or we can do something to dislodge the entrenched system that is taking us over a **REAL fiscal cliff** – not a temporary one concocted and then avoided by the politicians.  And we can either sit back and let the ever-growing government charge ahead with its plans to rob us of more and more of our personal and economic liberties…or we can stand up and say “enough”.
 
Having received more votes than any Libertarian candidate for President in history
 
Seeing what is happening in Washington
 
Those millions of Americans need a voice, and will be taking the message of liberty, small government and greater freedom to college campuses across the nation, to the national news media, and to audiences of every political stripe.  Stay tuned for exciting plans and developments to come!
 
Together, as we go forward.
 
2013 is going to be an exciting, the politicians will be trying to find a way around the nation’s debt limit.  Legislation impacting Internet freedom, civil liberties, privacy and foreign aid will be on Congress’ agenda very quickly. 
 
We plan to be at the table as these decisions are made – and Governor Johnson wants and needs your help.
 
Liberty is too important for us to sit on the sidelines as the politicians destroy it. 
 
Your friendship and support are
 
**Thank you

Ronald Nielson

Senior Advisor

Governor Gary Johnson
 
 
 
**P.S.  We have a lot of activities and efforts planned for the months ahead to spread Governor Johnson’s message. Your contribution at [Gary Johnson 2012](https://donate.garyjohnson2012.com/) will help make them happen!**

ALERT: GARY JOHNSON SUPPORTERS
Volunteers Needed In Philadelphia August 20-24
 
On August 1,000 petition signatures to get Gary Johnson and Judge Gray on the ballot in Pennsylvania. Only 20,601 signatures were required so we qualified for ballot access and as of now Gary Johnson will be on the ballot. However, on August 8, 2012, our petitions were challenged by those we believe are associated with the Republican Party, who fear Gary Johnson will draw votes away from Mitt Romney this November.
 
In the first stage of this challenge, the Court has ordered the Libertarian Party to supply a minimum of 20 individuals each day commencing Monday, August 20, 2012 from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. to check all 26,000 signatures at the Board of Elections to verify whether they are registered voters. If we don’t have those volunteers, we cannot defend this challenge and Gary Johnson will not be on the ballot in Pennsylvania.
 
The Commonwealth Court Order reads (in part) as follows:
 
The review [of more than 26, Philadelphia, PA 19123-4295 and shall be conducted under the supervision of Court personnel with the assistance of City of Philadelphia election employees, with the objective of stipulating to the validity or invalidity of these signatures.  Review of challenged signatures will begin on August 20, 2012, at 8:30 a.m… Each party shall have present 20 individuals…who are capable of performing computer searches utilizing the SURE system.  City of Philadelphia election employees will instruct these individuals on how to conduct searches on the SURE system.  The signature review will continue between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday until further order of the Court…”
 
I call upon all who can make it to Philadelphia the week of August 20-24
 
The Volunteer Coordinator for this effort is Roy Minet.  He can be contacted at 717-898-6142 (any time of the day or night) or at roy.minet@comcast.net.  He will provide you with more details about how to get to the Philadelphia Board of Elections at 520 N. Delaware Avenue and with respect to parking and lodging issues. Please contact anyone else who may be able to help.
 
This is an opportunity for you to obtain valuable political experience while at the same time doing something important to help keep Gary Johnson on the ballot in Pennsylvania.
 
If you have any general questions about the current ballot access crisis or about the Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania

1346464684.0,z612r,How much does it cost to buy all of Reddit's ad space for a day?,CuilRunnings,76,18,49,"And can we raise that amount for GJ?
     
Relevant from Reddit:
     
&gt;There are two types of links

&gt;When you submit an ""untargeted"" ad, we take everyone with a link running on that day and figure out what the total contribution is of all of those bids. This total becomes the cost for that day of selling out our ad space. Each user gets impressions that commensurate with the fraction of the total that they contributed (so, say, you paid $20 and the total for the day is $200, you will get 10% of the site traffic). In this way, everyone pays the same CPM, though that CPM is variable from one day to the next.

&gt;When you submit a ""targeted"" link

&gt;1) Top spot on the subreddit being targeted. If there is more than one person (or more than one link) targeted to that subreddit on the same day

&gt;2) When a user who subscribes to that targeted reddit comes to the front page, if the subreddit you are targeting gets 1/5 as much traffic as the top (default) subreddits, your ad will get a 5x boost when presented to users who subscribe to that subreddit.
      
So, /r/AskReddit, /r/obama, and /r/romney /r/guns /r/frugal, /r/technology etc + a chuck going towards ""unspecified.""  The totals seem low enough that whatever we happen to raise on a given date, it will be enough to have serious impressions.  We might co-ordinate this with another AMA from Gary Johnson, specifically so he can answer tough questions to make Obama look like a typical politician.  It'll probably be big enough to get lots of coverage from HuffPo

No Libertarian candidate--even Ron Paul in '88--has ever attained more than 1 million votes.  This is the historical record.

Back when he was a Republican

So I propose this:  **Johnson's campaign should begin by making a legitimate effort to win in New Mexico.**  Since he has already won the state of New Mexico, as is most likely the case, Johnson waging a strong campaign in this state is a proof-of-concept:  libertarianism can be popular stance to an electorate that is bigger than a municipality.

Even if Johnson can't win the state

In addition to New Mexico, and possibly Maine and Rhode Island.

Why did I pick these states in New England?  These states have a combination of attributes that are conducive to Johnson getting a foothold:  a native culture of liberty (esp. NH)

The bottom line is that we shouldn't spread ourselves too thin.   

That is a recipe for over-promising and under-delivering.  That will only lead to *another* generation of disappointed and demoralized libertarian activists who are burnt out on electoral politics.  Promoting liberty requires just the opposite:  activists who combine passion with perspective; a willingness to serve in government with the determination to do the nitty-gritty to win elections.

Republicans have been saying, it moved Obama's lead from 2.8%, a statistical dead heat, (95% confidence of the true value being between 6.1% ahead to 0.5% *behind*) to 5.6% (95% c.i.: 2.3% ahead to 8.9% ahead).  That means if the Democrats really prefer their man win the oval office back, it's looks like it's in their best interest to make sure Gary is included in Polls and Debates, to widen Obama's lead.

The trick is that while that's the *initial* effect

Most of us already know that there are plenty of Republicans who aren't happy with Romney (I have several in my family), that means that almost half of Democrats (at least in WV) want an option other than Mr Obama, but still don't want a Republican.  Some of them may be unhappy with his social policies (Civil liberties, wars, etc), while others may be concerned about more fiscal matters (blue dog democrats).  These are the people Johnson would pick up, because he can best Obama on both of those fronts.

**tl;dr:** We should play up the ""Johnson's inclusion ensures an Obama victory"" card with Democrats, and win the Presidency.",,False,self,t5_2rxc8,False,votedflair,

Generally
get what we are after.
We need as many people as possible to help with calling especially if they are unable to actually
attend the CNN Protest itself.

The Rolling Call Schedule starts on MONDAY JULY 16th and continues until we win!
The calls should begin as a wave going from the East coast to the West coast producing a
steady stream for at least 12 hrs each day.

CNN CALL NUMBER (404) 827-1500

STAY ON LINE UNTIL YOU CAN TALK TO THE OPERATOR.
ASK TO SPEAK TO WHOMEVER IS IN CHARGE OF POLLING THE PRESIDENTIAL
RACE.
THEN ASK WHOEVER YOU CAN GET ON THE LINE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

""I would like for CNN to include Libertarian Nominee Governor Gary Johnson in their
polling for the general election because he represents my views on many subjects
being one of them. Will you please begin including him in your polling?""

combination with the protest and a twitter bomb

Are you a reluctant Obama voter?  Or a reluctant Romney voter?  Are you voting ""against"" a candidate almost as much as for a candidate?  Are you confused as to why abortion and gay marriage should decide (or be decided by) your views on economic policy?  Do you feel that neither party really represents what's important to you?  Tired of the broken politics of two factions who hate each other?    
    
If you are sick of the two party system
    
**1.  Identify which of the two major candidates you are reluctantly voting for (or which candidate you are voting against).    
2.  Find somebody you trust who ""supports"" the other candidate
3.  Make an agreement that you will BOTH vote third party.       
(Optional step 4)  Both of you agree to go find two OTHER people to make the same deal
    
Since your original votes would have canceled each other out, but now you can vote for something meaningful.    
    
(How much you ""trust"" the other person should probably depend if you live in a swing state or not.  If you live in a narrow swing state, parent, best friend, whatever.  If you live in a landslide state, you should be safe finding strangers on reddit to make a voting pact with.)    
    
No third party candidate is actually going to win this election
    
In the long run, that would be a big help in building a future where we have more choices.  
    
Even if you really love Obama or Romney, and you can still support the idea of having choices.

Now needless to say be it Ron Paul or Gary Johnson winning will be unbelievable difficult and brutal. 
I think if Gary could put the Paul supporters to work with an endorsement from Paul he could have a chance. One thing Paul supporters have in spades is heart and willingness to go the extra mile, then all the way up to state and on the central committee for *****. I would be willing if Ron Paul was not the nominee to do whatever it takes to get Johnson a win in Iowa. I am not alone.
Before any of that it sounds like Johnson needs 15% in some poll to get on debates. If he could get to 15% and got to debate he would stand a real strong chance of getting much bigger poll numbers. Wouldn't be shocked if it doubled almost.

I think Johnsons chances will rely on 2 things.
Ron Paul supporters ( sorry if that sounds cocky or anything but I believe it. )
Boosting poll numbers as fast as possible. (Through grassroots movements. )

Actually Ron Paul sort of appealed to Occupy

Most of us are supporting the principles and ideas that Ron Paul advocates

Where I see many of you (including GJ himself) going wrong is, don't try to look like everyone else.

I'm about 95% positive that Ron Paul will endorse Gary Johnson if his delegate strategy doesn't pan out. Many many of us are already considering Gary Johnson, not a politician, not a person.

For the die hard Ron Paul supporters who plan on writing him in or not voting, but it's counterproductive to the big picture.

Inevitably there are also people who would want to write in Ron Paul just because he's Ron Paul and they are so emotionally vested in him that they feel like they are betraying him by voting for someone else. For these people you will need to show them that they are not betraying Ron Paul and that it's a bigger compliment to vote the way he would

All that said

Perhaps it would serve all of us best if we promoted both Ron Paul and Gary Johnson concurrently. The only hitch would be if Ron Paul did get the nomination,False,self,t5_2rxc8,False,,,t3_s0d7n

I consider myself to be liberal-leaning. I'm a registered Democrat. I support same-sex marriage. I oppose violent intervention abroad. And I believe that the federal government can do certain things more efficiently than the states.

I know that Democrats are the ones who are labeled ""big government"" but growing up in a fairly liberal town, allowing the government to dictate who can marry (and having marriage a government institution in the first place), increasing the defense budget, etc. etc. As a result, it surprises me when I hear that most supporters of Johnson are registered Republicans, because it sounds like he could definitely sway more Obama voters than Romney voters.

As a liberal

* **He's pragmatic.** Regardless of what you believe the role of government should be

* **He's not Ron Paul.** Ron Paul was borderline extremist - both politically and religiously. I admired Paul's respect to the constitution, or his stubborn steadfastness to the gold standard. He was borderline isolationist. Ron Paul is what turned me off to Libertarianism.

* **He's not Barack Obama.** Obama has been anything but Progressive. This guy has deported more undocumented workers than any other president. He's fought pathetically on Guantanamo. And he's done nothing to fix our national debt. (I'm keeping it brief

* **Johnson is pro-gay marriage, pro-drug legalization, against the NDAA and against American imperialism.** These are issues that *should* be bipartisan, but aren't because American media has become excellent at dividing us over trivial issues.

&gt;Hello

&gt;My name is _______. You may not be aware of this

&gt;In spite of being on the ballot in 47 states and litigating in 3

&gt;Not only is excluding candidates that could win the Presidency undemocratic, and posing as a non-profit and not paying taxes is a felony. By advocating for political entities (which is what the CPD does with the exclusion of any participants outside of the major parties), the organization you support is committing a crime.

&gt;Any semblance of lack of bias on the CPD's part is completely eradicated when one notes that the organization is headed by the former head of the RNC and Clinton's former press secretary.

&gt;I urge you to please stop supporting this organization until they do what they're supposed to do: promote democracy and voter choice.

&gt;Thank you

&gt;Thank you very much for your response. As a point of clarification

&gt;Instead, is clearly not fulfilling their mission (which is presumably what your company is supporting) to:

&gt;""...ensure that debates

&gt;Source: http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=about-cpd

&gt;Gary Johnson was a two-term Governor of New Mexico who was one of only a handful of Governors to leave his state with a budget surplus (to the tune of $1B). He has twice the executive experience of Mitt Romney

&gt;Given the goal of the debates is to present voters with all of the candidates that could win the election and to stimulate the flow of ideas and generate positive discussion surrounding solutions to America's problems

&gt;In light of this

Media Strategy

For television ads, use the ad to pique the interest of young voters who are not strongly partisan and sympathize with marijuana legalization as an issue. Clicking on the ad brings these voters to information that is tailored for that demographic and communicates Gary Johnson's credible stances on other issues.

Media Placements

Network and Cable Television: Target local networks in swing states for networks like NBC, and Fox, with a focus on high-viewership primetime television. Supplement with exposure in targeted local cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV, and ESPN.

Digital: Place video across a blend of efficient video ad networks and high-impact video sites like Hulu

1339393560.0,uvr0q,R/politics can't decide who Johnson is definitely going to be taking ALL the votes away from!,Soonerz,33,7,15,"So many responses in the r/politics thread: ""I can't support Johnson because he will take all the votes away from (insert Obama/Romney here)!""

What is the best counter argument to this? It seems to me that he will take votes equally from both sides.
This is an argument we must combat if we are truly going to win some votes.

Here are some gems:

""TL;DR: Waste a vote on Gary Johnson so Obama can get re-elected!""

""Good idea

""Sorry

""More than the debate it self

""guessing the koch brothers would back this idea since he'd probably steal liberal votes and they are trying to buy the election for romney ""

""I don't know if you are a republican agent

All this will do is help Romney. That is ALL.""

""Wouldn't this detract from support we could be lending towards

This would be positive in three ways: it would energize the youth vote, and it would make the political process more interesting. 

""15% should be good. Romney shouldn't have a problem losing that 15%

""VOTE SPLIT ALERT! Liberal third party spoilers increase the chance that the Republican gets elected.""

""Johnson was the Republican governor of New Mexico. He's not exactly ""Liberal.""""

""This sounds remarkably similar to the efforts Republicans made to fund Ralph Nader in 2008 to draw votes away from the Democratic candidate. With Obama and Romney tied neck-to-neck

""Sounds like Romney's Nader: an un-winnable candidate that will take enough votes away from Obama to allow Mitt to win.""

""Ron Paul's followers were just as enthusiastic as Obama's last time around. It would kill Romney to lose them to Johnson.""

The list goes on and on. This seems to be the most popular type of response to the thread.",self,t5_2rxc8,1339394371.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GaryJohnson/comments/uvr0q/rpolitics_cant_decide_who_johnson_is_definitely/

Is it really just because it is in his best personal interest (since he has celiac disease)?  Doesn't this demonstrate that Gary Johnson would be willing to make exceptions for other policies that are in his best interest or affect him personally?

To me it seems foods should be labeled because the consumer wants them labeled and won't buy food unless it is labeled.  Not because the EPA or FDA says they must be labeled.
