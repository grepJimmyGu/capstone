The maker of the Gill Dyslexic font is a redditor



Step 1: Jailbreak your kindle - start here: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004
Step 2: Install the custom fonts hack on your kindle : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004
Step 3: $20 Purchase the Gill Dyslexic font from : http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ 
Step 4: Create a Gill custom font that is kindle ready

the following files need new names (they come from the archive you will receive after purchasing the Gill_Dyslexic Font)


Gill_Dyslexic_Bold.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Bold.ttf

Gill_Dyslexic_Bolditalic.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Bolditalic.ttf

Gill_Dyslexic_Italic.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Italic.ttf

Gill_Dyslexic_Dyslexic.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Regular.ttf

Now place these files into the \linkfonts\fonts folder on your kindle.  You should back up the original files that will be there so that you can replace them if you want to un-mod your font. You will choose to overwrite with these new ones.  The last step is to reboot your kindle after adding the font.  I am not an expert at modifying fonts so I'm not 100% sure that this is the easiest way to do things

One of the things that's really kept me reading every day is the fact that the Kindle indicates just how much time it should take to finish the chapter I am currently reading. I think I used to avoid reading paperbacks for so long because the sheer number of pages could seem so daunting to my subconscious

However, and I was wondering if there was anyway to re-train the Kindle to judge my reading time accurately again.

I did some seraching and apparently this is a common problem. However

You can reset your Kindle's reading time estimates at any time while reading a book. Bring up the menu bar (the one at the top of the screen) and tap the search icon.  In the search field

    ;ReadingTimeReset

This is case sensitive, my reading time estimate was properly re-calibrated.

The reason for this: I never see the book cover, every time you pick a book up or put it down, you look at the cover - you see the title as well as the cover art. With an ebook, you don't see either - they never stick in your mind.

**Play Minesweeper

  * Press Alt

**Use Kindle to view photos (little buggy):**

  * Navigate to your Kindle via your PC or MAC.  Create a folder in the kindle titled 'pictures'  Within this fold

**Search all your books instantly for specific terms/search wikipedia quickly/etc:**

  * Use the 'search' command in the main menu.  Seems like not a tip

**For viewing regular websites (e.g. not mobile versions):**

  *  it often helps to switch the view to landscape mode.  And it very often helps to utilize the 'article mode' via the browser menu. 

**If you have unprotected files that Kindle can't read - or just can't read well (Many PDF's).  You can email [files of these types](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_navbox_recognize_200375630?nodeId=200375630&amp;#recognize) to Amazon

  * &lt;YourAmazonUsername@free.kindle.com&gt;.  They will email the file back to you.  Or
  *  &lt;YourAmazonUsername@kindle.com&gt;.  They will send it to you over over 3G wireless *for a fee*.  Higher fee if you are physically outside the US. 
  *  If you're sending a PDF though - you need to put ""convert"" as the subject line
  * You can send multiple files for conversion in the same email
  * if any of those multiple files are PDFs

**For free ebooks:**

  * Amazon.com has many free (old) books instantaneously available.  When available

  * Torrents can be your friend for some books...if even the file is sometimes in a non-compatible format.  Either send it to Amazon to convert

**To quickly type numbers:**

  * 'Alt' + Q = 1.  Up arrow + W = 2

**One slightly shady tip?**

  * If you register as living outside the US you can only access Wikipedia &amp; The Amazon store in the browser when using 3G (for wifi everything works).  Say I'm an American and I travel to Japan - I get free 3G internet.  If I'm a Japanese living in Japan

  * Go to your account [here](http://i.imgur.com/no8Yo.png), - the Koreans pay much less for data download over cell than Americans, yet they can't access the web with their Kindles...


**Minor things:**

  * Alt-Home opens the Kindle store immediately
  * Pressing menu anytime displays the time/available space on the top of the screen (I'd missed this for quite a while).  
  * Probably best to leave the wireless off when you're not using it.  It cuts into battery life quite a bit, it could help.   Anyone know if it's best for battery life to turn the Kindle on/off several times a day, or just put it in sleep mode?
   * To take a screenshot: Alt-Shift-G It will save to your Kindle. Access it via USB.

**Last note for anyone who hadn't realized it:**

  * For 3G version - You get *free* pervasive wireless internet in over 100 nations.  That means you can check your gmail/respond(slowly), or wherever.  For free.  That's amazing. 

  * If anyone wants to tether their Kindle to their laptop for free 3G internet - don't try to.  Seriously.  Free 3G internet on the Kindle is amazingly generous.  Don't take *that much* advantage of it by multiplying your data usage by 1000x and thus ruining it for the rest of us.  

These were the tips I thought were best/not horribly obvious.  I've already sold two friends on the Kindle

After several hours of frustration

The reason I ended up with a google books ebook is because I have a required reading for class that isn't available on amazon for the kindle. I purchased it on Google books with the assumption that I'd be able to work out a conversion, if frustrating.

Following instructions are given assuming users are on Mac OSX. It shouldn't be too different for windows.

-----

**1)** Purchase the book and download the "".acsm"" file. 

**2)** Download and install [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/). 

**3)** Double click the "".acsm"" file. It should open into Digital Editions.

**4)** Navigate to /Users/[your username]/Documents/Digital Editions in finder. You should see your purchased book with a "".epub"" file extension

**5)** Download and install [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)

(Following instructions are from the tools package creator's [blog](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/ebooks-formats-drm-and-you-%E2%80%94-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/)

**6)** Run calibre. Click Preferences. Click “plugins.” 

**7)** Click on the “Load plugin from File” button

**8)** Navigate to the tools folder unzipped in step 4

**9)** Open the “Calibre_Plugins” folder

**10)** Select one of the zip files in that folder

**13)** Repeat steps 4 to 9 for every zip file in the Calibre_Plugins folder (five at present).

What's going on:

There are plenty of guides out there for converting epub to kindle already. These, the file you download is not the book itself. To read it offline you have to use adobe digital editions. Digital editions quietly accesses the true file and generates an epub, albeit one with DRM. Opening this in Calibre will result in [this](http://i.imgur.com/QH7T3.png) message, unless you install the plugins mentioned above. 

These plugins strip the DRM from the file

**Disclaimer**

    The ebook industry is flawed. Consumers should not have to jump through hoops to read a book on whatever
    device they choose. THAT BEING SAID I am NOT advocating that ebooks being ‘pirated’. The goal of this list
    of instructions is to help people liberate books they have purchased. ""Dedrmed"" ebooks should not be shared
    or uploaded for distribution.

[Here's the link to the book.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TPZ7XO/)

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:


[On whether teachers become attracted to students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k858y/teachers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_fallen_in_love/c2i8xq4)

[On teaching evolution in a rural southern high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/q0ee4/i_aint_even_mad/c3try9d)

[On a time where I tried to hold a lazy kid accountable and failed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62v2)

[The story that led me to quit teaching](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6ags)

People read these posts and encouraged me to write the book.  So I did.  Now it's free if you want to read it.

After searching the web as to what i should do i realized that either i can report to the police or find the owner myself. Amazon's policy does not allow for me to return the kindle via amazon to the owner. I am content with the fact i will never be refunded my money

So if you live in the Cincinnati / West Chester area and you lost your kindle please let me know. The only other clue is that kindle came with a blue M-Edge case with Red ribbons. 

Just PM the registration code and once verified I will send it to you. If there are better ways of doing this please let me know

I know that when you lose your Kindle, as inconsequential as it may have been. Maybe if I saw books being bought, I could look at the purchase history to get some clues as to who was doing it.

I decided to send myself a message in a last ditch attempt to convince whoever had it -- if anyone had it -- to return it to me. This is the message:

                                             
&gt;Hey. I would really appreciate it if you would return my Kindle to me. If you took it and choose to return it

&gt;My phone number is [phone number]. Call me and let me know where I can meet you to retrieve it. 

&gt;This message was sent on July 3rd

Well, there weren't any open wifi access points near the restaurant. He probably had taken it home, messed around with it some, and eventually figured out how to make it connect to the Internet. Once he did this, my message came through and I guess he decided to do the right thing.

I still look at the Kindle sitting on my desk and am pretty much amazed that I actually got it back. Sometimes people will surprise you

I know these things are easy to lose, and don't deregister the damn thing. If I hadn't sent that message, I would have never seen my electric book again.

* Your device is safest (in order): At home, in a side-carry bag, a backpack, in a pocket. However, there is no strong correlation between how many days you bring out your Kindle and how likely it is to break

""Fairfield is a quiet logging town that is slowly fading from memory. When a strange object falls from the sky and crashes down in the woods

Sinister forces spread through Fairfield, finds himself thrust into the leadership of a ragtag group of survivors that includes a juvenile delinquent, an elderly shopkeeper, a young teacher, and his own mother. Together, this unlikely team must battle for not only their survival, but for the future of the human race. As they struggle to free the town, and will have to face a terror from beyond the stars.""

However recently i have noticed a very disturbing trend in E-book prices...They are getting more expensive every day.

For example on Jan 20 2011 i bought ""Game of Thrones"" for $5.00...now just a few months later the  price is $8.99

Another example is ""The Hobbit""..$9.99 while the paperback is $7.99...


My dilemma is this...i feel like im being taken advantage of by publishing companies...here i spent $189 on a device to read books in a nice compact file that is really convenient. However i did give up a few things in the process


Once you buy a Kindle...or any other E-reading device..you become trapped by the ridiculous prices being set forth by publishing companies as of late...

*Note*:  I am sure Calibre can do this but I did not want to go through and find all the options

Follow [these](http://www.ehow.com/how_5993830_edit-metadata-kindle.html) instructions to step 12.  Then, fill in the data, then check the box, and click convert, one at a time.  This could be streamlined with a batch, I bet):

*     113 - ASIN     Paste the ASIN from the Amazon page for the kindle version here
* 501 - cdetype      Paste the letters 'EBOK' here
* 503 - updatedtitle     Paste the title you want  (if you want to change it.)
* 504 - ASIN     Paste the ASIN to this tag as well.

*A Shock to the System (The Chance of a Realtime)*

**Description**
Almost 20 years after the events chronicled in the Shadowfast Supercar Driver Logs, which leaves him virtually deranged for some days afterwards. Once he regains his senses, he realizes he now possesses fresh new memories of strange events which supposedly occurred years before, during his college days. Events that he is certain never took place. And yet now, he recalls them as if they did!

Concerned for his sanity-- as well as baffled by who would want to do this to him and why-- Staute soon realizes his only clues to the mystery may be within the false memories themselves. And so he begins to examine them from the beginning.

What he discovers there turns out to be a mind-boggling adventure of literally historic proportions; mind-bending people and events

1307300249.0,hs9g7,Should I Buy My 9 Year Old Niece A Kindle?,therascalking,46,6,41,"Yesterday I was visiting my parents. My 9 year old niece was also there.

She was telling me about all the books she's been reading. She powered through the ""Diary Of A Wimpy Kid"" series and even started reading Twilight (yeah yeah .. I know .. but at least she's reading.)

When I was growing up my parent's always encouraged me to read. When times were good they'd always buy me books. When times were not so good they'd always drive me to the library.

I want to pass this onto my niece and was thinking of buying her a Kindle. Here's how I'd like to see it work:

I buy my niece a Kindle and link it to my Amazon account. From the Kindle (or through Amazon's site directly) she can add books to a wish list. I am able to see her wish list and buy her books any time I want. The books

Has anyone done something similar? I checked Amazon and they seem to have a large selection of kids books.

My niece is very mature so I am certain she'll respect the Kindle and not break it.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I spoke with my sister yesterday and she's overjoyed about me buying my niece a Kindle. I set up an Amazon account (not associated with a credit card) for my niece to create a wish list. I ordered her Kindle yesterday.

We live less than a minutes drive from each other so when I get the Kindle I will take it over and explain how to use it... though she'll probably figure it out herself.

I mentioned to my sister that there was no real way to lock her Kindle out from buying books on my account. But she said as long as we tell her not to .. she won't. She's a good kid.",self,t5_2qudz,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/hs9g7/should_i_buy_my_9_year_old_niece_a_kindle/

What do you guys think is the reason e-readers refuse to go global? They are cheap and reliable and probably have (or at least had) a huge marked worldwide. Why are Amazon so local and reluctant when competitors like Apple and other device makes have been global since forever?

It was inane.  Firstly - any such studies were likely performed before the existence of eReaders.  Secondly - I (and other bibliophiles, comics, visually based reference, art or illustrated books, magazines etc.  At least not at a pleasing scale and/or accessible price range.

I've encountered a fair amount of freaking out about the death of paper publication.  The logic that ""if you really love books - you don't use an eReader"" floats frequently through discussion. I even felt that way a few years back.

My reasoning is that if you love _reading_ you would be foolish not to consider doing so digitally.  The benefits outweigh the drawbacks in spades.  In a little while - fisher price indestructible eReaders with an 11"" screen will make a child's giant picture book library into an appealing item they can sit on their lap and drop in the baby pool.  Devices will start getting comics and graphics magazines right

At that time

I don't think I've seen a technological transition up close like this before - where people are so completely freaked out by change.  I guess the transition away from vinyl records was like this for some people

I'm unashamedly tossing shelves and shelves worth of books into boxes and putting them into storage.

I decided that there was a slim chance that enlarging the font may make things readable for me.  I don't know the reasoning behind this really; I guess I figured less eye strain could only help.

So I switched it to the third largest font and put it in landscape mode and gave it a shot.

Just think of what could happen if every citizen had access to such a bevy of knowledge. Can the ereader alone do all of this? No, but just like all new technological advancement it is slowly opening new doors. Some will ignore it, some will benefit, but the net outcome will be positive.

1363182043.0,1a7px4,Guide: How to make a folder which sends documents automatically to your kindle. Windows/Mac/Linux.,medaleodeon,31,8,14,"Firstly, I do so. This official method is much easier to set up

If you're using mac, then read on!

**Accounts Needed**

To create this automatic kindle-sending folder

www.dropbox.com : You should really be using this or something like it. It's creates a secure folder which syncs across all your computers automatically. It's a fantastic backup utility. IFTTT will only read your public folders

www.ifttt.com : a crowd-sourced scripting service which connects to hundreds of other internet services. Basically it can connect to your dropbox's public folder

www.gmail.com : My apologies - I thought any email address would do when I first thought about showing people my method

**Instructions**

1) Go to Amazon.com


2)Sign up for IFTTT. Then go to [channels](https://ifttt.com/channels) and activate dropbox and gmail. If you're logged into both of those services already

3) Click [here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/83822), and is available form the same page you added your gmail account to just now. It should look something like ""***********_30@kindle.com""


Scroll down a bit more and click 'use recipe' at the bottom.

4) Click [here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/83823). Do the exact same thing - add your **KINDLE* email address to *to address*

**Use**

You have a dropbox folder now, ""sendtokindle"" and ""sendtokindleconverted"". Files placed in these folders will quickly end up on your kindle. If you ever find it going too slowly, you can login to IFTTT and under 'my recipes' you can click the relevant recipe and click 'check now', but in my experience it is quick enough not to need this.

Heavily skewed toward the younger demographics

[r/ebooks post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/rg61m/hey_rebooks_im_looking_to_start_a_business_around/)

And here are the main topics discussed in the comments:

* There seems to be a lot of hate toward DRM and any sort of rights management
* International availability seems to be another hot topic
* Indie authors being available on *only* Kindle is an annoyance for non-Kindlers
* Many people wish e-books were cheaper
* Time-based valuation of books was a great idea brought up by several people
* E-books costing more than paperbacks gets a lot of hate
* Internationalization of books is a market that is yet to be tapped (I think)
* Well formatted e-books are better for consumption

There was also a fantastic (albeit lengthy) comment on the dangers of lowering the price of e-books

&gt; E-book pricing is a really complicated issue right now. Amazon pricing e-books at $9.99 out of the gate put us in danger of lowering the public's expectations for what a book is worth, and then think $30 for a hardcover book is outrageous. But (at least in Canada), book retailers strong-arm publishers for deep discounts (usually 50-60% off the cover price) and even then do not pay for stock until a customer has made a purchase. So consider that a hardcover book straight from a publisher costs a retailer $15, and they profit the rest of the cover price - not the publishers.

&gt; On the publisher's side of things, $15-$17 for an e-book is an incredibly fair deal. Especially if e-booksellers begin windowing, which is the process of dropping the price over time, or with different formats (ie, a hardcover comes out for $30, after some months of sales they release a trade paperback for $20, if it does well then a mass market edition for $10). This could be done with e-books: offering an enhanced version for slightly more money, and then dropping the price after a number of months.

&gt; My concern is that people shouting about high e-book prices could damage the publishing industry. I think it is important to communicate to consumers what an appropriate price for a product is, it's still a lot more affordable than buying that same book new in hardcover.

&gt; Readers have plenty of options to save money on book buying (buy used, borrowing from friends and libraries), so I can't sympathize with people who say e-book prices are too high. They just aren't.

Thank you everyone for helping me out with the research for my business idea. I think my original mission of ""showing publishers that it is economically beneficial to set lower prices for e-books"" will have to go back to the drawing board. The discussions over the past 24 hours have contributed a few alternative ideas

**UPDATE:**
I was not expecting this much interest
The first order of business would be to select a book for us to start on.
First here are a few sources to find free (legal) books to browse/select from/download

* [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/texts)

+ [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/)

*  [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page)

*  [Many Books](http://manybooks.net/)

*  And of course--[Amazon's selection of free books](http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1292447706/ref=sr_st?page=1&amp;rh=n%3A133140011%2Cn%3A!133141011%2Cn%3A154606011&amp;bbn=133141011&amp;sort=price)

**If you find a book that interests you please post it here!**

Next order of business would be the formatting for the discussion threads--I like [/bookclub's](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/) way of splitting it up for chapters

The next issue I see is using this reddit or the subreddit RarneyBubble created http://www.reddit.com/r/kindlebookclub/.  I would prefer if we were to use the /kindle reddit because it could attract more attention and a few threads a month would not create too much clutter



*Now for my nomination*
[Theodore Roosevelt and His Times](http://www.amazon.com/Theodore-Roosevelt-His-Times-ebook/dp/B002RKRU4U/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1292448662&amp;sr=1-8)
I know nothing about this book


**Oh and as a side** I feel it would be awesome to have a side section for short pieces.  Some of my favorite pieces of media have been short stories such as Harrison Burgeron, Runaround or Guts.  I will work on putting a collection of these together if anyone is interested in this as well.

1333245880.0,rn71n,"Follow-up: Results from the study you participated in with Stephen King's ""Mile 81"".  AMA",swiftsam,29,9,11,"About a month ago

First

**Who participated?**
I posted my announcement for participants on four website for approximately the same 2 day period at the beginning of March.  243 people participated and they found the study through these sites (with # of participants):

* 153 from reddit.com/r/kindle
* 53 from mobileread.com
* 34 from kindleboards.com
* 1 from kfireforum.com

* Geography: 39 US states represented plus 61 participants from outside the US
* Gender: 184 Male
* Age:  Mean = 33.76

**What was the research about?**
My dissertation is about the process of negotiation and how the arguments a negotiator makes may unexpectedly influence his or her attitudes and beliefs.  This builds on work in social psychology on self-inference (or self-perception, then I must be a person who believes in X / feels positively towards X /etc.”  This can result in interesting shifts in a person's attitudes or beliefs if their behavior was influenced by something outside their control.  In a classic study, the experimenter randomly assigned people to give a short speech either in support of or against a certain political position.  Their beliefs afterwards had shifted towards the argument they were assigned to make.   Negotiation is an interesting context because good strategies often require us to make strong arguments in support of things we may not have felt strongly about before.  In order to bargain down the price of a house for example, it would make sense to argue that the neighborhood is going down hill and that you should get a discount accordingly.  My research asks the question:  Do you now feel more negatively about the neighborhood than you would have if you hadn't made that argument?

Feel free to ask me questions here

**How was this study designed to test those ideas?**
In this study, I am interested in the book you have for sale, but I would prefer to pay less … ""  What was different was that half of the participants had the opportunity to support this request with a persuasive argument and were told to “Emphasize why you think the book is not valuable enough to justify the asking price.”

I compared these two groups (I'll call them Argument and No-Argument) on a few different measures.  First

I chose to use e-books for this study because they were engaging enough to be interesting yet cheap enough for me to give away (and because I'm a kindle owner)

**What was the hypothesis?**
My hypothesis in this line of research is that the act of making value-oriented arguments (i.e. “why the book is not valuable enough to justify the asking price”) results in less positive feelings about the value of the product.  This study was designed to test for that difference in people's ratings of the book as well as in their behavior: whether they returned to claim their copy of Mile 81.  I hypothesized that those in the Argument condition would rate the book more negatively and be less likely to claim their copy.

**What were the results?**

*First

* How do you think Mile 81 will compare to Stephen King's other books?  mean = 3.7 (out of 7)
* How boring or entertaining do you think Mile 81 will be?  mean = 4.89 (out of 7)
* How excited will you be if the seller accepts your request and you get to download Mile 81?  mean = 2.42 (out of 5)

* How many people bothered to claim their copy of Mile 81 after the 3 day wait?
* 92 out of 243 (38%) requested their copy of the book
* 74 of the 92 (80% of requesters
* 13 of the 74 had at least started to read the book when I followed up 2 weeks later

*What differences were there between the conditions?*

* Did those in the Argument condition rate the book more negatively than those in the No-Argument condition?  There was no difference!  There were not generally any statistically significant differences between the ratings by the two groups.
* Were those in the Argument condition less likely to request their copy of the book?  Nope

*So what happened?*
This is the fun of science.  You design a test of your hypothesis and see what the data have to say about it.  I have two theories that could explain why the results did not support my hypothesis.  

* A “selection effect”.  More people dropped out of the Argument condition mid-study, that could explain why the Argument folks were more diligent about showing up to collect their book.
* A difference in engagement with the study.  Because the Argument folks spent more time in the study and wrote a paragraph about the book

It's ok though

**And finally
I randomly selected one participant from among those who completed the study and contacted the winner on 3/31.  I will post their username if they consent.  I can say that the winner came to the study from reddit.  If they don't reply to claim their prize in 7 days

**Edit** 
The winner was reddit user CM_Crusader who chose the Kindle Touch.  Congrats!

* iPad/iPod/iPhone/etc. have an Overdrive app. You download books via the browser (not sure how yet) and it goes into the Overdrive app. 
* On ebook readers (Nook
* The local library *is* supported with each ""check out"" of ebooks/audiobooks. The same way that they are supported when you check out a physical book.

**On the Kindle:** The Librarians/Overdrive rep did not know the answer to those questions

My hope is that the Kindle will have an Overdrive app,False,self,t5_2qudz,True,,,t3_j27r6

The touch screen is not as sensitive as the iPad's

-

The 8 hour estimated battery life seems pretty accurate

-

The jury is still out on the Silk browser. When I first started using it, I actually felt that it was going faster than when I started.

-

Conclusion: The Fire is not an iPad, and based on the comparable tablets like the BlackBerry PlayBook ($349) I can't imagine that in the near future there will be anything under $300 that will compete with the Fire. 

For me, to watch videos or do some light web surfing, I think the Fire was a worth-while purchase.

I have Calibre software (version 0.8.50) installed on my PC.

1\. What's the easiest way to clean up title &amp; author info for several books that are listed in ""Kindle For PC""?  

2\. If I create collections in Kindle For PC
    will the collections get synced when I start to use my Kindle Touch?

3\. Can I move just specific books to the Kindle Touch
    Does it transfer them from the PC (so it would get my edited titles)  
    or will I need to go to the Amazon web page and do ""Deliver to [my new Kindle device]?""

4\. Is there any easy way to determine which filenames in the ""My Kindle Content"" directory  
    correspond to which titles
    (I'm thinking of putting the very small files
    or the very large ebooks

5\. Do you have any advice about organizing ebooks into collections?  
     I have a spreadsheet that lists most of my Kindle orders  
     so I'm going to decide on the collection names before I begin.

rsp2k means Reddit Self-Posts 2 Kindle

Hi

This is very early version but I need feedback to know how to develop it into something that will meet eveybody's need.  
I'll be really grateful for every piece of feedback or opinion or request and I PROMISE to answer everyone and implement every good idea : )

**How to test:**

**A)** Unpack.

**B)** First of all you need a file(s) that's a list of url's to reddit posts ([example](https://raw.github.com/HGrzywacz/rsp2k/master/lib/links.txt)). You can either make it by hand or using get_top tool (name is misleading):

    $ python get_top.py kindle 10 new
    $ python get_top.py 60 day askreddit
    $ python get_top.py controversial 321 all worlds_news
will get you 10 newest r/kindle submissions

If you want files to save in directory called 'lists' just create such directory.

**C)** Download kindlegen for you platform from [HERE](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621) into directory with the app.

**D)** Run rsp2k on prepared list

    $ python rsp2k.py askscience_top_20.txt
That should get you a directory called *askscience_top_20* with a *book.mobi* file inside it - ready for putting on your kindle.


**Few important things:**

1. I'm not at all happy with formatting - that's why I need your comments and suggestions.

2. Tested on Python 3.2 - so probably won't work on Python 2.*.

3. If you know html, python - any help will be extremaly appreciated. Just pm/mail me : )  
(even if you don't know any of this subjects but want to help and you speak good english you can help with writing Readme - i'm not a native english speaker : ) )

4. NOT tested on Windows - but theoretically should work. *crosses fingers*

5. If I'm not answering for few hours that's just timezone differences : )

6. Once again: any comment, suggestion will be really appreciated and I promise to answer and consider them all.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,

It really is a nice device and I'm sure I'll get tons of use out of it.  If you like physics based games (Fantastic Contraption, favorites like Angry Birds are easily three times more fun on a screen which is three times the size of my phone's screen.

The device is hefty when compared to a Kindle, but I found that it can be extremely immersive, and its perceived size is much greater when you're using it.  It is only slightly larger (width/height) than my K4, so it fits nicely into the interior pocket of my jacket.

I will say my #1 gripe with the device is the carousel.  Between my K4 and my wife's K3 Keyboard, with all their *colorful cover art* too.  Oh, and whatever page you were last browsing on the internet, that's up there too, whether it was /gw or the front page.  It will really make you think twice before letting anyone touch your Fire.

The device is VERY dependent on having a WiFi connection.  If you don't have a wireless network in your home

Reading on the device is as expected.  It is not an e-ink Kindle

From a technical perspective, but nothing that really inhibited by enjoyment.  Overall, the device is slick and responsive.  The Silk browser works well, and if it really does speed up over time as people utilize it more, it could be great.

&gt;Get ready to walk in front of the mirror



&gt;Look away from the mirror and get your toothbrush and toothpaste. Hold your toothbrush in one hand and the toothpaste in the other. Do not look at the mirror. Instead



&gt;Carefully inspect how you are holding the toothbrush and toothpaste. Ask yourself if this is how you normally hold them. Let them feel strange in your hands.



&gt;Be certain that the toothbrush is your toothbrush

1321727807.0,mi84b,My Fire experience so far (long),dngrCharlie,30,11,37,"I received my Fire on the 16th and have been using it pretty much non-stop (except for work and sleep) since then.  I purchased the Fire because of the price and I wanted something small to surf the web on while watching TV or otherwise indesposed.  I'm already a Kindle owner as well as an Amazon prime and Netflix subscriber so I thought that I might get some use from those services as well.  My wife owns an iPad and I consider myself reasonably tech-savvy.

So far I can say that I've really enjoyed it and it's served its purpose well.  I have spent most of my time surfing the web

**Silk Browser:**

* I like the tabs on the browser and how easy it is to open new pages in new tabs (especially compared to an iPad)

* I don't like the fact that you can't seem to control the next tab viewed after you close one.  If you close the far-right tab

* Saving bookmarks is easy.
* There doesn't seem to be a way to organize bookmarks except by giving them custom names as they are sorted alphabetically.

* In general

**Launchers (Default and 3rd Party):**

* I quickly replaced the default launcher with Go Launcher Ex.

* I wasn't a fan of the carousel (one reason is because it shows EVERYTHING which is just makes a weird mix of stuff)

* Built in launcher wasn't very customizable

* Go Launcher Ex is way better but it takes some work to customize and there are some Font issues (you can't control the size of the Font in the App Drawer which makes it wrap in the middle of words).

* While you can make shortcuts in Go Launcher to Videos, you can't make a shortcut to your books!  So, I still have the default launcher (carousel) as a shortcut in Go Launcher Ex.

* You can't (at least I haven't figured out how) set Internet Bookmarks as launch icons in Go Launcher.  That's the worst thing so far.  I'm guessing that Go Launcher just doesn't know how to access bookmarks in Silk so nothing happens when you try to create a shortcut.

* At some point, with the Fire in mind.

**Browsing Reddit:**

* I tried BaconReader (have to download this directly from the site and enable non-Amazon apps).  In general

* the .compact version of Reddit seems to work very well in Silk and that's what I'm using now.  

**Battery life/General Usability:**

* Since I've been using the device for long periods of time (and, especially compared to my Kindle.  However, I think that will change as I use it fewer hours (i.e. for reading/media as opposed to just experimenting).

* It's a nice size but you do have to re-size web pages a bit in order to get the text a readable size (at least for me!)

* I can hold it with one hand while reading and use my thumb to advance pages so that's nice.

* Not all apps/things rotate when you turn the device around (e.g. Angry Birds).  That is really only a problem when trying to orient the power/headphone jack to a more comfortable side.

* I really enjoy surfing the web or reading while Pandora or Rhapsody is playing in the background.

* I have not missed having a ""Home"" button or that I have to click that ""Settings"" icon to get to volume or brightness or whatever (at least not yet).  They are not that hard to get to.   I can see the need to a Wi-Fi on/off shortcut as I'm guessing that will save battery life if you are not streaming anything.

* While it's portable

**Wishlist (not just Fire wishes but app wishes as well):**

* A way to customize the tabs in Silk more.

* A way to add internet bookmarks into a home page in Go Launcher Ex

* Improved Reddit apps (more of them)

* HBO Go for the fire (I subscribe to that already)



Overall, you wont' be disappointed.

1320584876.0,m2cg3,Not being able to truly share Kindle/e-books is ridiculous,abenyishay,34,17,31,"I'm certain I'm about to oversimplify things

I know it's the publishers' doing, as industry greed becomes more apparent.  

When I buy a book, I should be able to do the same thing with an e-book...not ONCE for 14 days with select books.  Publishers cannot be concerned with losing money were e-books truly shareable because the expectation of physical sharing is already there: if e-books didn't exist, the book would likely be shared at some point anyway.

In fact

* Moving away from physical objects – The number of times a physical book is shipped, warehoused, inventoried is ridiculously high.   
* Book Successes having to pay for Failures – The Internet allows for crowd intelligence
* Book Returns – Every 4 copies of a book that are sold have to pay for the 1 copy that has to be returned (not to mention the returned book’s shipping
* Amount of Manual Labor – There are a TON of people involved in the book creation
* The fact that a book takes 16-18 months after being acquired to get to stores.
