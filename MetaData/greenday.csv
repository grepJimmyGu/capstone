Before they were Green Day, they were briefly known as **Blood Rage**. Well, not exactly -- Mike and Billie were the only constant from one band to the other, as far as I know. 

Anyway, as did another guy by the name of Jean. Jean was one of Mike's bandmates in Blood Rage, and the band decided they needed a logo. I was the artist in my class, so Jean came to me and offered to pay me a whopping $5.00 for a drawing. Hey, it was 1986, I was fifteen years old, and $5.00 sounded okay to me. Jean described what the band wanted

Well, which I threw in a box within a week or so.

Fast forward a bit: Green Day became absolutely huge

Through mutual friends I even collaborated with the band briefly on the design for American Idiot

The band got even more gigantic after American Idiot's release, just sitting in a box: the Blood Rage sticker.

I have never once seen another one of these stickers, and those were probably backyard parties, all of which happened a quarter of a century ago.

Basically

I apologize for the low quality black-and-white photo and the watermark, yellow with red blood. Oh, and I only drew the image here, I didn't select the font or the colors they used. Pretty sure that was Jean...

That being said...Nimrod is their best album

Every single song off of Nimrod has a unique feel to it. For instance; Take Back. Take Back is arguably their most hardcore song ever. And the track right after Take Back is King For A Day

My point is: each song brings something new to the album

But it's not just the fact that each song is unique, I *have* to turn up the volume.

Even with American Idiot, each song is great, and each song sounds slightly different...but there's just something about the way each track off of Nimrod is blended together which is so *perfect.*

Anyway. I just felt like sharing. 'Cause I knew you guys would listen.

They've been called sell-outs for the past 18 years

Does anyone else agree with me on this?

Using Mumford And Sons as an example

""I get they want to be folk rock, you're an outlaw. You don't play by those rules, you're a rock 'n' roll outlaw. It doesn't mean you have to be on drugs,, but when you get onstage you don't play the guitar up here, and it's not an acoustic guitar. You play the guitar down here. It doesn't come from your brain, it comes from your guts. It comes from your groin. It's sexual. It's tribal.""

He finished by saying: ""Finally, there's more for Green Day, more for the bands that really are rock bands. I don't understand why everybody is so afraid to be in a rock band.""

1349806487.0,117gye,[Mod Announcement] New rules for /r/greenday,Slapdown,46,5,17,"Subreddit rules:

1. **Don't harass others** - We're all here for one thing

2. **Use the search bar** - We have 1

3. **Please, but if someone says they don't like a song, it usually gets downvoted which is not how reddit should work. Reddiquette people, don't downvote others because you disagree, downvote if it has nothing to do with the discussion.

4. **Music video and single debut policy** - When a new song comes out everyone will try and be the first to post it. This results in the front page getting cluttered with the same thing. Just giving a heads up that it will be removed if it's been posted already.

5. **No direct links to song or album downloads** - Informing people that the leak is available and where is fine

6. **""Overused memes"" are frowned upon** - I say frowned upon because while it won't be removed

7. **No deleting your comments repeatedly** - Apparently this needs to be on here for it to be in affect. Nobody likes seeing constant threads with ""deleted"" in them. Plus it ends up not adding anything to the discussion because nobody knows what was said.

That's it, we will give you a reason why to be fair to you.

Comments below and mod mail are welcome if you have anything to discuss or add to it. We want to hear what people think. Thanks guys.

As I grieved with her family in the hospital room, we found the strength to play green day songs on a phone and place it next to her ear. I believe she heard it, because her heart rate just so happened to get a little faster. I am telling you this because this little girl was undoubtedly the biggest green day fan in the entire world, and anyone who knew her would agree 100%. Ever since I met her 7 years ago, she raved about her love for you guys. Posters all over her room, tons of green day clothing and Merch, she dealt with cancer. Thankfully she was cured, when she had a terrible seizure in a restaurant

**Song meaning** :

Opinions about the meaning of this song range from a call for revolution (""Where have all the riots gone?"") to the nearing end of the world (""Where will we all go when it's too late?"")

The song begins with a female voice singing the lines that will later recur: ""nobody likes you, nothing is forever. No one wants to fight for their beliefs anymore (""Where have all the riots gone? As your city's motto gets pulverized""). Jesus failed to be a rebel, his life in the city was a sand castle built on lies and pretence - and it fell apart. He didn't want to be Jesus of Suburbia, but he couldn't handle being Jimmy - and now he's neither (""You're not the Jesus of Suburbia. The St. Jimmy is a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love...""). His war with himself led to a crash of his relationship with Whatsername. His fake personality wasn't enough to keep her by his side and she leaves the City and Jesus behind. ""It's not over till you're underground"" ‒ she still has a chance to try and start a new life somewhere else. Which she does.

**Song meaning** :


This song is filled with so much creative profanity that its lyrics are not even printed in the album inlay. (""The lyrics to Platypus will not be on the CD because of lawyer problems due to my potty mouth"" - Armstrong). 

In Platypus the narrator verbally attacks a person that has not only hurt him in the past

The song is said to be directed towards a journalist that Green Day had an unpleasant experience with. Supposedly he wrote good reviews about the band's music before Dookie

What I want to know is why other people on Reddit have these negative feelings pointed at Green Day--it's pretty obvious that they're hated on much more than a lot of other bands.  People claim they sold out, but what?

Also, but the anti-Green Day circle-jerk threads on /r/Music and /r/Punk are very frustrating, blaming the band for something they're not really in control of.  

**EDIT**: Yes, and I understand that.  I was simply asking how we could get a better name for Green Day out there--I think they deserve more than general internet notoriety, even if people do view them as a three-chord pop boy band.

The vast majority of Green Day fans on this subreddit are male, and while there definitely are more males than females, it's much closer to 50/50. 


The average age of Green Day fans on here is about 18.  I'm going to date myself by saying this, but again, we'll get into why in a little bit.


Most GD fans are from US/Canada/North/Central America, followed by Australia (4%) and then Africa and Asia both tied at 1%.  What I was most surprised by here is that there are NO /r/greenday fans from South America! I wonder why that is.  I mean, at the very least, out of that 100, I thought that at least one person would be from Brazil or something, but I guess not.  Strange.


Most of you (41%) don't have a high school degree, I am assuming, you are still in college).  No one on the subreddit has an associates degree, but 8% of you have earned a bachelor's degree.  Finally, 2% are really smart cookies that have earned at least a graduate degree (or doctorate /Ph.D.).


American Idiot was the first record that over half (55%) of you have listened to.  Now, that means that the average fan on this subreddit was 10 years old when AI came out, and they have been listening to Green Day for almost half of their lives!! Wicked!  I wish I could say that about myself, but as AI was the first album I really listened to as well, and I am 25, there is about 17 years of my life where I didn't know Green Day.  For shame, I know. Here is a chart with the rest of the results: http://imgur.com/m7cy4  Can't say I'm surprised that Dookie and American Idiot are the most popular choices

Edit: Fuck Reddit's formatting for numbers and tables.  If a song has a number to the right of it

The average fan has seen Green Day almost 1 time


A small majority of you do not own Green Day: Rock Band: 53.6% to 43.4%.  I'm surprised hat more don't own it


Here is how you guys listen to Green Day: http://imgur.com/uxBOA
Only thing surprising there is that some of you still listen on your cassette tapes! haha

Here are the newly revised rules and some guidelines of r/GreenDay-

**Don’t harass other members**

* r/GreenDay is meant to be a gathering place for redditors to talk about the band and interact with other fans on Reddit. Verbally abusing someone because of a difference in opinion or any other reason is not allowed.
* If you feel like you are being harassed whilst posting in r/GreenDay, and then they are banned from posting to r/GreenDay.

**Utilize the Search Bar** 

* r/GreenDay has grown steadily ever since it was first created more than a year ago. As of this posting, it is possible that your original submission idea has already been done, or your discussion question idea has already been done. Searching will let you know if you have an original thought, or if four other people have beaten you to the punch.
* __**Insanely obvious reposted threads or submissions will be removed.**__

**Favorite and Least Favorite submissions

* These threads can at any time be removed by a moderator


**Collection or merchandise posts must be categorized as: [MERCH]**

* This includes CDs, accessories, tickets, and screenshots of digital collections.
* Posts that are not properly labeled will be removed and the poster allowed to repost their submission with the tag. This follows the same “three infractions rule”

***THE DOWNVOTE BUTTON IS MEANT FOR DISCUSSION THAT IS NOT RELEVANT OR CONSTRUCTIVE TO THE CURRENT CONVERSATION. NOT TO SHOW DISAPPROVAL OR DISAGREEMENT WITH AN OPINION.***

**Image Macros and “Memes” will be removed upon the discretion of the moderators**

* Regardless of the submission’s popularity
* Appeals will not be accepted. Measure of quality is under the discretion of the moderators of r/GreenDay.

**After the first post on a significant piece has been put up

* This includes tour dates, and other news.
* NO. EXCEPTIONS.

**It is encouraged to report rule breaking content**

* Reporting things you see on the sub that break any of these guidelines help contribute to the greater effort of improving the quality of the subreddit. The moderators all have personal lives that require them to be away from their positions a large majority of the time. It helps us out and keeps the crap away!
* Some cool things may await you.

**Posting meaningful

* More info to be added later

**Utilize the “Message the Moderators” link for any concerns or questions**

* We love feedback. If you have any questions about the rules or anything about the subreddit

**Links to pirated or illegally downloaded material will be removed immediately**

* This includes comments or submissions asking for torrents or downloads. We don't want to see links to thepiratebay on the front page.



*Subject to change upon the discretion and approval of the moderators of r/GreenDay

As per recent developments in the community

These were introduced as part of an effort to improve the quality of the subreddit. These will be enforced **STRICTLY** by myself and the other moderators

Please post your thoughts and ideas about the revision of the rules

The song of the week this week is 86 from Insomniac.
 **Song Meaning:** Found [here](http://www.geekstinkbreath.net/greenday/song-meanings/86/)

""""It's kind of about this conversation I had with someone when I went back to Gilman last December [1994], what the fuck are you doing here?'"" - Armstrong.
The term ""86"" in this song is referring to being banned from or thrown out of a place or social circle.
The song was inspired by what happened between Green Day and Gilman Street after the band got big. After the release of Dookie Green Day were rejected by the punk community they had once been a part of because now they were apparently “sell outs”. The lyrics, let alone friendship. 

It’s interesting that the lyrics don’t actually say that that person is wrong. They merely describe what has been said leaving the decision about whether those words are just or not to the listener. However

TL;DR: Some guys at Gilman Street called GD sell outs after Dookie

1367587130.0,1dm81g,[SONG OF THE WEEK] F.O.D (Dookie),potlah,36,8,20,"**Song meaning** :

**Fuck Off and Die**... a song describing a truly horrible feeling that a lot of us have to experience at some point in life. And that would be having to deal with a person you absolutely cannot stand. That often happens with a colleague, communicate with them and pretend that your relationship is fine, while in your dreams you see yourself slowly cutting their head off and enjoying every second of it. And, of course, every once in a while you have major fights - torching the bridge between you, but you still have to see each other every day, so you keep putting those fires out.

But the hatred and irritation keeps ""burning in your guts""

Musically the song consists of 2 parts - the quiet one and the loud one. This basically demonstrates the 2 stages of this hateful relationship - first you deal with that person and keep suppressing your anger

**[Live at Woodstock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSCKykzbNdE)**

well what most people don't know is that this actually happened to an actual person except with an opposite reaction. There was once a young boy who fell into a coma because of a car crash him and his parents were in. The doctors said that his brain patters would be better if they let him enjoy music while in the coma.

My little story:

Back in 09 during the 21st Century tour, my eyes wandered off to a black tour buses window. I saw a guy looking through it, wearing Oakley sunglasses, had brown combed back hair and then I realized it was Tre Cool just 10 feet from me, staring me down. Eventually the bus passed by, and I told my friends... ""Guys... I just saw Tre Cool eyeing me down"" and they went ""Was he in that tour bus with the California licence plate? Damn we didn't look at the windows!"". What I found interesting was that Tre bleached his hair while backstage, so he didn't have brown hair during the actual concert.

At any rate: I picked up Uno the other day. I was skeptical, and immediately I was taken back 15 years. It shares the sounds of Nimrod and Warning, more polished, current, and clearly carrying on some of the sound from American Idiot and 21. I sat and basked in it, just enjoying the sound I've been waiting for year after year. American Idiot was good, but it was a shift in sound. I was ok with that.

My brother picked me up Dos and Tre for Christmas - apparently he had gotten a 3 disc set and wanted to choke me when he found out I bought Uno lol. So I've been listening to those as well.

I have to say...this is Green Day. These albums are quintessential Green Day - absolutely perfect. Any of these songs would be right at home on Nimrod

When 21stCB came around, I genuinely think the only reason I liked it to begin with was my attachment to the older albums. I don't know how many of you are similar to me in how you like your Green Day, but I just wanted to share my opinion. I've started listening to ¡Uno! today, and I quite like it. There are some songs that I think are a bit cheesy, but I can get over it. 

Can you guys share your Green Day story
