I was talking to a friend about how it ends, where King says it's the end... but if you'd like, you can continue reading and see what was in the Tower. My friend protested and said that little ""gimmick"" was bullshit and totally unnecessary, because *of course* we're going to keep reading and see what's in the Tower. Who wouldn't read that whole series and just be able to set the book down without *knowing*?

I started laughing. I had never verbalized before why I loved how he ended it

So as much as we, and curse him for his unfaltering drive, at the end of all things... we climb that Tower with him. King stops us and pulls us out of the story for a moment and makes us *choose* what we want to do. Are we content to walk away? Or do we, like Roland, have to *know*? And all of us, each of us, turned the page and climbed the stairs and completed the cycle. In that moment

I believe his obsession with the tower in the face of all the death and negativity it brings upon him and his loved ones is his damnation. His obsession to see the journey to the end is one and the same as ours. He will be freed from this cycle of pain once he and us as the readers stop at King's warning. Our obsession to read on is what damns Roland. Once we stop, a FINAL, ending. And Roland gets his redemption. That's the way I see it. 

I don't think the horn has much to do with anything other than to show each time he gets closer to realizing what is most important. Friendship

I feel many people just see the warning as King being strange/copping out; failing to recognize the genius and importance behind it. The amount of times we as readers push on to the end is the amount of times Roland continues his damnation. When we all reached that warning for the first time there was no way we could just turn back so close to the end. And that's exactly the way Roland feels. It's a very creative way to mirror Roland's internal struggle in the reader and give us an opportunity to decide when his hell gives way.

If Bilbo won, Gollum was to show him the way out. If Gollum won, he gets to eat Bilbo.  Bilbo won the contest by asking ""stupid"" riddles which Gollum said was unfair, and which he could not possibly know the answer to. 

In The Dark Tower, he was to be able to kill the ka-tet. But, as we know, that didn't happen. I know King said somewhere that the Lord of the Rings stories gave him some inspiration for The Dark Tower, and I think this might have been one of those inspirations.

Yes, you know, when the phone rings or those dream opportunities sort of present themselves, it's really difficult to say no. I think there's a part of all of us — writers or directors or fanboys or whatnot — that, when you went into those worlds, imagined what you would do with it. And when somebody calls you and says, ""I'm going to give you the opportunity to manifest that,"" you just say yes. That's what happened with Dark Tower. Entertainment Weekly brokered this little summit between us — J.J. and I, best pals.

**Sure. Steve-arino.**

Steve. You know, like, nine-hour period with him, the result of which afterward was that J.J. and Stephen started exchanging e-mails, and J.J. ended up optioning The Dark Tower series for 19 bucks — I was like, ""Oh, that's clever, and J.J.'s like, ""Oh my god

Also, amazingly talented filmmakers really struggling with those books. Is it a movie? Is it a TV series? Is it both? How do you work the time-travel elements of it? There's a boy, Jake, in the series, who becomes this pivotal sort of time-traveling lynchpin [throughout the books], and therefore you either have to have a 12-year-old who doesn't age, you know, like, or we have to throw out that entire plot point of Jake.""

**It's the Walt problem on a massive scale.**

Yes. Oh my god. And the pivotal emotional moment in The Gunslinger, and then you revisit that moment like, five times over. Like, I ran into Akiva Goldsman, who was adapting it, and I was like, ""What are you going to do about Jake?"" And he was like, very quickly.

If you are a Dark Tower fan you owe it to yourself to read them. Not only does the comic's story line itself do an absolute ton of fleshing out Roland's past and showing events that he only mentions (Jericho Hill for example) in the book

Robin Furth, writes an end of issue article or story that is basically always some form of world building, or midworld history, or any other insight into the Dark Tower universe you can think of. All the shit that is glanced over or not fleshed out much in the books is thoroughly explored in these articles.

Unfortunately these awesome stories only appear in the single issue comics

Robin Furth has literally explained more backstory and lore about the Dark Tower universe in these end-of-issue stories than SK was able to ever dream of fitting in the saga itself.*

1363636395.0,1ajkiq,"Just finished the books for the first time, a few thoughts... (spoilers ahead, constant reader)",Kiruvi,43,16

Upon reading the last page, and the wheel of ka began yet another cruel, uncaring cycle, I felt a lead weight in the pit of my stomach that I haven't experienced from any other of the hundreds (if not thousands) of books I have read in my life- some certainly technically 'better' or 'more important,' but no book has drawn me to care for a cast of characters as I did for Roland and ka-tet.

I nearly burst into tears in the middle of a coffee shop, the coffee shop's radio began playing Hey Jude.

It took me nearly three years to finish the series after I started in my last year of school, in a way, I wanted the journey to last as long as possible. It took me almost a month to finish the last half of book 7. I am blown away by how much I loved these books- warts, flaws, deus ex machini (machinas?), and all.

It also got me thinking- and I apologize if these topics have been discussed to death- about the meaning of the ending. My first reaction was horror at the sheer, I came to look at it in a different way.

I think that Roland is being the gift to try his journey again until he gets it right, sub-conscious effect- his soul remembers even if his mind does not. Perhaps on an earlier journey, he used Eddie as cannon fodder alone, letting the worthless junkie be killed by the mobsters, or didn't bother drawing Jake a second time to atone for killing him before.

On this particular quest for the Tower, on the next turning of the Wheel, he has the horn- I think his ka-tet with Susannah, Jake, Eddie, and Oy taught Roland to value people, and treasure their memory

So why does Roland need to keep repeating his quest? Because he is doing it so very, he has, as Gan tells him, filled the Dark Tower with death. Roland is the last Eld, and as such has an important metaphysical link to the tower- his life influences what the Tower means and contains. By living a life of violence and bloodshed, being known as a chary man who is doom to all he meets, he fills the Tower with blood and death- and the tower is the center of all reality. Roland is, destroying the world more effectively than the Crimson King ever could.

So, learning a lesson or two each time, until he can change his world view and approach the Tower with life rather than death. Perhaps Roland is wrong to remember the face of his father. Perhaps Roland, like Susannah, must see his gun as a used up relic whose time has passed, and set it aside. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I like to think that the ending contains that (tiny) note of hopeful optimism for our sorrowful Gunslinger.

Another question I came up with- how many times has Roland reached the Dark Tower? It seemed kind of impossible to figure at first

I see two general possibilities

First, somthing intangible and unique to him, which in this case is the possibility of redemption.  Thus he is offered a second (third, fourth, seventeenth, millionth) chance to do the right thing, whatever that is.  The idea of the keyworld and, all of reality is secondary to the needs of he who is in the top room of the tower.

Second, and this is the one and only time that Roland and his ka-tet save the Rose and the Writer.  This would be in keeping somewhat with the idea that THIS cycle, out of all of them, is the one being recorded, the one worth noting.  It's not the one where Roland finds redemption, but it's the one where it becomes a possibility.  Every cycle after this one is another step toward Roland saving himself, which is only a hope after he has saved the keystones of reality.

I had read books I-IV years back and recently decided to go through again. 

I have to say I absolutely love the ending. I thought it was heartbreaking

I thought there was a lot of good things about books V-VII

I thought SK including himself in the book was cheesy. I really think the focus should have stayed more on the importance of the Rose and the Wizard's Glass. Having himself as a character nearly spoiled these books for me.

Speaking of the Glass, and the Crimson King, I thought King just glossed over it. It was really disappointing. I felt that the Crimson King and Flagg should have definitely played more of a role in the ending too.

Some things I really liked were the story of the Wolves

I have read around that King thinks he might re-write books 5-7 and remove himself from the story. I think this would be a fantastic idea. Hopefully he would re-write the deaths of some of the bad guys too. 

I think his best opportunity would be to get this series on HBO a la Game of Thrones. George R. R. Martin helps with that series

The biggest question is how will the horn change things? I'm assuming Eddie would be hauntingly proficient with it.

Can Susan Delgado be saved? We never know if Mid World is unique in being only one instance. An older Roland saving Susan and telling him to forsake the Tower in this existence could be another spot of growth for him.

Is it feasible that any of his Ka-tet can be saved?

- In The Hobbit, if Bilbo won then he'd go free. In Wizard and Glass, Blaine offers a very similar challenge to the group.

- In the Hobbit

- In The Hobbit, Eddie Dean offers jokes as opposed to riddles, and the 'backwards logic' that riddles require made Blaine's circuitry corrupt even more. In fact, earlier in book 3, Roland even became irritated at Eddie for the nonsensical questions/jokes.

I am in no way calling King a plagiarist or anything like that. Just about every single King book is peppered with literary (and cinematic) movie references and comparisons.

Roland crosses the desert heading stubbornly SE. He climbs the giant mountains

I am confused as to how he could have gotten turned around like this.

Also the last ten pages or so of The Gunslinger...I knew I was strapped in for the next six books immediately.


Edit: If you could include a line or two of context that'd be awesome. It's been a while since we've been on the path for a lot of us. 


Edit II: Here's another passage I really enjoyed from The Gunslinger when Roland recognizes the piano player

*""Mejis, eyes wide. The gunslinger nodded, amiably enough now that Sheb was no longer trying to stick a knife in his lights. ""Mejis,"" he said again. ""On the Clean Sea.""*

*""What about it?""*

*""You were there

*""What if I was? I don't remember you.""*

[Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came](http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/rbrowning/bl-rbrown-childe.htm) by Robert Browning

and

[The Waste Land](http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html) by T.S. Eliot

My favorite lines from any poem ever are the following from The Waste Land:

*There is shadow under this red rock
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock)
And I will show you something different from either	 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you	 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;	 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.*

So it took me about 3 months from start to finish - including a 2 week break trying to get through Wizard and Glass.

Though I did enjoy *The Gunslinger*

*The Drawing of the Three* was what really hooked me. I loved the character development, everything. 

*The Waste Lands* was more of that. More drawing me into the story and making me really like the characters

Now, I just couldn't make myself commit to reading it. I powered through it though, and while it's probably last on my list, it did provide valuable insight into why Roland is the way he is. Moving right along.

*Wolves of the Calla* brought me right back to where I wanted to be. Action, more Character Development and **HOLY SHIT** Did I ever love Father Callahan being in it! *'Salem's Lot'* is one of my favourites, so I was happy to see an old friend. My heart continually broke for Jake and the sacrifices he makes and everything he endures throughout this book.

*Song of Susannah* was another one that I wasn't *crazy* about. I didn't like that the Ka-tet was split up. I love John Cullum and the role he inevitably plays in the series. I really didn't like how Stephen King puts himself as a character in the novels at first. But

Now on to *The Dark Tower*. The longest of the 7, heart broken, excited and happy. And again, seeing **Ted Brautigan** was a real treat. I say this a lot about a lot of books but *Hearts in Atlantis* was one of the first SK books I read, and it remains one of my favourites. I loved seeing Sheemie again!

I think we are safe in saying that the Man in Black, he is Nyarlathotep, he is Richard Fanin, Rudin Filaro, and every other RF you can think of. He is the Walking Dude.

But

Is he Marten Broadcloak

Is he John Farson

I would have to say he is not these latter two. For one, while we know Walter is the son of a farmer, and that he left home after being raped as a youth. While this is written by Robin Furth, the comics have been approved as canon by Stephen King, so where does that leave us?

John Farson seems to be a tougher issue to look into. Farson interacts regularly with Marten, and we don't know of Walter having any family...

Here are a few discussions I've been dying to have:

1) How is King still so largely classified as a horror writer? Most of his best works have nothing to do with horror. The Stand, but it's not horror.

2) I also re-read Eyes of the Dragon recently and made an interesting connection. Walter/Flagg talks in Eyes about being *dim* pretty extensively. He says he cannot disappear completely and that magic is impossible, but perhaps not realizing that is what he's doing.

**Edit:** Forgot to mention, but that's when the light bulb clicked on.

Walter has also lived for hundreds of years and seems to have far better than average intuition. Magic

3) Who was Mama Roberts/Kingfish

3a) Who is the 'Green Man.'

4) Who or what do you all think Old Dor truly was? Just a denizen of the tower who liked dipping into the world of the short-timers? 

5) When Ralph makes his compact with the Docs before confronting Ed and the god entity states that 'It may be so' he talks about all these colors he sees

I was daunted to start the series (didn't want to be tied to reading seven books), didn't like the crew apart), and the Dark Tower also took a couple of weeks (though only because of the length).

After looking through the history on this subreddit, and when he finally landed back on the desert and I read that last line, my jaw dropped and I smiled.  I thought it was a perfect ending.  I've read a lot of the thoughts here on the ending and theories, and they're interesting.  I'm of the thought that he's been through this thousands of times, and the cycle will only end when he decides to abandon the quest.

I'm glad I took the time to go outside my comfort zone and read these books.  I haven't read any other Stephen King, and I think the ending just made it that much sweeter.  I'd rank the books the this way:

1. Drawing of the Three
2. Wizard and Glass
3. Wolves of the Calla
4. The Dark Tower
5. The Wastelands
6. The Gunslinger

In the original The Gunslinger, King says he had been doing the trick a thousand years. Then in the revised edition later when he hears Nort speak the high speech Roland thinks it has been centuries or millenniums since the last time he heard the high speech.

The latter example may have been exaggeration, and then read the revised one after book seven.

That is why is is so interesting to see that while in the original edition, then he wakes up with the first patches of gray at 40 and it makes a lot of sense.

The first question that I hope is easy to clear up is about the nature of the Keystone worlds.  In *Song of Susannah*, Jake and Roland are again in the keystone world to Save King in 1999, and later Roland exits the world by going through the Dixie Pig which had apparently been very recently shot up by Jake and Callahan. I was under impression that due to the linear flow of time in the keystone world, you could only enter at *one* specific time. Or did the power of black thirteen somehow circumvent this rule?  If so, it seems like this could have easily led to disastrous consequences.

My second question was about Mordred’s telepathic abilities.  We see he is quite powerful, from their shared ancestry to their inherent “goodness”, but was it ever specifically mentioned why he didn’t at least try to mentally manipulate them, maybe while they were asleep?  Also it seemed like he could have used this ability on Patrick to cause all sorts of problems for Roland.  Was there some reason why Patrick would also be immune?

I can see why it was necessary for Susannah to leave the group before Roland made it to the tower, are gunslingers .  They have the skill and the character to be considered as such.  Although she’s suffered the loss of her love, and the trauma of being joined to Mia and carrying Mordred, it seemed like she gives in way too easily to the possibility of being together again with Eddie and Jake.  She clearly understands that (due to the clothing they are wearing in her dream) although they may be deeply connected in some way, these aren’t the actual people she lost, but rather similar ones from a parallel world.  It almost seems like an insult to the “real” Jake and Eddie that she knew to abandon the goal they all shared (even as a broken ka-tet).  Although there seemed to be no malevolence involved, I think this was Susannah’s real “temptation before victory” which she failed to resist.  Additionally, I was just a bit disappointed how such a strong character seemed to give out so quickly to her desire to be reunited with her dead loved ones.  I guess my ideal end for her would have had her die protecting Roland against the Red King. As she expires

As for the ending with Roland, letting your own imagination decide Roland’s ultimate fate seems as good an ending as any.  Even so, is there is any other literature or interview(s) where King discusses his own views on the matter?  I would like to know if he feels that the horn was literally an important element of Roland’s eventual salvation or more of a metaphorical element (I suppose there’s no reason why it can’t be both).

As a lot of fans say, but a whole ka-tet of them. To say it was the best thing I've ever read would not be enough. I've been telling my fiance to start it ever since I started last year, so I'm hoping I can get him to pick it up soon. I love hearing what others think about it, and talking about it just makes me love it more. I find it incredibly hard to explain this feeling to others. The Dark Tower series holds a special place with me now, and always will.

I've been looking for a place to ask this... amazing to see a sub-reddit for The Dark Tower!

I've been slowly reading The Dark Tower--I've been really enjoying it but the enjoyment screeched to a halt in Book IV. I thought the book dragged on--everything I loved about the first three books wasn't really at play here. W+G made me realize that I was much more interested in the learning about the ""situation"" of the Dark Tower and less about the characters. I realize how weird that must sound, and what's holding it all together. W+G just felt diversionary, and very long.

This isn't to say its a bad book! I know there's a huge part of the Dark Tower fanbase that considers this the best in the series.

So here are my questions: is Wizard and Glass indicative of where the next three books are headed? If I didn't like Book IV

I have been a King fan since my very early youth- reading his short stories

Today I finished the first in the Dark Tower series

Basically, and introduced characters you cared about, to kill them all without and real emotion from our supposed hero.  I understand that King started this book when he was a teenager essentially, and I kept all of that in mind while reading it.  (""I am reading something that someone essentially ten years my junior wrote"".)  

So my honest question is- are the rest of the books in this same vein?  Does our hero gain a moral compass that is one we can get behind?  Is it honestly worth the investment of the other books

My hypothesis is that the ""other worlds"" can only exist in time after K-Earth but before All-world.

A potential problem for this of course is the fact that Roland pulls Susannah from the early 60s, and it is not unreasonable to posit that the relationship between K-Earth time and All-World time might not have remained constant. K-Earth's time may have moved faster at some times and not quite so much faster at others. I also think I remember reading Ted Brautigan talking about how it ""slips"" forward once in a while.

Perhaps there are some worlds that detach from the tower, for example, the beams form some sort of cage around the multiverse, this would explain why the breaking of those beams results in those worlds being destroyed. A beam breaks, the worlds it holds in fly out into todash and are eaten. It also explains why some of the doors underneath the Crimson King's Castle led directly into todash. If all the beams broke (or all but one), then all the worlds would detach, the tower would snap and All-World and K-Earth would fall into todash as well.

I also gave some thought to the geography of All-World. I got the impression that All-World should roughly match the other worlds, then the Mohaine Desert could be a future desert covering Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The mountains Roland travels under could be the Appalachians, the Western Sea could be the Atlantic Ocean, which places Lud right where NYC is today. Then the Wastelands would be what was the Midwest, and Topeka sits where it sits. The Callas would be the western prairies. Empathica the rocky mountains, but I've never seen a full

EDIT: I've done some more thinking. If All-World's geography matches that of earth, etc. Perhaps in All-World's past something spurred the homogenization of White American and Latin culture. The entire culture seems to mimic that of the Southwest. Alternatively, the Baronies could also have been based in South America. Northern Argentina is a likely candidate for New Canaan. This also lengthens Roland's journey considerably, fitting better with the implied narrative.",,False,,True,t3_kmxjx

OK, at the end of the novel Has time (events) reset itself or is it moving forward?


In the keystone world and near the tower


The Man in Black


So is Walter/Flagg alive again


Does this mean the Breakers are back to breaking now? The wolves are back to wolfing?  


The implications of this are pretty broad. Because that means the tower is back in danger


Is it never really in danger


On the other hand, but Gan just keeps sending him out and giving him the hints necessary to protect itself.  I get the sense that Gan is the type of laid back entity that knows it is all powerful and that it only needs to give little pieces a shove now and then to protect itself. The Crimson King and all the breakers and all their little plans are nothing compared to it.
