Last week I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/1eik0y/i_had_this_idea_for_a_whattolookforina_subreddit/) post on /r/BuyItForLife and my idea about a subreddit where the users can exchange information about what is important to look for in a purchase motivated me to open /r/WhatToLookForInA . Here is part to the Mission Statement and Rules post

Welcome To What To Look For In A!

Instead of regurgitating principles of conduct

I am Italian, knowing that in most cases the same thing I love home won't be available to them.

Same thing happens to me when I look at products suggested on Reddit and discover that in many cases those brands are available only in the US and Canada.

So I started instead to give and ask for tips in how to recognize a good product for a specific purpose and, I discovered that in Europe we have most of the products that people suggest on Reddit, just under another brand name or with little differences that don't matter.

WhatToLookForInA is a place where to learn how to buy things so to get you time and your money's worth.

Other two contributions you could make to the subreddit are:

- to spontaneously create a guide to purchasing a product you are an expert of. Add [Guide] at the beginning of the title of such a post.

- Propose yourself as a mentor for a specific kind of purchase. In this case you can also freely vaguely specify your location,False,self,t5_2ue68,False,,,t3_1eurrv

Preferably COLOR laser printer, and a scanner is a huge plus (almost mandatory), but printing is obviously the most crucial.

My main concerns are: 

1. Reliability - every printer I or my family has ever had ended up having problem after problem, rather than crapping out like they always do.

2. Cost effective - the ink cartridges must have good value. Many people buy the printer and think 'oh boy that was a good price!' to find out later the ink refills cost an arm and a leg. This is a major consideration

3. Customer service/warranty - I've learned over the years that with anything HP, no one is there online or on the phone to help you, the online help center never addresses your issue, etc etc etc. I'm looking for a company that not only has the gumption to sell me a printer, but the balls to stick around and offer support during the time that I use it as well. I'm afraid of buying something then being given the cold shoulder by a company or retailer and I'm stuck with yet another broken printer.

4. Connectivity - I have a mac. I would love to have a wireless/bluetooth setup, or pc with some really shitty mac-version software). I want something I can plug in and print, not something that installs a bunch of bloatware and shortcuts on my computer and hassles me with popups for the rest of my life.

 I'm not against buying used if it's a solid

I know these are a lot of demands to make on something like a printer, and freelance designers, I'd hope someone has found a printer that can do the job!
