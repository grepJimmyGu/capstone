It baffles my mind how unlikable her character is. Honestly, and this episode cemented my opinion. I mean COME ON. She shows up acting like everything is fine, despite being told multiple times that there's just been an attack on the prison survivors, and when Rick initally asks her if she's alone, she doesn't even reply, and acts like she has some kind of sense of entitlement to the group. Just when you think you couldn't possibly like her any less, she actually lacks the common sense to just notice that Shane and Lori aren't with them anymore
You have to ask Rick of all people what happened to them?

What really made me pissed is that she simply doesn't listen to rational information. When Carol is telling her about what happened to Shane, seeing as she was banging Shane in season 2. What really boggled my mind here was what Carol then said immediately after, that Shane was going to kill Rick, had lied about Randall, and that he had loved Lori the whole time. Andrea, instead of factoring in that 1) Shane was going to murder their leader, and arguably best asset to the group, YOU WERE THE THING ON THE SIDE. (sorry for the caps, the only real thing she heard and has a response to is ""Rick killed Shane.""

One of the greatest scenes so far, and yet it was clear just how bad things are out there outside the fences of a farm.  A kid once told repeatedly to ""stay in the house"", is now a long-haired kid expected 8 months later to help clear them with military precision.

Arguments over who's job it is to cook a nightly dinner with all the fixins' have taken a back seat to whether or not we've come to the point where one questions whether a can of cat food is acceptable food or not yet.

Then they find the prison, and I as a viewer, again begin forgetting how gnarly things are in the open again.

Then we see Tyreese and his group

I know I know...the characters and story both need to evolve in a post-zombie apocalypse world. And I know a lot of people think it's awesome that everyones being so badass now

Begin rant/

I MISS THE SHEER TERROR AND HORROR THAT CAME FROM THE WALKERS. For example, I don't think any living, human villain can incite that amount of fear and intensity in the audience. I don't read the comics, so I didn't have any expectations for the governor, but honestly, I really don't see the craziness/madness in him that everyone else seems to see. Sure, he snapped in the finale, he just seemed a tiny bit more out-of-it than Rick or Shane would've been in his position.

It's for this reason that I've started losing hope in this show. Almost every episode of season 3 seemed to drag on to me. I know people say this show is supposed to be character-driven and not focused on walker-killing all the time (and I agree)

What do you guys think?

1361010113.0,18msf7,[SPOILERS S3E9] Getting tired of all the new problems,timewarp01,99,26,21,"After watching the Suicide King, more than the environment

That being said, another rapidly appears in its place. There's always somebody dying, leaving, getting injured, being sick (mental and/or physical), not cooperating, or causing more problems with an accident or strongly held moral conviction. The third season's beginning was certainly emotionally exhausting, what with the walkers *inside* the prison, not feel sorry for them.

The show seems to have comprehensively shot down any hope of a final resolution to the zombie situation; a cure is out of the question, now Daryll has left, Rick's losing his shit, Glenn is pissed at Rick, and the Governor is about to wage war.

I realize this is only the third season and there has to be a constant influx of new conflict to keep the story interesting

**EDIT:** Ok, but succeeded by telling a zombie survival story that was unlike any before it; it was new and fascinating. Now it seems like the show is running our of steam and coming up with more and more predictable, less original material. For the past few episodes it's been fairly easy to make some pretty good guesses about where new conflicts would spring up and what would happen to old ones. I don't think anyone thought the Governor would turn out to be a good guy or that Merle would reintegrate peacefully with the group or Michonne would actually kill the Governor or no one would die during the rescue mission. It seems quite obvious now that the Governor will attack the prison, Andrea will eventually have to dramatically choose between the Governor or her old group, Tyreese's white friends will be a problem, Tyreese and his wife will help if not join the group, Rick will eventually get over being insane,,1361064192.0,t3_18msf7

For some reason, from generation to generation by old narrative songs.

It's not a major concern to any plot points in the show, documented history would be important and necessary.  Maybe most of the group members don't think this is important b/c they see no future.  They're all a step or two away from Morgan, thinking that it's already over and the inevitable end of all of man is a forgone conclusion.  

What I didn't expect was how much of a focus history would be in this episode.  Even in his madness, making a historical record for those who will come upon his ""home"" decades and decades later, assuming the booby traps don't get them.

I think this is where Carl proves that he can be a member of the future society that evolves the human race from a mass of nomadic waring tribes back into a society that more resembles the world prior to the outbreak.

On Talking Dead, there will be no connection, tangible anyway, to the people that came before b/c what will be left of the before will be gone.  If you lose your sense of your own history, you lose the part of yourself that makes you human.  Something as simple as a picture works to prevent that.

Carl took a step towards preserving history for future generations, even in the face of so much misery.  Rick has tried to show that keeping that little bit of our civilized selves was most important - maybe more important than simply surviving.  Carl's actions speak to that same premise and risking his life for the sake of preserving his history speaks volumes about him as a character.",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,

**EVERYONE has the virus**

**EVERYONE who dies will turn**


It is certain there was an event that took place which made this happen be it man-made or supernatural. 


IF it was man-made it would stand to reason there would be some people beyond the reach of society that would NOT be infected unless it was airborne and could literally infect the entire earth (HIGHLY improbable if they want to adhere to any semblance of reality which to date they have). 


If it was supernatural the series would certainly veer off in to a different direction than it has been heading as there has been very little mention of anything religious aside from a few people relying on their faith. 


At some point this will need to be addressed otherwise the plot will get repetitive and it will just be killing off old characters and introducing new ones.

1363923153.0,1as2lc,SPOILERS [Wild Theory Alert!!! Is There a Morgan/Gov Connection?] (/spoiler),Prof-Professore,78,23,35,"Okay



Is there some sort of connection

In ""Clear"", and Michonne happen upon Morgan.  Some crazy ensues, but all is ""well"" for just about everybody but the backpacker come show's end.
  
Clue #1
(During the episode, unpin them, and throw them on the pyre.

Clue #2
Morgan eventually takes note of Rick wanting all these weapons, what happened to all those people?  All zombie kills?  Maybe, but Morgan's seems to know how to deal with walkers without much confrontation.  I could see a few people getting killed, but Morgan's traps could keep an entire town safe from zombies - maybe not a large group of humans, though.  Also, Morgan's reaction isn't one where it just dawned on him that there's going to be a fight.  It's as if he's seen that kind of thing go down before.  Maybe experienced it himself?  I mean, it's kind of ironic that he calls out Rick for stockpiling weapons for a fight while he has an entire police weapons cache up in his apartment.  Why all the guns

Clue #3
In the next episode, this implies The Gov had Rick n' Co. trailed.  At the very least, this tells me The Gov knows about Morgan.  Does that mean Morgan was killed and the rest of his weapons taken?  Well, if The Gov. never knew of Morgan until that moment Rick got the guns, I'd say yes, but what if The Gov knows Morgan?  What if they have a history or an agreement of sorts?  Did Woodbury wipe out Morgan's crew?  Was Morgan himself or his people once part of Woodbury?

Clue #4

Somebody else has a zombie trap

Could Morgan have designed that trap?  Was Morgan at one time one of Woodbury's people?  Did he have a conflict with The Gov.?  Maybe he and some others were able to escape before shit got crazy.  Later on, so he just left the crazy fucker alone.

Kinda Sort Clue #5?

What was the deal with the police bag in Phil's room?  They showed shots of it in the season's earlier episodes.  Did we ever figure out whose it was?  Some said it was or wasn't from Rick or his police station

So


I know it's a long shot, I still think there is a connection between Phil and Morgan that might play a role in the last two episodes.

**Edit:  Okay

**I went back and watched ""Clear"" again for some confirmation of my assumptions.  First of all, Morgan tells Rick that they will be ripped apart by teeth and bullets and that he doesn't want to see that again.  This all but confirms there was a battle of some sort that Morgan either took part in or witnessed.**

**Another interesting point is what Morgan says when he first sees Rick after waking up.  Rick asks Morgan if he knows who Rick is and Morgan says something about Rick being a man who wears dead men's faces.  Now, and Morgan is saying things about Rick not clearing and that he turned.  He says Rick died.** 

**Okay, if you look at the driver, it appears to be a woman from the body type.  You can't tell b'c of the body armor and mask.**

**When we first see Morgan again, shin guards and a mask.  I know it's not the same outfit as the zombie bomb driver, but I did notice that if not for Morgan's voice, you might not be able to discern it was a man under those clothes.  When he comes down to get Rick and is shot by Carl, he does have a kind of feminine body shape.**  

**The zombie bomb truck was filled with zombies caught in (if my theory is correct) Morgan's pit trap.  Was Morgan once tasked with gathering zombies

**Morgan's comments about Rick wearing a dead man's face, covered in walkers and unable to fend them off.  The Gov and his crew pull out just before the Dixon's show up to save the day, so if Morgan were there, he may have thought Rick had been killed.**

**None of this is probably true

* Axel lived during the shootout?

I think that Carol would've actually found herself in a love triangle, Axel would bring some more humor into the show. The only thing that worries me is what he might've done to Beth had Carol not been there.

* Rick was too late and Hershel died because of his bite?

The group would definitely lose themselves without Hershel, possibly resulting in Beth's suicide. This would bring Maggie into a depression that even Glenn couldn't bring her out of.

* Andrea was bitten instead of Amy?

I don't care how much you might hate Andrea, and *Amy* was the ""bitchy"" one. I can't really see Amy's character development getting too far. Also, if she were to make it all the way to meeting Michonne (which she wouldn't), then the whole Woodbury issue would've been a lot different.

* Daryl and Merle switched places

This is an interesting one. I think that Merle would've caused great conflict within the group, that would've been interesting to see. Also, the group might not have survived considering the fact that Daryl seemed to be their main source of food through hunting. It's possible that Shane or even Rick would've killed Merle at some point. And imagine Merle's reaction to losing Sophia. Yup. Nothing.

* Ed was alive

This might have affected Sophia greatly. It's really hard to see what would happen. There would be no possible Daryl/Carol situation, would've caused many problems in the group, and would probably end up killed by Shane.

* Andrea still stayed in the CDC with Jacqui and Jenner *knowing* that Dale would die with her?

The group didn't have Hershel as a replacement moral compass yet, so they wouldn't have made it far before dying. Also if, let's say, Shane or someone else in the group knew how to keep the RV going, Dale was the one who noticed the herd first, and Rick was the second, but mostly because he noticed Dale thought something was wrong. Also, Carl's speech to his father at the end of the season might have gone somewhat differently

* Morgan's wife, but Duane was dead?

This is a very tough one to imagine. This would've greatly affected how Morgan would take care of Rick, regardless of whether or not Jenny were to die between their two encounters.

* Milton worked at the CDC and Jenner was the scientist at Woodbury?

I think this one would make a greater difference than all of the ones above. Think about it: Milton was definitely afraid of death, using it as a fortress against zombies. Now, let's say Milton were to still lose TS-19, but instead of blowing up the CDC, he left it along with the rest of the group and made it to Hershel's farm. I'd like to see a much earlier Hershel making friends with a much earlier Milton. As for Jacqui, I'm not sure how she'd affect the group the whole way in.

Being caught in this war between, wouldn't it be better for them to just try to leave Woodbury and then go on on their own, and not try to join Rick's group? (It's obviously possible that this is what happens, but that they then bump in to Rick's group and decide to join them then.)

Obviously there is an advantage in being part of a larger group, and in that [those who died from walkers only did so because they were shot, allowing the walkers to overrun them] (/spoiler)) and as such Tyreese and Sasha would probably have a better chance surviving on their own than participating further in the Rick v.

I hope you are all pumped for tonight's episode. It's been a long while.

That said, and that is awesome! It is so amazing to think that we've come from just 100 or so subscribers in just a year. So, claps for all! This is awesome!

However, and that is perfectly understandable. Since a new episode airs tonight, I figured now would be the best time to remind everyone of our policies. 

**1) ABSOLUTELY NO DISCUSSION OF THE COMIC BOOK

Yes, but we'd just ""get it"" if we read the books, this is done to pay homage to the books, yadda yadda. Many of our subscribers have in fact read the comics, but many others have not. This subreddit was created to discuss the separate animal that AMC has created and while an understanding of the comic may feed into the show, many of us want to appreciate the show without comic spoilers. Taking a blind approach to what is happening in the show can also really vamp up excitement for a lot of viewers!

**2) Self-policing is best-policing.**

Over the break, too. We scour the comments and new posts daily (and depending on the circumstances, sometimes hourly) to check for violations of our spoiler policy, and we don't always catch everything. It makes us so happy to see users commenting, ""Hey, can you edit your post? It violates such and such a rule,"" but it helps us if you also clickity clack that ""report"" button so we can remove the comment if necessary. That said, right there. 

**3) Any pre-release spoilers should be posted in a separate thread. If you are talking about anything shown in ""Next Week's Preview

Again

**4) Don't put spoilers in the title. Seriously guys. Our friends across the sea often can't watch for much later than the US

____

**Do we have a policy on comical images/memes/etc.? Not yet. So far, things have been a bit dead** ^^hehe **so we loosened this policy a bit. Now that the show is back, we'd like to go back to OC and intelligent discussion. If you think this policy should be changed, please discuss it in the comments below!**

If you have any suggestions for policy changes, we'd also like to hear about it.

* Control over Woodbury
* A safe haven to ride out the zombies
* Revive his daughter and find a cure
* Andrea
* Michonne's death
* The prison gang's deaths

I just can't figure out where some of these motives are coming from,,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,True
1331771888.0,qx11l,I think I figured out why Rick didn't reveal what Jenner said in his last transmission to Morgan. [Speculation. Spoilers.],obediah,57,8,57,"So, and to put a reveal off for so very long - especially after teasing us with it in the second season's opening monologue - and then for it to turn out to be something the fans predicted long ago

Now, there must be some twist in store. I mean, if all Jenner said is that everyone is infected then why would Rick refuse to broadcast that on his walkie? I figured it was because Rick thought that people would lose hope when they found that out, or that he didn't want to accept it himself, or that he didn't want to tell that to whoever was listening before he knew it was true. But reasonably, it seems like keeping that information to oneself puts a lot of people in serious danger, and that doesn't seem like Rick's style. So what is the dramatic and shocking revelation that Rick could be keeping to himself that we have so far failed to guess? 

Here is my speculation. Unfortunately, right? That Rick had hope even when in truth hope was dead? So, it would make sense that that initial monologue was in retrospect just the introduction of Rick's naivety and denial. But in fact, the implications are much larger. If everyone becomes a walker after death, that does not simply mean, “oh shit, all these people I'm with will turn into walkers, I'm going to turn into a walker whether I like it or not, death as we know it, everyone that will ever exist from here on out will become walkers when they die. Walkers will *by definition* outlive humans. 

One of the most exciting parts about post-apocalyptic fiction is the concept of starting over, forever renewing fact. The world is not over because of this one apocalypse, the world is in a state of horrific apocalypse forever more. The hope that humans can band together and possibly reclaim an existence free of the walking dead is ruined because the more that humans overcome and thrive, well that is simply the more assurance that zombies will persist in overwhelming numbers.  While this doesn't exactly validate Rick's decision to keep this information to himself, it does increase the gravity of the situation significantly in a way I had not considered until now. It's the kind of thing that could destroy hope irreparably, which might have the existentially chilling effect that Jenner's info sort of lacks on its own.

Now, I thought it was a cool enough realization that I'd post it.

After all the complaints about pacing, I think this episode was pretty much perfect.

I'm excited about what they are doing with Rick and Lori's relationship, as many lesser shows would have done because viewers of ""action"" shows tend to have little patience or appreciation for ""dramatic"" conflict.

I like that despite the ""not a democracy anymore"" line, I was afraid the end of last season set the group up for conflict too conveniently, with Rick finally going off his rocker much like Shane did. Instead we are more invested in these characters because we can actually appreciate their decisions, not just sit around thinking ""stop being so stupid!"" which I think is the typical state of horror media.

On that note, and adaptive. Though still not perfect, of course - it remains a TV show with limited ability to depict 100% believable plans - the number of arbitrary problems/mistakes/coincidences for dramatic effect is very low, this makes the drama and suspense in tense situations much more real.

I especially like that we are starting with a group of people who seem to finally understand the world they live in and don't just bitch about silly things for the sake of narrative conflict.

1370828475.0,1g0mn1,[SPOILERS 3x12] A twisty interpretation,mykro76,56,23,27,"Ok I haven't watched beyond Clear yet ... but what if Morgan is a figment of Rick's imagination?  It's just some survivor on whom Rick has superimposed Morgan's face.

Evidence:

- The guy didn't recognise Rick from the rooftop or when first waking up.
- Michonne and Carl have never met Morgan
- Rick is inadvertently priming the guy with a lot of facts:  ""My name is Rick Grimes.  You know me.  You saved me.  I gave you this.  I said I'd turn it on every day at dawn"".
- When the guy ""recognises"" Rick
- As the vision takes hold
- At the end of the conversation
- Rick: ""You're not seeing things right"".  He repeats this twice. Is it his own subconscious trying to break through to him and dismantle the vision?  ""You can come back from this. I know you can.""
- At this point the guy gives Rick a very puzzled look.  He just wants to get this crazy man out of his house.
- Michonne's comment before they leave
- Occam's Razor.  It's more plausible that this is just more of Rick's crazy than it is that both Rick and Morgan are crazy.

This is a hardened group that appears to have spent a large amount of time on the road (as Tyreese states they haven’t been anywhere this safe in weeks)

Who screamed? To me it sounded like a woman’s scream, so I can’t imagine her screaming louder for no reason. The other woman seems like the most wary of the group, as she sees the danger of bringing the bitten women with them, so why would she scream an act potentially more dangerous.

I can only see two possible explanations to this;
1) It was the kid in the group as he seemed pretty hysterical. Though he looks about 16 and it would be a bit weird if he screamed like that
2) It is someone outside of the group we see

Spoiling most of LOST here:
In LOST you had Sun, weak, character that really didn't do much except look scared and fall down. I wanted her to get eaten by the smoke monster for her lack of character. But then Season 4 happens, and I see her putting a gun up to everyone's face, and not dying from childbirth on the island. Plus you got to see her before she became timid, and you realize what kind of shit she went through to put her in that submissive state. It was once she broke out of her shell, she started to become a very strong character.
TWD Spoiler time:
Now in TWD, is weak, timid, has a wierd shaved head (I personally think her hair has been shaved out of her fear of what her husband would think), and is completely controlled by her husband physically.

Her husband getting eaten in the camp attack gives her oppurtunity of freedom, ecspecially one like Rick.

With only Sophia left, for anyone to still not blow their brains out at this point, is some serious fucking willpower. 

We go to the Season 2 opener, and got chased into the woods (this is all her own damn fault, I don't blame Rick at all for her death). This all happened right in front of Carol. She watched her daughter in a helpless state of fear, and disappear. Fuck. 

We don't need to discuss the Sophia crap, Sophia's reveal wouldn't have had the weight of impact that it did) now Carol has nothing left, except for the hope that Daryl still cares for her (I personally think she loves him subconciously. Daryl is totally the man she always wanted, imo)

Here's my take:

I know a lot of people want the Governor to die.  But there are a lot of people in Woodbury who look up to him and depend on him as a figurehead and leader.

And Merle.  Ooooooh baby something is going to happen with Merle for sure.  The moment the Governor lays eyes on Michonne he is gonna be *pissed* at Merle.  And the moment Daryl and Rick find out what Merle has been doing to Glen (and what he might do to Maggie) they're going to be pissed as well.

So how will this come together?  Maggie (or someone else) puts a knife in the Governor's head and Merle takes over Woodbury as the main villain for the second half of the season?  Merle abandons the governor and dies a hero's death saving Daryl from him?

But if they both die

I want to say ""There's no way Andrea will side with Rick and Daryl"" but I might be underestimating Michonne's influence.  Those two have been through a lot together even if it was mostly implied.

**2.** After the episode, either she is not dead or the writers are still trying to hide something about her character (possibly turned, maybe still on cast for flashbacks, etc).

**3.** The are rumors that her character was cast in later episodes this season. This could mean she is alive

I know I may be stirring up a hornets nest by making a thread devoted to Lori, and that people mean to say she was encouraging Rick to kill Shane. This may or may not be the case, but the way I see it Lady Macbeth's intentions in encouraging her husband to kill his competition was for the sake of ambition and personal gain. Lori was more doing it as a legitimate warning to Rick, who she probably thought a little naive and unable to see past his friendship with Shane, and if it was to instigate murder it was more to stabilize the group and prevent further harm to anyone who got in Shane's way. As for the most recent conversation, I personally think she did the right thing being so candid with Shane about her thoughts. It seemed to me an attempt to mend things, to express to Shane the well deserved gratitude he was in a way robbed of, which also sounds tones of Lady Macbeth.

Now, but I am admittedly unfamiliar with the particular complexities of that play, and I've always had a hard time putting my finger on what exactly Lori represents and means in the scheme of things.

So while some say it was awful and some say it was meh

I hope the prison gets one final attack by the mid-season finale, Shumpert (the black guy), and maybe two or three other guys he managed to pick up along the way lead an assault on the prison. (Remember, Rick and Maggie in the mid-season premiere were enough to send Woodbury scattering--I'm sure that four or five heavily armed guys can lead a decent assault. The first half of the season shouldn't show them much and focus on the group: maybe Morgan returns, Carl's relationship with Rick, Judith growing up, Carl starting to reveal his hinted-at crush on Beth, a huge shocker should come as the Governor and his crew return and lead an attack. Rick and co. quickly gather up and prepare, and Hershel can't take it. As the Governor closes in, and the two are separated as they flee the prison while the rest of the group gives up. The Governor's forces manage to get walkers into the prison as Rick's original group leaves

Rick's group regroups outside, they are on the road for a good portion of the season. I'm still not sure how the finales would play out, though.

With that said

**Graphic novel discussion** - First and foremost, but giving any information found within it is against the rules here. 


**Spoilers** - Do not post spoilers in the title! If you are going to include spoilers in your post
[SPOILERS (Episode#)]. 

An example of a title would be: ""[SPOILERS (1x1)] I have a theory about Rick."" **If a post clearly indicates [SPOILERS] or The Episode Name/Number in the title

Within the context of the post

    [This is a spoiler sentence!](/spoiler)

It will show up like this: [This is a spoiler sentence!](/spoiler)


A big complaint within the main subreddit was the constant untagged spoilers. With this format, you can avoid posts regarding that episode. With that said, as we are making this community available for show-only discussion, there should be no excuse for down voting any comic information in the original subreddit, /r/thewalkingdead.

**Any and all preview information must be spoiler tagged until the episode airs.** 

**PRE RELEASE SPOILERS MUST BE PLACED IN A SEPARATE POST. Absolutely NO pre-release spoilers in episode discussions or otherwise.**

A good rule of thumb for spoilers: When does information STOP being a spoiler? (Shameless steal from CollegeHumor)


*Standard episode - 2-3 weeks

*Season finale - 1-2 months

*Series finale - 2-4 months



**Trolling** - Please do not throw around hate speech here. We are all adults and should be able to get along. Friendly debates about the characters or plot are fine



With all that said, if you have any suggestions about what else you would like to see or other rules that should be implemented, feel free to message the moderators or comment below! If this gets off the ground, we are also considering doing some fun activities for everyone that could leave you with a month of shiny internet gold, just to liven things up a bit.

I understand why the Governor and his soldiers would be. They're the more powerful

But why does it seem like everyone in the prison (sans maybe Hershel) wants this to escalate to war? They act as if they'll kill the Governor and it'll be over. But the other side has dozens of people

The only real way I see the brewing war ending would be with multiple deaths on Rick's side if things go on this way.

I see Tyreese's group going back to Rick, that could be another person on the group's side, but even then, they're pretty screwed.

1332169743.0,r3ihk,My thoughts on Lori and why I like her character,midnight_illusion,27,23,27,"Does anyone else get the scene between her and Rick or is she just a ""stupid bitch"" who needs to be removed from the show like most want to assume? Really? I don't get it to say the least. What do people expect? Just because it's an apocalypse everyone needs to be OK with running around with shottys blowing peoples heads off?

Since the beginning of season 1 Lori has made it clear that she didn't want Carl getting caught up in all of this hoopla. It's nothing new. They really begin to emphasize it in season 2. 

* Firstly her ""little boy"" gets shot: This would put ANY mother on edge. 
* She has conflict with Rick during his healing time thinking that it MAY be best for him to not grow up in what seems to be a world not  worth living in. 
* She HATES the idea of Carl getting involved with the guns: What mom wants there 10 year old (or whatever age) toting around a gun blowing heads off of what what used to be people?

She has this dilemma from the get go though and the show has done a great job at slowly evolving her character and her struggle with this idea. The last scene with her and Rick, she backed off a bit. That was more of a ""I can't believe we let things get to this point"" in my eyes. What really threw her over the edge was the fact that Carl, her son, was the one who put Shane down in the end. A man who Lori had just given thanks to for saving their lives and a man who was essentially a second father to Carl. For as much trouble Shane caused I think the last thing Lori wanted was for her husband/son to be involved in the death of him. Lori is a conflicted character. One minute she is telling her husband he is dangerous and something needs to be done (she doesn't say go Kill him mind you) and the next minute she is thanking Shane for all he has done. This is clearly a woman torn between two men one way or another. She felt guilty in my opinion. 

All in all Lori isn't just the ""bitch"" of the show. I think she is a strong character that we are seeing evolve every episode. I think she is finally coming to terms with the fact

Those are my thoughts though. There are 1000 threads in the other sub meme related or just bashing her and I don't really understand why. I had to rant. ",,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/r3ihk/my_thoughts_on_lori_and_why_i_like_her_character/

**1.** Almost every other character that we believed to be dead came back alive. Take for example the prisoner, either. So, I think it is safe to draw the conclusion that any death not specifically shown can't be assumed.

**2.** After the episode, either she is not dead or the writers are still trying to hide something about her character (possibly turned, maybe still on cast for flashbacks, etc).

**3.** The are rumors that her character was cast in later episodes this season. This could mean she is alive


I definitely don't want her to turn into a zombie. That would be cruel after what happened in the last episode. If she is done, but I think she was just being a pregnant b***h.

1:Why the hell did AMC have to kill the only character I was connected to and cared about on the show? Everyone else is too narrow sighted, and that I am going to stalk his IMDB page.

2)Why do we have T-Dog if he serves no purpose to the story other than 'the black guy'? Other than the episode that they dropped the N-Bomb 20+ times he has had 3 lines at most. Let's hope he gets a part eventually... maybe I'll keep watching if he does.

3) Darrel was a great character at the start of the show. He was loyal to his brother and somewhat unpredicatble in the first season and started to bloom in the second season. He nearly died looking for Sophia

1364430003.0,1b59i3,[Spoilers] - S4: Goodbye Rick?  The Era of Tyreese?,Prof-Professore,12,13,6,"I've been bothered by the inclusion of Tyreese for sometime.  I've not read the comics, he kind of fell off

Those scenes where we have had Tyresse interact with Carl, however, as more than just a part of the ensemble cast.  I don't know what it is, exactly, but the way he's played and his presence on screen puts him on the level of both Rick and Phil - and it's not just b/c he is a leader of a group.  He seems to have been set up to a much bigger influence than as another blind mouse for Phil or even as a welcomed addition to the prison kids.

I know the number of deaths has been set at 27 according to Lincoln, others think maybe it'll Glen, Maggie, or both.  It could be Judith, Carol, or even Carl.  Very few have said Rick will die, and like a lot of others, I'm not so sure.

When you look at Rick's story arc, found himself slipping dangerously close to being a dictator and a mad man as a result, and found redemption, giving his power to decide how to live and how to die back to the group.  Rick seems to have come full circle as a character, and while in comic books we see characters come, go, comeback, go, characters that take a path like Rick's are usually done.  They either end the movie

Then I thought about how that could happen.  Would Daryl become the leader?  Could that even work?  I don't think so.  Neither would it work with Glen, Sasha, and any others who survive Woodbury for the beginning of S4.  When the second half of the season hits, a year from now, I could then see what was left of Rick's group returning.  Maybe Daryl and Michonne are paired up and running together.  Maybe Carl has taken his father's place, and while not running a group on his own, is a part of the inner circle. 

I can't imagine the specifics b/c, but I have to believe Tyreese becomes a much bigger player come Season 4.    ",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,

* Why was the cow on the edge of the forest at night and not in the barn?

* Why was the zombie not still on top of the cow eating it? If it was insatiable

* How did the zombie silently tiptoe right up behind dale
