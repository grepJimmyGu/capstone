1371138337.0,1g9utn,Likely MAJOR Kickstarter FRAUD Uncovered: Kobe Red,jmaxcpr,169,38,133,"THE FULL STORY: We went ahead and wrote up our take on the full story as a 6pm PST for those of you coming late. There's a one minute overview of the whole Kobe Situation too: http://bit.ly/kobescam

Last update: We need your support to help fully tell this story and to finish our documentary on crowdfunding. We want to educate
Please consider backing and sharing our own Kickstarter project: http://bit.ly/KickKS

EDIT 1: WHOA! As a couple of minutes ago - Kobe Red's funding was suspended! Clearly this project wasn't straightforward at all. Would have been the biggest fraud in Kickstarter history. We're going after these guys for an explanation. Stay tuned! More updates on twitter @kickstartedfilm

For the last couple days

We first contacted them to send us a video of themselves answering a few questions about their project. After a bunch of red flags and misleading info later
Initially
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kobered/kobe-red-100-japanese-beer-fed-kobe-beef-jerky/posts/507844

Soon after

1) Magnus Fun Inc is not a California registered company. 
2) The email address used to register Magnus Fun's website is the same that was used to register a site called ""Uhadme.com"" - which
3) Amazon Payments for this account is registered to a Desjon Allen - who has the EXACT same Chicago address as Stanley Owens.
4) The student filmmaker they referenced in their post about shooting video for us - someone named Aaron Gerber - is impossible to uncover online - at least in relation to the facts Magnus/Kobe shared.
5) There is NO evidence on any social media we searched or through Google that anyone has been or tasted Kobe Red at any of the taste tests they've reportedly held (One in Boston, and Austin). It seems weird that not one person outside of the message board would make a post about how delicious this jerky is. 
6) All of the accounts defending Kobe - or associated with them - seem to be relatively new.
7) All the normal smell tests on this project come up bad: no names associated with the creators, no tract record, strange start up story with unique elements...take a look for yourselves
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kobered/kobe-red-100-japanese-beer-fed-kobe-beef-jerky

This project has about 90 minutes to go. Definitely something to keep an eye on - I hope it has Kickstarter's attention - as this is a potential major fraud!

tl;dr Some very fishy stuff going on with Kobe Red Beef Jerky!

We'll be looking into this more. Please check out our site as well - as we are also tell the stories of non-fraudulent project creators.
www.kickstartedmovie.com

EDIT 2: Magnus Fun

EDIT 3: Just spoke with the administrators at the Ink &amp; Iron Fest where Kobe Red reportedly handed out samples on June 8th. They were not a vendor there at all (there was another jerky company called Jerky Jerks - but definitely no Kobe Red). It is also unlikely that they handed out the product in the parking lot as it was patrolled by the 60 security guards on staff at the time.

MAJOR UPDATE: Someone claiming to be Aaron Gerber - the student filmmaker Magnus referenced as having filmed with them - has reached out to me directly via Kickstarter. This person has yet to confirm their identity with us. I've made that request. I'd like to clear him of this situation if he is indeed not involved like he told me. He claims to be 17 yo and having been approached by someone named Todd Scott to film this past weekend. He says he was paid $40 to do it (although Magnus the services were supplied for free). Mr. Scott 1) did not have any jerky with him
Clearly something is amiss here - we will update you when and if we get more concrete information.

FINAL UPDATE (6.16): These guys are at it again! They tried to sabotage our film project's Kickstarter these last two days as a form of retribution.

**Descriptive titles**  
  The first big change you can see is that the categories are gone. While it was a good idea in theory, ""A new short film"", ""Save my local ___!"". The whole point of Kickstarter is to fund creative projects, so in your title describe why the project is unique! Why is it worth funding? What makes it different? These are the types of questions that your title should address.  

  **User Flair**  
Another thing we added is user flair. Project creators who have at least $100 dollars backed are eligible for the flair. Just send us a message with proof and we'll add it for you. The purpose of the flair is to give this place more of a community vibe. It should also make it easier to know who you're talking too

 **Rule changes**  
As you can see in the sidebar, not just to plug their own project. We'll be tweaking/adding rules as we get feedback so please make sure to read the rules before you post.

Now
**I'm hoping this community can help us firmly establish that it is indeed the same people and hopefully but an end to their crowdfunding abuse.  Here's a short rundown of what we know already. We're still investigating and will share every new development that we can.**

More on the Kobe Red scandal:
- The two main names we pulled from Kobe Red were Desjon Allen and Stanley Owens. We have some information on both but we can't publish them for legal reasons.
- They have tried to get us off the scent a couple of times - including recently pretending to be a student film maker and telling us the real person behind the scam was someone named ""Todd Alexander Scott."" There's more information on this in the original Reddit thread. 
- I discovered that Desjon Allen - who is a [musician](http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/star-wars/articles/29754/title/saturday-knights#reply) of [some kind](http://www.reverbnation.com/desjondeluxe) - also tried to scam people last year by setting up a phony ""George Zimmerman Defense Fund."" [Here's the original 4Chan discussion](http://pastebin.com/0sTPwKcn) where he was outted for his actions. That link includes contact information I won't/can't verify. I will say that we've seen that 818 phone number associated with Stanley Owens and the address with Allen. *Suspicious*

How they are trying to sabotage our Kickstarter campaign for [*Kickstarted*](http://bit.ly/KickKS) :
- Yesterday we got an out-of-nowhere $10
- This morning around 6am EST, the names were changed to ""4q"" and ""Friend of q."" Around that same time, we got this message from Quentin tto (note: first message is after we asked him to clarify what we should set the $9k goal at). [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/0zQuO0B)
- At this point
- We messaged Quentin back - still wanting to know his motives and more about him - with a really straightforward but polite request. This was that exchange. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ktmPmru). Seems odd that he'd turn on us that fast. He also didn't cancel all three pledges. Only two. The other two were reduced to $1 - seemingly so that could stay on our comment boards and updates. 
- Which is of course what they did next. ""4q"" posted on our comment board just a few minutes ago. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qfXt0mj)
- We're not the only people they've attacked. A user who was also instrumental in uncovering their fraud found out that these guys were trashing his business online.

These guys are trying to attack and spoil crowdfunding. Our film isn't about fraud - although we will likely tell this story in it - it's about the people who use crowdfunding to pursue their dreams. The beauty of crowdfunding is that we, they've tried to steal your money and now they are trying to prevent our success by pledging phony money and trashing us publicly. 

Let's work together to nail these guys. Any information we can drum up will be shared here. We hope you'll do the same. 

**tl;dr - The dudes behind Kobe Red Beef Jerky are actively trying to sabotage our film project's Kickstarter campaign as a form of retribution. We want Reddit's help to stop them.**

EDIT 1: Here are the profiles created by these guys to make phony pledges (which have all since been limited to $1 as expected) and to troll us: [quentin tto](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/61044416), many LOLs b/c they are pretending to be Quentin Tarantino.

1373212532.0,1ht0ww,"5 reasons why I will not be supporting the ""WORLD'S LARGEST CUP OF BOBA TEA"" on Kickstarter",kickstarterskeptic,112,32,17,"Disclaimer: this is 5 reasons.  My lack of correct formatting on Reddit makes it look like it's more.  Skip to bottom for the PDF that's easier to read.

5 reasons why I will not be supporting the ""WORLD'S LARGEST CUP OF BOBA TEA"" on Kickstarter

1.	The 626 Night Market is the one that has created this.  We all know 626 Night Market has made enough money to create this themselves and has in fact already started the process (see point 2).  They will be making money hand over fist on this. 
a.	They are asking people to fund this cup AND the rewards (see point 5).  
b.	They will be charging people to come to the 626 Night Market to see the cup. “We will unveil the cup at our August 626 Night Market.”  
c.	They will be charging the vendors for a booth at the 626 Night Market. “We will unveil the cup at our August 626 Night Market.”  
2.	In the Kickstarter, if you don't hop on, life will continue as usual. Nothing lost. But think about it. If you don't hop on, nothing will happen.”  
a.	Are they saying that the cup won’t be made or it you won’t be personally affected.  Since they have already started the manufacture process
3.	This is a waste of food. ""It will hold 320 gallons of boba tea—that's over 2
a.	Where will they be getting this tea from?  What will happen to the tea after the record has been achieved?  Will it be kept on display for 2 days of night market or will it be drained and refilled the next day?  Assuming this is the most common type of boba tea
b.	2500 cups of boba is a lot of drink to be wasted.   There are better things to do with that food/money.
4.	 It is really not all that big.  “The cup itself will be 6 feet tall situated on a 2.5 feet high platform. The straw will extend its height an additional 3.5' with a grand total height of 12 feet!”
a.	6 foot cup.  Really?  That’s it?  6 feet?  I’ve seen aquariums larger and this is essentially an aquarium.  
b.	What is the current record for “World’s largest cup of boba tea?” How is the record measured?  By gallons?  Total height?  Height of cup?  It shouldn’t be hard to top this.  Make the straw 4 feet and you got a new record.
5.	The financials don't make sense:  ""Boba Cup: $3600 (41%); Construction: $1560 (18%); Rewards: $1514 (17%); Transportation/Storage: $1000 (11%); Mandatory fees: $1151 (13%)""
a.	It doesn’t even add up to $9000.  It adds up to $8225.  Where is the extra $775 going?
b.	Boba cup: $3600 – Please break this down.
i.	The cost of the boba tea? 2500 cups (stated in the Kickstarter) that would be $1.44 a cup.
ii.	Cost to make the cup – From working with aquariums
iii.	Cost of cup and tea – doubtful
c.	Construction: $1560 - Please break this down.
i.	I assume this is the costs of the platform to hold the cup?  Knowing nothing of platform costs I would leave this up to you:
1.	8.33 lbs for a gallon of water.  I assume boba will be similar,560 lbs or 1.28 tons.
d.	Rewards: $1514 – These don’t even make sense… We have to pay for the rewards?  Shouldn’t the rewards be… you know… rewards?  
i.	$15 for name on cup
ii.	$20 for a tshirt &amp; sticker - 100 available &amp; $25 for shirt &amp; sticker shipped -100 available
1.	As someone who has done screen printing
2.	Assuming the basic, but they should state this.  Even assuming $10 a tshirt that’ll be $2000.  That’s not even taking the other rewards into consideration.  Just another in the series of bad financials.
iii.	$600 for 4 inch x 4 inch logo + 3 of previous awards 
1.	$600 for 16 sq in for 2 days of advertising?  Doesn't make good business sense.  Check out the current advertising costs for real advertisement: http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/how-to-buy/rates/.  For comparison $600 you could 2 weeks on a mall display.  Granted that it won’t be on a world record cup
iv.	$3000 for 12 inch x 12 inch logo &amp; 10 of previous awards - 3 available.  
1.	With a diameter of 3.5 feet diameter
2.	Doesn't make good business sense.  1 sq foot of advertising for 2 days.  Check out the current advertising costs for real advertisement: http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/how-to-buy/rates/.  For comparison $3000 you could 3 months on a mall display.  Granted that it won’t be on a world record cup
e.	Transportation/Storage: $1000 – I assume this is mostly Transportation fee?  Getting a public storage would be less than $100 a month.
f.	Mandatory fees: $1151 – Ummm… What are Mandatory fees?  I don’t believe that there are permits or taxes needed for this?  Kickstarter fees?  What is this referring to?

* **RFID
* **Products available online already** Kickstarter is about being part of a project and not about catching you out scamming us on a $100 dollar watch that sells for 20.
* **Apple Anything** By now I am pretty sure that most people have an iphone holder
* **Bamboo** I am all for sustainable products but can we get more than just bamboo?
* **Food carts in your home town** Are food carts the new Starbucks?
* **People that cry** the minute they don't get a product on the very day the project originally set forward to achieve and then spam the comments section.
* **Please fund my trip around 'Enter country name here'** At least give us a decent project you are working on. A photo montage of takeaway food is not good enough.

1370624900.0,1fvf8j,I'm regretting using Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter...,TheClubberScrubber,64,34,20," As the title says

 The main reason I picked indiegogo over kickstarter was it seems at kickstarter only big projects get attention and it also seemed like there were a Lot of projects there that didn't need crowd funding and were just big company's getting others to ''foot the bill''. I am most likely wrong but that whole Veronica Mars campaign gave me a bad vibe. Not only did Warner Bros basically get a free movie but it stole thunder from small business/projects like mine. Of course the very obvious part that Warner Bros Did NOT need help making a movie.  

 I'm running my campaign on a paper thin budget. I don't have funds to have professional videos or photography and I literally have done Everything (Patents, silicone molds and everything else) all by myself to maximize every penny that went into making it this far. 

 With all of that work I've also had my small business and product recognized and granted membership in Startup America Which is a Presidential ordered group to promote small business and inventions. I had to jump through many rings of fire showing hundreds of documents and business plan/financials to become a sponsored member. My company Zynko is also a proud donor to the ''No Kid hungry'' school lunch program.

 I felt if I used kickstarter that all my hard work would go unnoticed when big company's ran campaigns there because of their productions and budget. But... It all came down to the name of the crowd funding site that seems to be crushing my campaign.

1362948308.0,1a1h9f,Something I've noticed - Mysterious high-roller backers. Scam?,Jacqland,43,6,31,"I don't know if I'd call this a *trend*, suddenly **a saviour appears**. There's two explanations for this I can think of.

1. Philanthropist millionaires browsing the ""ending soon"" tab.
2. Scammy pledges

Does Kickstarter have anything in place to prevent the second thing? If a certain %-age of the funding doesn't go through, it seems like a ""clever"" way to get around the ""protection"" of donating to a kickstarter.

Want to know what I'm talking about? Here are two recent examples:

**Scandock**

When I first noticed this project (via tumblr), 4 backers managed to pledge $17k between them (along with 'bumped' pledges from others). Even more interesting is that on Feb 8th, the project managed to make $2500 while *losing* a backer. And even *more* interesting than that is Feb 4th, where they made $9000 without gaining a single backer - ie completely from other backers raising their pledge. The project made $106,683 from 79 backers. That's an average pledge of about $1350 per backer.

However, if you remove all but the highest pledges (assuming that if someone is going to sink thousands into a project they'll want the highest reward tier) you end up with those top 7 backers pledging a whopping **$12591** each.

**""Encounter"" in Bronze**

This is a much smaller-scale project, by looking at the [project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/521982621/encounter-in-bronze) page, we see that the highest-tier, $5000, has been filled, we assume by that one benevolent backer. Also interesting to note is that on March 6th, 4 backers contributed $3000 between them - despite the fact that *none* of the project's reward tiers higher than $225 have been filled (with the exception of the single $5000 reward). 

What's going on? 

Has anyone else noticed projects with ""mysterious successes"" like this?

Does Kickstarter have any way to control for this kind of abuse?

We did a bunch of research (see below) to find that this Kickstarter is using commercially available products without any innovation from the project creators.  How is this a valid Kickstarter project?  This violates the number 1 guideline (see: http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines ) Kickstarter has

This is a link to the Kickstarter: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bc26/ambiolight-a-one-touch-room-makeover .

Kickstarter seems to be getting even worse - not just pre-orders anymore

Cue research to confirm our initial thoughts...

Exhibit A:  The blacked-out ELCO Lighting LED strip.

Image from their Kickstarter: http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/094/160/3640009c97b2aa7a1a8abd0ef898dc6a_large.jpg?1343800796

Note a few things:  The strip design

Compare with http://www.antlisting.com/FreeImages//2011/08/28/_0633548.jpg from many of the eBay posts that come up with a search for ""RGB LED strip"".

The design is the *same*.  The eBay strip has only 3 LEDs per cuttable segment rather than 6

Note how there are two black marks on the strip.  This was done in photoshop to obscure the text ""ELCO LIGHTING"".  Here

This masking of the ""ELCO LIGHTING"" text strongly suggests blatant deception on the creators' part.

Exhibit B: The ""ballast"".

I don't know why they call it a ballast

Going back to the ELCO Lighting page

Exhibit C: The comments.

""We are working to start a business just like anybody else on kickstarter"" http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bc26/ambiolight-a-one-touch-room-makeover/comments
""... Starting a business

This link details more of our research and how the ""creators"" have responded.

TL;DR: Kickstarter is now about purchasing commercially available products from people who claim to be the designers.  So much for innovation...




UPDATE:
They have posted a picture with the ""full setup"" in a new backer-only update.  The LED controller is a perfect match for the one from ELCO Lighting...

It was an unexpectedly huge success

The Kickstarter I ran: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1363989456/zircon-identity-sequence-a-cyberpunk-inspired-jour

The album: http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/album/identity-sequence

Rather than focus on the stuff that went right

1. Think about your most reasonable conservative deadline and add 2-4 weeks to that. In my case

2. If you need to do artwork

3. Check your liner notes / credit materials and any other printed text. Check them again. Have a friend check. Then check them again. I thought I was thorough but I misspelled the name of a performer and left off one of the KS backers in the special thanks. Not the end of the world

4. THINK VERY HARD BEFORE OFFERING T-SHIRTS AS REWARDS. T-shirts are not cheap to make or ship. I ordered 400+ and they still came out to ~$7.50 a shirt. Furthermore, unless you wait for all backer surveys to be in before ordering shirts (this can take awhile and delay things further). Shirts also add a lot of weight (+ shipping cost). If you're going to do them, do them at $50+ not $30, like I did.

5. Try your very hardest to fit rewards in an envelope, packing takes longer, and they have to be taped. The supplies for this cost several times more than envelopes would have. Don't do boxes unless you have a lot of stuff for high-end backers ($100-250+)

6. Think very hard before offering physical rewards to international backers w/o additional shipping cost. International shipping is abysmal. To ship a 1.5 lb box with a CD, it cost me $14 from the very cheapest USPS service. I basically ended up breaking even on that pledge level. Not to mention, I had to do ALL of them by hand - hand-labeling, customs forms, etc. The post office also gave me a very hard time since I had to ship them all manually. If you MUST do international shipping of physical rewards, stick to envelopes &lt;13 ounces. Above that and you WILL have a bad time. 

7. If you are anticipating (or are already getting) more than ~100 orders, or PayPal and actually TEST them. I was relying on Stamps.com but I ran into a lot of trouble at the 11th hour and had to switch to PayPal. I lost time and money needlessly. I should have thoroughly tested my service of choice a good week before I actually needed to use it. Furthermore, I found that I couldn't do international batches through PayPal OR Stamps.com, which added days of manual labor time.

8. If you end up with a large quantity of packages to mail manually

9. Consider using 3rd party fulfillment like Whiplash Merch or Amazon FBA. Looking back, anything with large boxes, international, over 13 ounces (etc) is just really difficult to deal with.",Music,False,self,False,t3_159vmm

**Things we need.**

1. A cool (non US based ) domain. I am feeling something like ""MrAwesome@Ghostmail.sx[1] "" .sx is what The pirate bay uses

2. Make it compatible with TOR.

3. Make it functional and good nice to look at. Why do all encrypted email services have to look like 1995?

4. Features

5. End to end encryption.

6. Self Destruct feature. All email sent to unsecured email addresses like Gmail

7. Temporary accounts and/or aliases for those one time emails.

8. The company has no owner. It is owned by the people. I am not sure exactly how to do this

9. Developer(s) to take our hard earned Kickstarter loot.

10. Someone to make a nifty

11. IOS and Android support.

12... Public elections to pick the caretakers. The potential caretakers should submit an application and a Resume to say the top backers who will then go through them all and choose say 5 - 10 people who will sign an agreement to take care of the website

What do you guys think? I think we can do all this for under 20K and do it in a really professional way. If we can get 5K backers that runs USD $4.00 each.

Feel free to ask anything relating to starting a brewery/business, our travels and adventures in CentralSouthAmerica/MiddleEast/Europe/Africa. We'll do our best to answer.

Our focus is on excellent quality

* We are very active in the Couchsurfing community and would like to have a bigger role in supporting that regionally through events and meet-ups. 

* We are also big Portland Timbers fans and season ticket holders and would like to be the go to stop in Salem for Timbers fans and matches.

* We have plans for a big Salem beer festival that could help draw more attention regionally to our humble city while also encoraging interest in craft beer.


Support online and through our Kickstarter is very important as we try to get this company off the ground. We are also looking for graphic and web designers to revamp our web presence/store and merch designs (info@vagabondbrewing.com if interested). We are hoping to run a t-shirt design contest 99Designs-style very soon.

3)  Team looks organized like they know what they are doing

This is what I thought they could have done better -

2)  No video?
3)  Too many features - unclear presentation of key features / unclear value proposition?

1364393097.0,1b3yrw,Should I try to Kickstart?,misterzen,17,3,11,"Hello there. Ever since the inception of Kickstarter, but I don't know if my projects would fit Kickstarter or be worth it.

I was recently laid off and that is when I decided to finally pursue my passion. I have paid off all of my bills for March and April with the money I had saved Everything else I have gotten from my last check, that money has gone into buying as much supplies as I can. I am finally at a spot where I can make anything I need to, but these supplies are going to run out quickly.

Here are my ideas..

My major project: Themed jackets/hoodies for fans of certain historical warriors. I'd love to crowdsource my first line, so obviously a lot of my funding would go into finding and acquiring that perfect material that would allow for warming in the cooler months and allow the wearer to remain cool in the warmer months. My drawings and sketches aren't too good, so I'm concerned people might see my designs and shrug me off because of that.

After that, paintball/Airsoft, performing arts or anything else people might use masks for.

I'm talking about projects that have been successfully funded and the creator basically takes the money and runs away with it.


I have backed about 20 projects


Some backers have messaged
&gt;Kickstarter itself cannot force the creator to fulfill rewards

However in their Terms &amp; Conditions it says:
&gt;Kickstarter does not offer refunds. A Project Creator is not required to grant a Backer’s request for a refund unless the Project Creator is unable or unwilling to fulfill the reward.


These projects have not been able to fulfill their rewards.

[Mike &amp; Cookies](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeandcookies/delivery-van-for-mike-and-cookies) had 70 backers; the guy sent two updates explaining that he hired people to make cookies


[Who's For Dinner?](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mrwgames/whos-for-dinner-the-card-game) has 90 backers; the creator disappeared after his last update in July
&gt;The schedule: More printing


So


**TLDR**: When a project is successfully funded and the creator either disappears or tells you that they're not giving you rewards, did it solve anything?

**EDIT**: I am fully aware that Kickstarter is not responsible for refunds. I even quoted them where they said that they are not. But I'm explicitly talking about the relationship between the Creator and the Backer and asking that in such circumstances as described above,False,self,t5_2rquu,1363287281.0,,,t3_1aah1t

No more self-help of any kind on kickstarter:

&gt; What is **not** allowed?

&gt;No self-help material (books, emotional, financial, health, medical, sex/seduction, or other self-help advice. (Updated 6/25/2013)

This really sucks for me and my possible customers. I'm an author. I help students to raise or maintain their grades while (sometimes drastically) lowering their study time.

I recently finished my book

I had an idea to use kickstarter -- if I could fund two months of living expenses, and the videos when they finish. Instead, it may take me over three months.

I'm really disappointed. Any suggestions? I could email the kickstarter team and ask for an exception?

&gt;The Omni is the first virtual reality interface for moving freely and naturally in your favorite game.
&gt;
&gt;The Omni takes virtual reality to the next level— allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion that cannot be experienced sitting down.
&gt;
&gt;Applications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, physical therapy, VR architecture
&gt;
&gt;Virtuix is currently preparing a Kickstarter campaign to launch the Omni on June 4th.

This has been more than a struggle but it is what I expected.  I am not an artist nor am I a writer or marketer. I am a programmer and it shows. I come with the same flaws that many of us programmers share including shyness. Though

My fist error was assuming people would look past my art assets and view my game though the eyes of a programmer but I was wrong (now it seems to obvious). I wanted people to see that the mechanics of my game were smooth and simple. Instead they seemed to get stuck on the horribly ugly images I had on my page and in my game. 

Before day one I had my bucket ready and now I'm trying scoop out the water that's sinking this project.

**Updates:**

1. Added [Promotion Image](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#6) to top of page to clarify platform availability
2. I replaced this terrible custom field sketch with a cleaner version. Now that I look back I don't know what I was thinking to have this as the first image on my page. 
  * Fields - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#2) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#3)
3. Redesigned rewards and then redesigned again after getting advice from a graphics designer.

4. Redesigned the headers to make them more readable
  * Headers - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#0) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#1)
5. Changed my profile image to a picture of myself to make it more personal.
  * Profile Image - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#4) [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#5)
6. Placed [listing for artist](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/182x1o/lfartist_to_create_spritesheet_for_top_down/) to design in game sprites. Two promising applicants thus far. 
7. Lastly

**Paid Advertising Overview:**

Another major decision I have made is to stop all paid advertising and focus on social networking more and more. I wish I had figured this one out years ago but I will go ahead and learn my lesson now. 

For the project I ran three ad campaigns:

[$3/day Facebook Ad](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=600311433957&amp;demo_ad=6005854891648&amp;h=AQAH12s6e5y-yBfU) 

* Targeting male Android users between the ages 13 and 50 who lived in any one of the cities that had an NFL team. 
* URL leads to Facebook photo album. 
* [Activity Graph](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#0)

[$20/day Facebook Ad](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=600311433957&amp;demo_ad=6005944534048&amp;h=AQBpalu0BKGMfwYd) 

* Targeting male mobile phone users between the ages 18 and 50 who lived in the United States. 
* URL leads to Facebook post about Kickstarter launch.
* [Activity Graph](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#1)

[$10/day x 2 StumbleUpon Ad](https://www.stumbleupon.com/content/32nGlW)

* Initially I just had a single Stumble Upon ad set at average priority ($10 for 100 views) then added a second with highest priority ($10 for 40 views from more active users). This lead to 3 likes rather than 0 but still far from effective. 
* [Traffic Overview](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#8)
* [Traffic Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#7)

**Social Advertising Overview:**

A few notes on my experience and what I did to spread the word via Websites

* I created a [press release](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=13c86c38468ff8e3&amp;mt=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Da595dcdabe%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13c86c38468ff8e3%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_hcj5pez20%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbTPhoK8VwXb-xdDDLQMkMi7FOOkTQ) and sent it to as many related gaming sites a possible. 
* I sent out requests to my personal Facebook friends
* I created a Website, Youtube, and Reddit Account dedicated to my project. 
  * Twitter - 52 followers
  * Facebook - 77 Page likes (26 are Personal Friends)
  * Youtube - 1300 Views
  * Reddit - 60 Link Karma
* I was featured on the [IGDA Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/igda)
* After meeting some of the guys at TecmoBowl.org through [a post](http://tecmobowl.org/topic/53094-tecmo-super-bowl-like-mobile-games/) they were kind enough to post my Kickstarter on the [Tecmo Super Bowl Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TecmoSuperBowl?fref=ts) page on Super Bowl Sunday

**Kickstarter Statistics:** 

After all this I would have hoped for a better response but here are our statistics as of today:

* [Project Overview](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#3) - 9% Funded
* [Graph of Progress](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#2) - Flat
* [Total Video Views](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#6) - 1
* [Traffic Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#4) - Facebook $160
* [Reward Popularity](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#5)

Hopefully with my updates I see a change but if not I will continue scooping water over the side.

If nothing else I hope this post helps others to understand that artistic assets are not to be overlooked. Had I done a better job preparing my Kickstarter initially I believe I would have had a much more positive response.

i bet some project which did not get founded would be happy to get what they gathered so far. So why not change the structure and do a 1$ kickstarter and everything else with stretch goals. 


this would secure the founding and define the product with stretchgoals at the go. 


i know that is not possible with every project where fix costs are involved but for other products where modular projects are possible i think it has many benefits. 


what do you think?

I know there's definitely some concern with Kickstarters getting backed, with the Kickstarter I'm hoping to make the game even better than I could do myself. 

Right now I'm working on a top down adventure game called Sword 'N' Board. You play as a kid going on an imaginary adventure to retrieve your missing video game console.

I really wanted to take it back to a time when I was a kid and had to actually go outside and use my imagination and play pretend.

I'm having a hard time getting the word out about the game and the Kickstarter right now (I'm literally one guy working on it right now) so any help you guys could give me to help get the Kickstarter seen is greatly appreciated! Even if you don't back it

There is also a downloadable PC demo on the Kickstarter page under the updates section. There is a Mac build available but I've yet to test it.

You can check the Kickstarter out here:

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/817647846/sword-n-board-your-adventure-is-his-imagination

And you can find the PC demo here:

My name is Joseph Nix and I am the lead dev here at Gentlemen Studios, so we decided to put it all out there and be one of the first developers to revisit the classic RPG genre that many of you remember and love dearly.

RaiN is a 32-Bit Action RPG with a player centered approach.  You take control as you develop each of the three playable character's personalities and behavior!  Everything a character says and does changes they way they act and the pacing, players will have to utilize quick, on-the-fly thinking and lightning fast reflexes to master the monstrous inhabitants of Ara.  Switch between characters and utilize their strengths to overcome complex and ever-changing enemy attack patterns in fast paced, real-time action combat!

The project is currently in its final week of raising funds via Kickstarter and we need your help Reddit!  We were able to raise 50% of the funds so far and need a little nudge from you guys (and gals!) to make it to the finish line!  But hey, you get a copy of the game the moment  it is released, as well as invites into the game's various beta phases.  As you donate more the rewards get even more awesome.  We're giving out art books, shirts, and the ability to actually have your ideas represented in the game.


[To find out more about the game and to donate

We are not like most Kickstarters


I will be here to answer any questions you may have about the game or studio.

Thank you for your time Reddit!

To be brief, I've never made one before.

The funding goal is quite small (I think). I already have a lot of friends willing to work on this for free with me; so really I was just hoping to raise a very low budget to cover some of my equipment expenses and to pay the talent (models

I read the kickstarter tips and we used a few test shots on a dslr to stitch together a video to give people a glimpse of the song and visuals. **What strategies are best for appealing to people who have no attachment to the band?** As I said, rather than cynical?**

The story is powerful, class separation, and taboo homosexuality of the rural 50s culture.

The film takes place in a small town in 1956, who discovers her sexuality and self-worth. Her best friend, Mary-Alice, is a self-absorbed teen who is more concerned about her appearance and material objects than the well being of her friend Penny. Hinging on the football season, Penny discovers her sexuality after being taken advantage of by Mary-Alice's brother, Glenn. For the remainder of the 25 minute film, Penny is tried by a series of life-changing events which expose the raw nature of these social issues.

We have our entire film cast, and hints/tips on how to promote our project.

TL;DR - I need advice on how we can reach our goal for our 1950s coming of age film.
