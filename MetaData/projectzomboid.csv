It's been one hell of a fight, and the hordes are beginning to show up right at my doorstep.  If there's any interest, I'll try to do another gameplay video soon.  Sadly, my PC is crap and so is my internet connection, so I don't think streaming is an option for me.

Here are some of the things that I enjoy and don't enjoy about the game.

Enjoy:

* The way the zombies react to the ambient noises.

 Distant gunshots and helicopters (what the hell is up with these guys?  Some douche in a helicopter flew above my safehouse for a whole day and nearly killed me with the 1000 zombies it brought with it) attract all kinds of zombies.

* How certain houses have alarm systems (although I don't really get how some houses don't have alarm systems but their sheds do).

* The diversity in the items and more recently the ability to hunt for your favorite colored pants.


Don't enjoy:

* The combat system.  I do like the range of weapons you can find

  Maybe it's because my guy sucks.

* The ability to get bored in a zombie apocalypse.  Yes

  Maybe my guy is a total badass

What I'd like to see implemented:

* The ability to break parts of zombies so that they'd have to crawl

* The ability to use everything as a weapon

* More survivors/bandits

* More classes/traits when creating a character

1372629827.0,1hdyxu,Some helpful tips for everyone.,cohii,20,2,9,"Okay

1. For help with carry weight

2. You can force a window open, hold E down to go through the window. Now this can set off a alarm, but its always a gamble.

3. Check the windows before entering a house if at all possible

4. You can loot the zombies as well, hammers, nails, weapons such as guns and axes rarely,and food as well. Most often apples for some reason.

5. If you need wood

6. The best water to weight ratio is from the kettle and watering spray can i believe.

7. To cook recipes put all items in your main inventory and then left click the item for options.

8. When starting a game, farming supply's, and next to many houses and main town for looting.

On youtube a good person to watch for tips is the user eckyman. I learned a lot from him.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask.

Today's Mondoid developer update discusses the future of the new map and why the new Muldraugh is so different from the previous version.  Basically it sounds like the intended gameplay as the map progresses will be to get your bearings and some basic supplies in Muldraugh then start to move North towards West Point and eventually Louisville to find more resources (and danger).

But what really caught my eye was this:

&gt;and to the south is… some other interesting stuff. ;)

So I went and looked around South of Muldraught and saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/UGlkrwN.jpg).  A few cemeteries surrounding an army air field.  Yeah

But then I went a little further south.  And I apologize now if this was obvious to those who have been following the development longer or perhaps those who manage to grasp the obvious since the game is set in Knox County but...

Just South of that is [Fort Knox](http://i.imgur.com/fAoETUq.png)!  In case anyone is unfamiliar with it

&gt;The facility is ringed with fences ... is protected by layers of physical security, mine fields, barbed razor wire, electric fences, heavily armed guards, and the Army units based at Fort Knox, including unmarked Apache helicopter gunships of 8/229 Aviation based at Godman Army Airfield, the 19th Engineer Battalion,000 soldiers, and artillery.
There is an escape tunnel from the lower level of the vault to be used by someone accidentally locked in.

1368603315.0,1eddea,Glitches with 2.9.07 Build,Triumph_of_Ferocity,11,0,6,"Where to start? Just on several games I have determined what some of the major errors of this build are. These may be specific to my computer/graphics card but who knows.

* Item 1. Cannot type in a title for a sandbox world. 

Curiously enough I can for a standard game

* Item 2. Storage boxes get corrupted if your character spends too much time apart from them. 

After some testing as long as you stay within the general area of the storage spaces they are fine and storage spaces you have yet to find are also likewise fine. If you use the warehouse as storage and decide to walk to the other side of the highway your stuff has a fair chance of not being there when you return. 

Also you can tell when this glitch is present because the storage containers appear corrupted

2.1 Closets and some garbage bins do not have their own storage space when you try to open them and when you do manage to 'open' them the icon that should represent them as a closet doesn't exist and its as if you were looting the floor.

2.2 Vending machines can start prebugged. 

Vending machines on encounters have been known to appear as other containers containing loot that is generally found in those containers that probably make no sense to find in a vending machine. An example is paint cans or clothes. Although it is funny to wonder how the paint can got in the vending machine in the first place (or how you got it out??) its not really productive.

* Item 3. Alarms are seriously bugged.

3.1 When you save and reload in a house there is a fair chance of an alarm magically starting even though you are already in the house.

3.2 Public facilities like bathrooms without doors can have alarms when you step inside.

3.3 Alarms sometimes followed by a plane or helicopter sound effect cause the plane/helicopter sound effects to be stuck on loop for a random time. These sound loops can also happen without the alarm but they seem to frequently happen with alarms than without. They may be also related to sleeping as they happen when the character is asleep too.

3.4 (Possibly intended?) Alarms cause alarm chains.

Scenario: You set of an alarm

3.5 Alarms don't always stop when the power is off.

3.6 Unlocked houses can have the alarms set

3.7 Houses you have already found to not have alarms can later have alarms.

* Item 4. (Possibly intended?) You can enter through windows with a cupboard or table behind them. 

The consequences of this though are that select houses with these obstructed windows can cause the player to get trapped in the cupboard unable to move. Restarting will not solve this and it is 100% fatal in my experience.

* Item 5. Some houses leave the player unable to navigate through them. 

This can because the hallway is slightly too small

* Item 6. Axes are game crashing.

After some experimenting axes do not always crash but they seem to do so fairly often.

* Item 7. Inventory can get surgically attached to mouse when attempting to move it.

What I mean by this is that if you try to drag the inventory or other windows sometimes the mouse wont let them go

* Item 8. Moving too many items from the inventory to containers (Cabinets

Once frozen they cannot be moved anywhere

* Item 9. Combat skills are bugged.

Using various classes I have discovered that I cannot level up my combat skills. I played as a carpenter and had 600 zombies killed

* Item 10. Naked zombies.

Zombies that you kill will still be there when you find them later but without their clothes. This can happen if you reach an unknown distance away from the zombies or if you save and reload. 

* Item 11. (Probably just not implemented) Certain weapons do not have their own appearance when equipped by your character.

Some of these weapons include the rolling pin that looks like a bat when equipped or the golf club which looks like a crowbar when equipped.

* Item 12. (Possibly intended?) Some doors cannot be opened and the player can walk through them

Usually bathroom doors found in diners

12.1 In one gas station with the not solid bathroom doors it is possible to walk through the wall like the bathroom door to the outside. Zombies can also do this.

* Item 13. Zombies sometimes spawn in already looted houses.

One thing I have noticed is that house that I loot and later revisit for sleeping can have zombies in them with no source of entry. These houses I have usually sheeted all the windows and was careful to make sure all doors were still shut when I left and entered.

* Item 14. Backpacks

This means you can put a completely full backpack into another bag and put that bag into another bag and that bag into another bag. Each bags weight reduction seem to decrease the weight of the original bag. Besides the time consumed to get the first bag out of the other bags there seems to be no problem in retrieving the items.

Edit --------&gt; 
     
* Item 15. Clothing does not spawn with you

Your character does not always spawn clothing when you start a new game

##Some things I wish I'd known at first:

-Your best survival tool is patience and flexibility.  Stay out of danger by taking the long way around if you have to and changing your route and destination based off of zombie movement.  
-Don't be too afraid of staying out past dark or when you are tired
-Before entering a building look in as many windows as possible to check for zombies.  If there aren't any zombies nearby outside give a shout once you're in then listen for any zombies in interior rooms who hear you and start banging against doors.  
-You can loot dead zombies
-Instead of clicking to open/pass through windows use 'e'.  Tap it to open/close a window and hold it down to climb through.  
-Although I think the music is pretty well done I eventually turned it off ('m') so that I could listen better to in-game sounds.  
-Axe durability seems to fall surprisingly fast from fighting zombies but not from chopping trees.  
-Food is pretty unimportant in this build and the bonuses you get from staying fed don't last long enough to be worth constantly worrying about it imo.  My character barely ate more food than I did while playing.  
-Use alarms to your advantage.  Instead of panicking when an alarm goes off take it as an opportunity to know where almost all zombies in the area will be headed and explore the areas they just deserted.  
-Level up lightfooted and sneaking skills early (by sneaking back and forth near a big horde to get loads of xp).  

##A couple of questions I had:

-Does boarding up windows/doors work in this build?  I couldn't figure out how to do it.  
-How do you get to the farm from town?  I found it once while trying to find the town with a character who was very very lost.  ",self,t5_2sdk8,1370646256.0,,claustophobic,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1fw7lu/rc_29b8_26_days_636_zombies_killed_a_few_lessons/

So I remember there being a sort of story/tutorial in the old version but in this version all I get is the sandbox

Another question is I see a lot of people talking about NPCs; did they took out all NPCs like bandits and other survivors? What was the reason to do it? I guess if they took out the NPCs

Last question. I see in the forums about the forum test builds which I guess they are buggy versions of the future builds; however I see build 11

I don't have anyone to share the excitement of this game with yet as I'm the first in my circle of friends to play this. Failed miserably the first two times I played so I read up on the controls and mechanics on the wiki and can't stop thinking about the game now! Here's what's happened so far in my 3rd attempt at PZ.

[My spawn and the area I spent my first week:](http://i.imgur.com/BnfAttf.png)
My character started in the building with the silver arrow. In the first 2 days I managed to get to the convenience store and back to the safe house (looting houses along the way). Saw Cortman Medical Center was next door which led me to slowly working up the nerve to confront my first zombie. It was very satisfying leading them up behind the fence of the convenience store to smash their brains one-by-one (after spending the first two games trying to run to a house I could get into and being chased by hordes

It took a day to clear the Zombs by the medical center

The next morning I opened the door to my safe house only to find a massive horde hanging around outside. Guess it's time to move on. I spent most of the day sorting through my inventory layout, and I'm looking forward to the day I stumble upon my first axe!!!

Day 7 led me to the church - I was hoping to find something of interest inside

That's the extent of my journey so far with this character! Who knows where the next few days will lead. I've heard of a farm to the north that I may try to make it to before summer - I started in March. But first the curious explorer in me wants to raid the warehouses and police station west of my current location.

T'was the dawn of a brand new day in suburbia. As Craig arose from his sheets

 After ""accidentally"" losing his shirt, thinking at first his closet might be a door. Sadly enough, after opening it, he quickly realized two things: Narnia did not lie within, and he needed a cup of coffee. After smashing the walls with his bare fists, he finally punched the door open and headed to the kitchen.

To his dismay

Craig was infuriated by the situation. As a civil engineer, who inherited it from his grandfather. The steaks were vintage - it would be impossible to get them back, and in his mind Craig already plotted a large scale lawsuit against the daring soul who dared to take it away from him. He took the lonely radish in the fridge, and headed out with a bat in his hand and murder in his mind.

He followed the stench of rotten flesh

Craig, playing videogames such a zombie ate my neighbors, medieval and left 4 dead. However, the transition from a monitor to a fullsized drooling individual was a shock. In fact, he was so shocked he forgot how to use his arms, and had to run around for a bit in a memory jog of sorts. By the time his muscle memory kicked in and smashed the zombie's skull to a oozy pulp, he has suffered some minor damage.

Nothing much

After raiding the kitchen for the essentials, closed the doors and had a quick nap. Little did he know that by the time his little nap was over, it was 11pm and dark as the bottom of the ocean outside. In spite of his tries, he simply could not go back to sleep after sleeping for what seemed to be 12 hours.

Craig decided that it was time for some nigh time mischief. If a zombie invasion had indeed kicked in

Little did he know walking around in a neighborhood alien to him in the dark following vague lights and shadows would be part one of his mistake. After rummaging through some trashcans and walking into several walls

Of course that before entering the house

They'd be wrong.

- Is there any way to change the keybindings?  I've just played the demo and really don't care for the 'hold CTRL' to attack but I couldn't find any way to set my own controls.  In the paid version can you change them or play the game with a gamepad?  (I'm also not a PC gamer by any means, and The Longest Journey)

- When does the next update come out?  I saw 'early 2013' mentioned in a couple of different places but is there anything more definite?  Are the system requirements going to change with future updates?  I have a really shitty laptop (can't even run Minecraft)

- Should I wait for the next update before buying?  A lot of people seem to be excited about the next update to the game

- Will the price change?  One of the reasons I was debating getting the game now, but if it is going on sale soon I also don't mind saving $)

- Is there somewhere I can read about all the changes that will be in the next update?  Like I said, etc; but I was just wondering if there's a single list somewhere detailing all the changes to come.

Started by making my way to the Apartment which is sometimes locked so finding an axe to cut it down is useful but hopefully it just unlocked. I check the house to the left for sheets to cover up all windows on the first floor. Then I run next door and empty that grocery store out. I would suggest staying on the third floor so you can watch for your front door being damaged by any zombies. I store all the food in one cabinet (Chips, All food that can decay is stored in the fridge (Chicken, Fish, Steak, Carrots, Apples, and Bread) and also eat this before anything else.
Once you have enough supplies for a week (which you already should have) Check all 7 floors for all items. Usually you will find everything you need cooking, nails, hammers, weapons, gas cans, and lighters.
I like to keep the pot, shotgun (If you have one), axe, shotgun shells, a plank(to board up your place as soon as your done), and 4 bags of chips or something of the sort. Suggest going to the corner store or hitting the restaurant which may be tough to get to depending on how quick the horde is spawning in your game or where the horde is.
Only go out in the day time which starts a 7am. When leaving always close your door. If somehow a horde does find there way to your front door my final days plan is to create all the barricades I can leaving maybe 10 planks left for just in case I survive the upcoming onslaught. You barricade the staircases as much as possible and live out your days until you are low on food (in which case you gotta break down your barricades and face the music) or the zombies horde breaks down all of your barricades and its fighting time.

1) One starting location.
Starting in the same exact spot every single time, etc makes the game extremely monotonous. It's easy to get bored/frustrated after dying a couple times and to just shut the game off. Not to compare, but I really love how Minecraft spawns you in a randomly generated world every single time you start a new game. 

2) The fact that you WILL die. 
I know it seems like a great idea and very unique, the game will eventually make it impossible for you to survive. Why is this? Why is there not the potential for you to band together with your fellow survivors and continue to survive?

Mainly because you barely have to eat anymore and weapons just don't seem to break. Plus considering you start in an abandoned house with a baseball bat every time finding a decent weapon isn't even a challenge anymore

I last on average 10 days before I get bored

Admittedly the Zeds do seem harder to kill now - or at least random, get food and get out quick, the alarms actually take the zombies away from your initial base.

Finally the moodlets don't seem to effect anything

Firstly

We'll release to the community forums and update it until we fix the Intel bug
We'll update Desura at that point
We'll work on Kate and Baldspot getting that done
Then we'll go on Steam as soon as they are reimplemented and NPCs are back in

**Back with that release the game had atmosphere;**

* Original and very good moody dark music.
* Dark story that was unfortunately unfinished but I was hooked immediately and wanted more.

I was satisfied with my purchase then but at the same time disappointed because the story didn't go as far as it should have. So with not much to do other than challenging myself with seeing how far I could get I stopped playing the game and decided to wait a while and let it develop some.

Today I picked the game up again and downloaded 0.2.0r RC2.5 with expectations that in almost the year that I last played it some progress had been made.

Guess what? No really meaningful progress has been made. In fact

How has PZ devolved over the last year? I'll tell you.

* The music for the game has been completely ripped out. I couldn't find a reason for this on the forums other than vague bullshit. 
* Story mode was taken out for some reason or another. All that's left is a sandbox mode. A sandbox mode that was available in 0.1.5d.
* With story mode ripped out
* The game is now infested with a ton of bugs. Using a stove or a microwave is now dodgy as you got to click a few times to get the On/Off text to be fully visible and clickable.
* The game takes A LOT longer to load now. It's not my PC either

The summary of all this is the game I had bought a year ago and hoped that would progress some over the course of a year is now but a mere shell of its formerself. And I'm not sure if it's going to get any better for this game. All I see are promises and excuses. With the train wreck that is the past year of updates for this game in mind
