We've had some savings

Our first VN, with maybe a tiny buffer. Between [some production trouble](http://moacube.com/blog/cinders-postmortem-2-production-and-business/) and our own perfectionism, it took a year and a half.

We've had to stretch *really* thin to make it. I still remember having to decide between paying the rent and the electricity bill, it's just a funny story I tell to my friends when we go out for a beer. But back then -- holy shit was I stressed!

Still

It wasn't a huge hit or anything

It's been a year since the release now, the future ahead looks quite bright :).

So

I hope that our story will serve as an inspiration for some of you. Becoming a full-time indie developer is hard as hell, you can always get back to your old life. But you will hate yourself forever if you don't even try :).

I would also like to voice my thanks to the visual novel community. At first, open to trying out something new, and willing to share their knowledge and feedback. In fact, I don't think I've ever met a gaming community as friendly as this one in my seven years of game development.

1364901142.0,1bibnq,Custom patch for Fate/stay night which changes in-game BGM to the one from the recent reproduction,Polifem,46,1,17,"Hey guys

I made a custom patch for FSN which changes the in-game BGM to the soundtrack reproduction released late last year ( http://www.aniplex.co.jp/staynight/ ). It's essentially the same but its arrangement is better. Made it mostly for myself so I can re-read the novel with a slightly different feel to it


You can download the patch here: 

[MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/#!q55wULAJ!AtIL2SH5GUl04d2vThsKwlXy5cpHSWrwAK5VDXH668k)

[RAR archive for checking the integrity](https://mega.co.nz/#!zoRmCLzA!dJNea2Dh3tZ5ZZP39KVrynl-QmFhFmT5UljWeL4wsYY)

I understand file-sharing services are bad


Simply place the file into your FSN root directory and it should work. I tested the patch with the latest Realta Nua patch (4.2) and latest mirror-moon translation patch (3.2 I think. All these patches are so confusing lol). If you don't like it


Known issue: seems like there is a problem with the in-game vorbis decoder, I'm not that savvy with all the technical stuff, but this problem is not hugely impactful anyway.


I am also not really knowledgeable about the legal stuff, well, I share something released on a CD. Download and use it at your own risk.

1336299557.0,t9jwj,Would there be any interest in a Reddit VN Book Club?,uguublog,38,5,18,"I remember reading translated VNs two years ago



And now that there's enough of a community to merit a subreddit


Here's how I see it working. We select a VN to read by vote. We all read or reread it as a group. There's a weekly discussion thread


If we're reading as a group


Thoughts?


**EDIT**: It appears that there are four main concerns:

- Enforced playing order kinda sucks
- People need enough time to read
- The VN we ultimately pick shouldn't be too long
- Discussing one VN for too long will disinterest fast readers


For the first point: why don't we pick a linear VN to start out with? That gets rid of the first problem

For the second and fourth points: whoever is 'running the discussion' should have read the VN once before and figure out how best divide the VN into reasonable lengths for discussion. I think frequent threads will keep people's interest longer. Biweekly might be a good compromise between frequency and giving people a chance to catch up. Some VNs are naturally very episodic


The third point: I agree completely. Even though I love CLANNAD to death.


I propose we choose from the following. If we ever get around to actually doing this


[**Sekien no Inganock**](http://vndb.org/v417)   (fantasy)


[**True Remembrance**](http://vndb.org/v103)  (magical realism

1344109603.0,xol47,Your Top 5 Visual Novels,Aoiishi,36,6,68,"There are THOUSANDS of visual novels available in the world and I've only played a really small fraction of them


To start it off


**Fifth**: Utawarerumono - I played this game a while after I watched the anime and sadly, to be vague lol. The drawing was amazing and the character sprites were also great. The battle system that was incorporated was also a great addition that added to the fun. The graphics were great, but I wish that the story was not linear. If only it branched at places to give more variety... but oh well. It was good despite that. Get it if you want some fun with a great story and you don't mind it being a linear story.


**Fourth**: Sengoku Rance - Rance is actually a big series by AliceSoft. Sengoku Rance is the 7th game in the Rance series if you don't count the what-if game Kichikuō Rance or the side games with the fourth Rance game. This game is amazing both in its system and its story. You're basically a foreigner that gets control of one territory in Japan and try to take over all of Japan. I love this game because it has a good amount of comedy and ero in it with battles. I involves a lot of strategy because there are many territories that you must deal with. The battle system is simple to understand, the drawing is amazing, the sprites are amazing, the scenario is great, and the music is also great. Although there is basically one general story that ends up coming to pass, anything can happen along the way through the story. I love that it's so varied and requires thinking rather than just clicking, like some battle systems are (ex. Koihime Musou battles


**Third**: Clannad - For some reason


**Second**: Muv-Luv Series - I started this visual novel because people kept saying how great it was, Muv-Luv wasn't that AMAZING. It was just another high school drama type visual novel that has a few heroines to choose from etc. One thing I can say about it is that the stories for each of the heroines were actually pretty good. I felt drawn in to the story. I finished it giving it a thumbs up despite the typical high school scenario and moved on to Muv-Luv Unlimited. Now to tell you the truth, I read some of the Unlimited and Alternative manga, so I knew the gist of what this was about. Muv-Luv Unlimited turned out to be very good. It was well written had a good story and brought a lot of excitement. I only read some of the manga so up to a point, I knew what was going on, then everything from then on was a great surprise. The story was set well, but the thing that brought it down for me was the branched endings. The fact that you could go for different heroines at the end just seemed too hastily put together. All you have to do is change the person you think about at a point already close to the end and you get their ending. And each of their endings are the same. It makes it sorta disappointing to have those branches only for them to be the same stuff. The original Muv-Luv did better on that point than Unlimited did imo. Once I finished that, the one that everyone was going crazy about. When I started it and watched the opening to the start menu, I couldn't stop. I ended Unlimited at 3am. I started Alternative and played from 3am to the 6am of the next day. I had been awake for 44 hours. My eyes and head hurt, all the demons he's had to conquer


After talking about all that


**First**: Fate/Stay Night - This was the third visual novel I played after Brass Restoration and Farland Symphony. I was just starting out and found this beauty. This is what made me so passionate about visual novels. The stories were amazing. When I finished the Fate route, the drawing was great as well. I loved the expressions that the characters would have and the character sprites themselves. Is it weird that I focused on the fingers when I think of the art? I just love the way their fingers look in this game... yeah I know I'm weird. I can't tell you how many times I've played all the routes over and over again because I just can't get enough of it's story. I played it again recently when I got the Realta Nua version with extra CGs and voice overs. I was so happy and it made it a new experience again to play. I loved that atmosphere that the visual novel made. In each of the routes, you can see how much the characters struggle with themselves and each other. The characters are flushed out well which adds to how much I like this game. This game was the game that brought me into the world of visual novels, has amazing replay value because the story is just great, and has a special place in my heart. GET IT. Especially the Realta Nua version because I love the voice acting for it.",,False,t5_2r5yf,True

We currently have our own subreddit! If it's something you'd be interested in, you'll be privy to early info and sneak peaks (character concept art, music samples, etc.).

And, I know, I know. Macs. But hindsight is 20/20). As a result, we're shooting to release the game on both Mac and PC. So we're showing the Mac users some love.

Anyways, because truly, we're doing it for you!",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1272rz/remember_us_were_making_a_free_vn_for_you_still/

I just finished Umineko no Naku Koro ni, or Ramayana is in the epic genre. It is a tale of love, of human value, of cunning deception, and of the protagonist struggle against a cruel god; heck, it even technically begins in medias res, contains a praepositio and features a journey to the land of the dead. The only major difference, is that a) Umineko is also in the Murder Mystery genre

What do I mean by that? Well, takes you for a ride; a trip in a convertible speeding down the pacific coast high-way. Having a good protagonist is like having Michael Schumacher himself drive for you - every curve, every straight, every climb and fall is orgasmic. Taking a ride down the Umineko highway, however, is slightly different: here Schumacher gets in the passenger seat, prepares a highway map in case you get lost

There's a serial murder on the island of Rokkenjima, the reader, and Ryukishi07 the author. The protagonist exist as a vessel for your thoughts, and together you'll face waves of uncanny scenario, analyzing the situation and possibly learning a few logical deduction technique along the way.

Umineko was originally conceived as a sound novel, there is a patch which redoes the graphics and adds voice acting - and I promise you these are some of the best voice acting in the industry. The cast of characters are extremely lovable, but takes a backseat because this ride isn't really about them; it's about you!

You can get Umineko patched in English by checking out [Witch-hunt's](http://witch-hunt.com/) website. You can get the ps3 graphics tweak/voice acting from [Umineko tweak](http://uminekofix.wikia.com/wiki/Tweaking_Umineko_Wiki). I highly recommend you check it out even IF you've seen the anime. You will not be disappointed.

For a long time,  I'm sure you'll agree.

Favorite scenes or lines from the VN?

I'll start with my favorite line from Planetarian:

*""The thing that was broken... was not me... but... ""*

*Her eyes of optic resin reflected the world around her.*

I love how the writers completed Revvie's sentence without her having to say anything.

So without further ado:

**[""What do you think about the Planetarium...?""](http://i.imgur.com/8Le2d.jpg)**

Edit 1: Copied text from Uguublog's post below.

From [vndb](http://vndb.org/v34):

""""An uninhabited, you meet a young woman whose name is Reverie. A member of the planetarium’s help staff who continued to wait for customers for thirty years.""
Now don't get me wrong - I love Key. I think Clannad is better than bread. I fought all three of those stupid shadow creatures in Little Busters. When Rewrite gets translated
Notice anything common about those VNs? They're all disgustingly long - over forty hours long. And, a single idea. That's what I've always liked about Key VN's. Aside from all the silly dating sim business, there's always an underlying idea that drives everything else. They're not just stories about chasing after high-school girls - they aspire to be more than that ( - although, they're sure as hell about high-school girls, don't get me wrong).

So, emotionally naive girl, and she needs your protection. Even though Key compulsively indulges in the moe stereotype, their characters usually given the chance to rise above their helplessness to develop and grow. Nagisa [goes from being utterly fragile to being very self-sufficient](/s ""goes from being utterly fragile to being very self-sufficient""), as does Rin (and the main protagonist of Kanon too, if I recall).

It's not like Planetarian doesn't give Reverie a backstory - but she has such a one-dimensional inorganic constancy that I never really buy into her as someone I want to care about. She's a very transparent character. Very likeable. Very predictable and uninteresting. The result? The last few moments ends up seeming melodramatic for no good reason at all.

But

Mind you - there's a plethora of things that Planetarian does right. The world itself is quite convincing, we get the most character development and internal struggle - although I think it comes too late in the story for it to make any difference.

It added some serious depth to her character. The notion that she was pretty caring had been out in the open for a bit with the whole mother aspect

So, why include it? I can't think of a person who actually came out of KS remembering it for the porn experience, and we're talking about a game that people talk about rather candidly if r/KS is any indication. So even though it may have technically failed as porn, why would that need the draw in the first place? Why not let the merits of the emotional appeal draw people instead and just cut the ero content?

Really, what could be censored? Saya No Uta certainly didn't pull any punches talking about Fumanori's twisted mind. CROSS+CHANNEL didn't try to lighten up any of the more negative effects of their environment and scenario. Likewise, Katawa Shoujo never plays down the notion that you have to learn to accept your own faults as much as those of others.

I think the aspects of the relationships become so much more believable and personal when the game isn't limited by the boundaries of what other people let the creators use. A good VN lets the world that it tries to portray come out in full swing without trying to cut any corners

And I love that. I fucking love it. VNs have created some of the most coherently amazing worlds from writing, and fate/Stay Night's grim take on just about everything and love of characters with absurd amounts of power would be possible if they had any fear to make them be any lighter or have any limits on how they can portray the negative aspects of the elements that make them up.

I would say, so that alone made me fine with most of them ([](/s ""lemons, naturally, being the PRIME EXAMPLE"")). But something like KiraKira, which were VERY much shoehorned in sometimes ([](/s ""take Sarina having sex in the middle of being sick, which was just silly"")), most of Nasu's H-scenes in Tsukihime and fate/Stay Night ([](/s ""Akiha's was definitely not the right way to make a brother/sister thing seem right""))... I can't help but skip over sometimes. An H-scene seriously there for more than just rewarding the player with porn needs to be about more than sex to be anything more than an H-scene. (If, that's something that's even possible when we're talking about a product that needs to sell. Naturally every H-scene would be integrated as well as it needed if developers were completely given free reign in a eroge,False,

I met with the lead programmer today, while the meeting was great, and he was relieved I was familiar with the genre, the examples of previous attempts he gave me were spartan: black text on a white background with blue hyperlinks for dialogue choices, in javascript. Not that I could do better--far from it--and he admitted it was less than what he was fully capable of, but it still took the wind out of my sails a bit. He mentioned his introduction to the concept of VNs were through games his daughter played on her DS. (I forget which ones.) He was excited over the possibility of mini-games as a gameplay feature.

I'm sure many of you are similar to me. It's all about the feels--the emotional connections we create with the characters' arcs. I haven't played many VNs, probably, anything Dischan will ever create. Making my way through *Stein's* right now as well.) I felt there would be a clash of visions if I didn't address my background.

So, directed him toward *Juniper's Knot*.

He was *very* enthusiastic about the potential of RenPy, and promised me he would play through it by the time we have our next meeting this coming Friday, along with the assistant programmer. At the end of the meeting, he asked if I could provide more examples like *Juniper's Knot*. In the moment, at a loss, I suggested *Dysfunctional Systems: Episode 1*, and told him I'd get back to him on it.

Earlier

This is a bit politically tricky.

So many VNs are complex in this way. It's the reason I can't recommend *Shoujo* or *Cradle Song* to friends, even if I personally use and prefer their optional SFW experience.

**The Point:** I need a list of the best games, conservative seeming, father and professional to the potential of VNs as a medium. *Juniper's Knot* and the recent *Dysfunctional Systems* are good examples of what I need, but they were all I could think of.

Even though I appreciate the suggestions on the side bar, especially considering how gray the definition of the word erotic is to different people, and how little I know of the genre compared to most of you.

1356829118.0,15neqk,I finished the heroine routes of Rewrite today. Here is my spoiler free review. ,mamoranai,23,4,28,"Since the common route is longer than any of the heroine routes, I don’t believe there would be as many people complaining that the trilogy began slowly. The only part I can fault the common route for is that the beginning is somewhat dry. You’ll have to wade through several weeks of Kotarou’s life before the characters all come together.


The common route is also filled with a great deal of foreshadowing and supernatural occurrences. The foreshadowing is sometimes subtle and other times obvious. There are many times that an experienced reader can pick up on the hints the writers of Rewrite are leaving, I was satisfied with the answers given, and all plot points did stem for the same place. These rare delves into the supernatural might frustrate some impatient readers who wish that the story would move to the bigger picture it keeps teasing at. However, my advice would be to enjoy the common route for what it is because the heroine routes are filled with all you want and more. 


The common route does take on a much more serious tone towards the end, but it was forgivable since she had, in my opinion, one of the best routes. All the additional scenes provide even more foreshadowing and set up the reader for what is to come. 


I should comment on the interactivity of Rewrite as well. During the Mappie segments, I enjoyed the small amount of interactivity. Rewrite also has a number of decisions to be made, but the outcome of all is quite obvious. A bad end can be reached in the common route, but I have hard time thinking that many people will reach it unintentionally. 


Overall: 8.5/10

Kotori 

The creators of Rewrite should have enforced that Kotori’s route be played first. Kotori’s route is full of terminology and mythos that you will be seeing in the rest of the heroine routes, and it remains one of my favorite endings. I’ve seen the story told in this route described as “barren”, but I found the emptiness it instilled to be captivating. I can’t say much about this route without spoiling anything, so I’ll leave it at that.

Overall: 9/10 

Chihaya

Chihaya’s route is filled with shounen tropes. While I don’t find that to be bad in and of itself, this could have been avoided, but there weren't enough CG events to fill in the gaps of the vague descriptions. 


The route does have its good points, which is missing from most routes. There were a few scenes in particular that I did find moving. Despite its faults, I never found Chihaya’s route boring. In my opinion, if something entertains you, it can at least be considered good. Therefore, Chihaya’s route was enjoyable, but it didn't grow into anything spectacular. 

Overall: 7/10

Lucia

I must point out that this was the route written by Ryukishi07. Allow me to use this time to talk about what an incredible writer the man is. If Umineko had been trimmed of its fat, Lucia’s route is everything that you should love about Ryukishi07. The man has a brilliant way of spending time on a subject that seems irrelevant at first and then making you feel like a fool for not realizing its significance sooner. If you have read Umineko, you’re aware of how talented Ryukishi07 is at writing moving romance. To my surprise, Lucia’s route was the most romantic. The deep investment you will have in Kotarou’s and Lucia’s relationship is enough to make this route great, but it also contains a well-crafted plot that only the twisted mind of Ryukishi07 could conjure up. 

The story of Lucia’s route stands alone from the rest of Rewrite. It has significance and intriguing world building, this is one of the two best routes, but something in me wants to rate it little lower than Kotori’s and Akane’s. At the same time, I don’t want to understate how incredible it is. 

Overall: 8.5

Shizuru

Some people find an amazing ending to change their impressions of a story. Once you know what a story is working towards, this is one of the few times that the ending has altered my initial thoughts. I still can’t bring myself to call Shizuru’s route amazing, but this could be due to my personal preferences. I do like Shizru, but she’s my least favorite heroine in Rewrite, and Kotarou is the least heroic in this route. The beginning and latter half impressed me, but the middle was missing any exciting sequences. 

Shizuru’s route has a lot of crossover with Chihaya’s. They both add more impact to each other

Overall: 7.5/10

Akane 

This is the absolute pinnacle of Rewrite’s storytelling. From beginning to end, the writing is mind-blowing. Like Chihaya’s, Akane’s route could have benefited from better production, but it’s hard to fault even that. Akane’s (arguably Kotarou’s) story is moved well enough with words. This lends credit to how strong a writer Tanaka Romeo is. After finishing all the heroine routes, I’m tempted to read everything translated by the author because what he wrote in Rewrite impressed me to such a great extent.

**Fate/Stay Night**

**G-Senjou no Maou**  
The VN remixes classical music to use as most of its soundtrack. The piece I like the second most is [Nigeba Nashi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-EUknpIxw). I listened to the [original piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7GftdLYSsI) - this one is 100% faster or so. [Sayounara](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V77PC5XzdY) is my favourite piece

**Umineko**  
Pretty much every long piece by ZTS is good, [corruption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ97g2SMY7c) is a piece that sounds a bit like a ZTS but actually isn't (apparently by -45?).

**Hoshizora no memoria**  
The [ending song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j-3YthFlGk) is great (also comes in instrumental and [music box](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcQB3l20724) versions)

Then I hit refrain. 

Every other VN I've played has been blown out of the water. This is probably the most thought-provoking and amazingly surreal story-line I've ever heard. I cannot believe how this turned out. I started to play the game because I saw the anime and heard the game mentioned. 

I never expected that. 

I cannot, I had heard nothing of the story beforehand, save the bits the anime has covered so far. No one ever alluded to what an experience it would be. 

Although now the VN I've been working at for a couple of months is gone. I need some new ideas. What other VN can I use to occupy my time? I doubt there can be another quite like Little Busters!

I tend to like romance, to name two.

Now to proper guide:  
Installation:  
1. Install ATLASv14. Apply provided patch.  
~~2. Extract TA
~~3. Extract replacement script for TA helper to the same directory (overwrite if needed).~~  
3. Extract my complete package.  
4. Install Apploc (optional)  
5. Change your unicode enviroment to Japanese (optional).  
Usage guide:  
1. Run TA
2. Make sure your TAhelper screen looks like [this](http://imgur.com/DYtRx) (turn your attention to the circled things).  
3. Now run the game you want (if you can't run the game then run it through Apploc
4. Go to ITH  
5. Choose process tab. Then choose the game exe on the left and click attach.  
6. ITH will inform you on hooking up to the game.  
7. Go to the game and when text appears; ITH will find that text address.  
8. You must then choose the proper text hook (the one that matches your screen content) by clicking on that bar above the console (at start is says: 0000:0000.......:ConsoleOutput &lt;-click this).  
9. Now when going through the game ITH will send the text to TAhelper and then the output will appear on TA screen.  
10 (optional). You can use devOSD to make a transparent overlay on your game.  

Using custom hook codes with ITH:  
1. When you choose the game in process tab and attach to it use ""add profile"" button.  
2. The game should appear in ""profiles"" tab.  
3. Add custom hook to the user hook space. Click SAVE.  
4. Restart the game. ITH should autohook to it. Choose UserHook on ITH main window and translated text should appear on the TA window.  

That's it. Feel free to ask any questions. I'll add more images later

	I’d like to introduce all of you to The Human Re-Ignition Project.

-------------------------------------

Thanks to technology, sending letters, talking to friends, and work. All of these can now be done from anywhere in the world. There is no longer any need to go anywhere, meet anyone, or do anything sociable, and somewhere along the line these activities faded away. Gradually, the human spirit decayed.
This in turn made socializing the sort of thing that only happens on television and in movies. The minority left wanting to return to life as it was before stubbornly blame various leaps in technology, slowly and steadily. No one saw it happening, and if they did, they likely didn't care.
And thus is the setting for our story. Herein lies a tale about friendship, and possibly insane Professor's leadership to bring color back into the dead world. It's a story about how technology quelled the flames of the human heart – and how the hard work and passion of a few will re-ignite it. 

-------------------------------------

If you’re interested in the project, Mac, and Linux.

Booted up the game and played for the grand number of about 30 minutes

I mostly find reading e-mails and letters in games boring because they are about random people you never meet and rarely care about. So if most of the game consists of that

**So my question is: Should I soldier through it? Does the game/story pick up and become more interesting as it goes along. Is it worth getting past the boring introduction?**

It takes a very long time to read through all 3 series. However, even though I did get tired from time to time, I was able to appreciate all the thoughts that went into every little things from geography to TSF's control to combat tactics. To not be outdone by background details, character developments were also very refined. I could understand and appreciate the convictions of even the low class soldiers. The main characters were all built off of the previous games, making their personalities that much deeper and more powerful. All the tragedies in the game really got to me; every deaths were meaningful and powerful because they were all reflected through the main character's attitude. I must say that telling the story through Takeru's first person view was a very effective way. His understandings, emotions, and perceptions of those around him really helped me become part of the story. Through Takeru

Everything was explained pretty well at the end and I'm glad for that. And of course, [](/s ""a bittersweet ending. It is pretty sad that Takeru does not remember anything, nor does anyone in MLA world remembers him."") Kasumi is the only thing that was left to interpretation but I think it was more like they wanted us to play Muv Luv Altered Fable. And damn right I will when the patch comes out.

This was an emotional roller coaster. If you're looking to immerse yourself not just in a game but in a universe, and mourning is okay but continue to move forward in the face of tragedies. There's a lot more but now I'm just preaching. Ah well, go play the game!

3. Nothing too short either - Planetarian was nice and all

4. Something that can be easily broken into smaller parts would be nice. Highly episodic VNs or something already broken up into smaller chapters would be preferable.

1375380088.0,1jibhy,Grisaia no Kaijutsu- Amane route Discussion [spoilers],Vladz0r,15,3,29,"Hey guys. I figure a lot of people here may have started with Yumiko's or Makina's route based on the guides and information that was around

What did you guys think about it? Were any feels had at the ending?

I personally thought it was alright. My friend was hyping it to infinity

Main issue: The backstory and its purpose. I don't see the point of a 6 hour backstory to illustrate regret and blame belonging Amane. I thought the backstory was pretty good for the most part, we were told Amane was the only survivor.

In terms of the development, but I kind of wanted to see something more interesting with Amane. The necksucking part was admittedly pretty lewd and awesome.

The romance between Yuuji and Amane was fun and upbeat. The other heroines from the main route and the sillyness of it all made it pretty enjoyable to read. Yuuji decided to, and continued to love her despite that. 

I kind of didn't like the whole situation with Sakashita's father hunting for revenge

The ending seemed a bit bittersweet. I would've enjoyed something without too far ahead of a timeskip, although I would've liked it to have ended off earlier, rather than skipping ahead all this time to try to give us some sort of heartrending moment with a newly contrived granddaughter. Overall, I think I just found Amane's blame from the backstory to be so ridiculous because of how we clearly knew it wasn't her fault. I didn't really  get emotional from her regret, and her past suffering didn't seem to negatively affect her throughout her route and the common route, aside from of course Sakashita's fated appearance.

I think my expectations were that of a nakige, I had some fundamental issues with how the story developed. It was a fine story, ~8-8.5/10 I'd say, although the slow story development and narrow scope of the events kind of disappointed me. The common route seemed to have some relative variety, but only a few drawn-out events seemed to happen in Amane's route. The writing, however, was excellent throughout. The writer of the Common Route and Amane's route is pretty competent at writing believable environmental details and witty characters (Yuuji and Kazami).

So what did you think about this route?

Katawa Shoujo was the one I kind of got suckered into by a few friends. I didn't know about the genre, it really hit me hard, and probably will always be my favorite.

After that, and Nekoko's path was alright in my book.

Kira Kira was next, and I was really satisfied with the overall story and all of the paths. 

Right now I'm about halfway through CLANNAD, as this has been a pretty positively-reviewed game. However, I'm not getting hit too hard in the feels, and the story has been alright, but with so many paths, it doesn't feel like something as central to the rest. I'm going to still finish it properly, though. I feel like I just need to play more for things to pick up.

_____________________________________________________

So thats it. Thats all the VN that i put in my bookmark list. Which one should i play? Which one should i add to this list or remove?

Also
___________________________________________________

Clannad and Little Busters!: Those were just great. I mean, never stop please. Also, the anime version of Clannad is surprisingly great. Not the same thing can be said about Little Busters! anime.

Ever 17: Man

G-senjou no Maou and Sharin no Kuni, i completed both. I mean, i figured some of the stuff on my own but the story lies or mislead you on purpose to create a greater sense of tension or something and i think that shows that the writing is not so good. But then again, thats just my opinion, some people like that kind of stuff. Even me, i admit i completed both and i had fun doing so but it happened too many times that i was angry because something that was known by the protagonist was left aside to surprise the reader. Whats the point of viewing everything from the perspective of the protagonist then? I just dont get it.

Hoshizora no Memoria: I loved it except for the end. The characters were interesting but the true end was bad in my opinion. I just didnt like the girl. I wanted the guy to meet her again but when it happened

Katawa Shoujo: Simple yet great. Of all the routes, perfect for first timers.

Kira☆Kira: Simple. Nothing special. But still manages to make me feel bad. Nothing to say about this one except its fun.

Muv-Luv: Who still hasnt completed Muv-Luv? I mean, you better put it in your list of ""Must do"".

Rewrite: I dont know what to think about this one. It was fun but it feels like the focus of the game wasnt put in the right direction. It feels like the story only needed 4 heroines but to balance that out they added Lucia which is kind of ironic because she was my favorite. Why I think they added her for balance is because all the other heroines's route are focus on other things than the relation between the protagonist and the said heroine. But not her route! And thats why i prefer her route. I mean, the guy just saved the entire world and what does he gets? He forgets everything about himself. He is transformed into a goddamn tree. He becomes a slave/servant. Some people might say thats not so bad because its the 5 heroines who get him but none of them remember him so whats the point? 3 of them knew him when they were kids and none of them remember him. Thats bullshit. Kotori wanted to be with him all the time or something and now she doesnt remember him. He saved Akane like twice or something and she doesnt remember him. Ok its true that she had some sort of mental illness if i remember correctly but it still pisses me off. And Shizuru only met him once but she is Shizuru and i though that her weird personality would actually allow her to remember him. But nope. So it doesnt feel like there is any accomplishment."") At least thats what i think. Also, Yoshino is my favorite character. Doesnt that tell a lot about the story? Isnt someone's favorite character suppose to be one of the heroine or maybe even the protagonist? Maybe that just me over-thinking things but thats how things are. Im so full of shit. Key is great but that wasnt one of there best in my opinion. Its still worth playing. I mean, this whole text is just about things that i dont like about it but there is also shit tone of good things that i didnt mention. Go play it.

Tomoyo After: That was awful. If you expect the ""After Story"" of Clannad but focused on Tomoyo instead of Nagisa well fuck you because thats not what you are gonna get. Im gonna spoil it all and wont hide it because its not worth it. Everything felt wrong to me when i play it. The beginning is just dumb. 5 weird h-scenes right of the bat. The new characters are annoying. Even Tomoyo felt annoying for me. The kid just pop out of nowhere and everybody is just like ""Yeah a new kid thats not mine so im gonna take care of her even though that means those responsible for her will just go away without a problem."" And she doesnt have anything going for her. She is just used for jokes, her strength and what not was used to make jokes and build her character but in this VN, it feels so forced. Also, what kind of end is that? At the end when the story finally gets to the point where Tomoya and Tomoyo have to get over a problem together (im talking about the [](/s ""memory lost"") thingy), it doesnt feel like it makes any sense. It just comes out of nowhere and it has nothing to do with any of the characters. Its just a problem the writers used because it could be used in any situation. Also, what kind of ending is that? I heard that in the true real end, Tomoya [](/s ""dies"") but in they changed it so he just [](/s ""lose the use of his body""). I dont understand how this is suppose to be a fulfilling end but meh

Yume Miru Kusuri: Its just full of wtf and for that its worth playing. Not much else to say.

I am wanting to play it to the full length and get all the good and bad endings. It will take a few weeks to do but I was curious how many endings there were total and can't quite seem to find the answer. All I am being told is that there are true endings

I guess my main question is, and Heaven's Feel) have good endings along with their bad endings, or will I have to live with bad endings for some without any compromise? 

It shouldn't be a problem

When I first started to play, so I started to enjoy this game on a whole new level. 

So I finished my first route, know that Riki just attends his first semester over and over again, like he is stuck in a loophole. In the beginning I had a feeling it was something like this, because after you were done with one route and started a new one, the player sometimes carried his experienced from the previous route into the new one, like faint memories and sudden bursts of emotions. I didn't pay too much attention to this at the beginning. I never had a feeling this game would turn into something really serious."")

[ ](/s ""When I started with Rin's route (After finishing all other ones.), because I noticed that Rin and Riki didn't know something that everybody knew. The game made a really good job at making the player feel hopeless and alone. Well, needles to say when you learn about the *secret of this world*, despair truly sets in. The ending was so heartbreaking, knowing that everybody died and Riki and Rin were the only ones that survived. Kyousuke and the rest did everything to make the two stronger so they could live happily after the accident. I seriously could not accept this. I couldn't control my gladness when I actually saw the real ending. After you finished the shitty one, the player gets to chose if he want to keep fighting on. Naturally I kept going on, saving everybody's asses. Well fuck that was insane. Seriously."")

The ending felt like ALL the good endings of all the routes, which one of the two visual novels did you like more? Oh and can somebody help me with this, it appears so that I only completed 55% of all the available CGs, after completing all the routes. I think this is quite strange, I'm not sure what I should do anymore. Also, I noticed that when I want to play the 3 new routes, everything is in gibberish

You are Sato Fuyuki, depending on what choices you've made, you'll be led into part two.

It took almost 9 hours to finish the common path. I also thought it was going to be a kinetic novel the way it didn't have a choice until about an hour into the game. 

I've only played 2 routes so far. Asuho and Isuza. 

I am anxious to find out more about the common path. I learned ""her"" name is [ ](/s ""Yume"") through Asuho's path and learned nothing else in Isuza's. Hopefully the other paths will delve into more of ""her"" story. I was thinking that Mare's path may shed light but I'm not so sure she even has a path. I did notice choices opened up for Chinami after I finishes Isuza's path so it may be that I have to play more routes. 

Anyways, and the game in general. 

As I've played only Asuho's and Isuza's routes

Asuho's was generally more enjoyable than Isuza's. Her personality was easier to handle and the secret about Asuho and why she always positions herself the way she does was pretty neat. I loved the few lines from Kosame about their [ ](/s ""encounter on the hill and how You was even cool and composed during the event""). 

As for the other girls. 

Chiname: I should hate her. I want to hate her. Everything I've learned from anime and visual novels screams at me to hate her. I love this girl more than any of the others however. I think it has to do mostly with Isuza's path but even before I fell into that path

Hisakaki sisters: I liked the [ ](/s ""confrontation"") with Kosame during the common path. I can't wait to play her path. Komomo doesn't really hit anything special with me but I am interested in more of the [ ](/s ""confrontation"") story to come out so I can't wait to play either of their paths. The whole yuri bit I could care less for and I'm hoping they don't play that out too much during the paths. 

Mare: like I've said earlier

The black haired ""on paper"" girl: Other than what happened at the end

Suzuha: I hope she doesn't have a route unless its a non-romantic option. I still love this girl to death though.

Well wasn't I surprised after finishing ""*999: Nine Hours, the plot was solid, the mystery was cool and I loved the decision making that led to multiple endings. MOAR, I said.

So I started researching *999* with the goal of finding more stuff like it. That's when I learned that it wasn't just an adventure game per se but also a Visual Novel. ""This isn't right"" I said to myself ""where is the batshit crazy plot and annoying fucks that could drive a hardcore buddhist monk to suicide?"" 

My research ended there, hur dur durp!"". Later we praised the TV on our knees for blessing us with the presence of such an awesome, well written and original story.

Thats when I said ""Thats it!"" and decided to try out another VN. I lurked around here and there

...

This is the part of the writing process when I stop typing for about fifteen minutes and remember the profound experience I had a couple of days ago called ""*Ever17*"". Never in my life had any medium invoke such a strong emotional response in me. I liked every single character, the revelations were mind blowing and the ending was satisfying. I laughed, I cried (""Fuck tissues! I need a towl""), I felt guilty for choosing one path and not the other (after one of Takeshi's endings I just couldn't stop thinking ""It's all my fault"" for some reason... weird huh? ;] ). 

It was simply and literally **awesome**.

Feeling a hunger for more I've picked up Chaos;Head next. It was made by the same guys that made Steins;Gate so I just had to try it out... and I don't know what to think of it. It was kind of disappointing but also unique... in a sadistic way. Reading through it was painful at some times

After all that I can say I'm no longer so bitter and hateful towards stuff that comes from Japan.

Sure, and maybe even read manga. But you're looking to making your own content!

If enough interest is expressed


People we need:

- Artists. People with experience drawing backgrounds or characters in the traditional anime style. Menu and window design is also desired.

- Programmers. Although the production is likely going to be via Ren'Py (the same engine used to program the well-known Katawa Shoujo)

- Musicians. Depending on the atmosphere the writers agree on, and performing it.

- Writers. Were you picked on in high school because you knew what auxiliary verbs were? Then we want you (and we promise not to pick on you)! Although everyone on the project will have some say as to the general storyline

My best friend and I are huge fans of Fate/ franchise and we used to talk over the series for hours. Lately, my fellow Redditors, feel about this theory.

The scene that I am refers to happenes at the 5^th day

After Shirou took Sakura to her room he went to Ryuudou temple and returned late at night

**My first evidence** to prove that this is Sakura's doing, thus he couldn't possibly be dreaming about them... unless the whole dream was caused by Rider and her Mystic Eyes.

**Second evidence** is in the very next scene where Shirou has a nightmer. He dreams about the fire from 10 years ago and [he sees something that wasn't suppose to be there](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#9). Again

**Third evidence** is the fact that at the morning Sakura seemed to be fine. She shouldn't be if she didn't replenish her prana. Shirou, unless Sakura used his semen to replenish her prana.

**And the last one**, so Sakura lies to him that she's there to take his temperature (He's not feeling well) and comes closer to him. When she gets too close he recalls the dream and stops her. When she asks why, we have a choice to lie or tell the truth. If we choose to tell her that Shirou had a dream she is excited and asks who was in that dream, and when Shirou confess to her that it was Rin, Sakura immediately leaves the room and is obviously pissed off.

1332686921.0,rcp3p,New Fantasy Visual Novel Project: Lux Iris. Looking for Recruits,MagicIris,12,4,23,"**Lux Iris Visual Novel Project**

Inspired by Katawa Shoujo, we could not bring it into fruition. With the release of Katawa Shoujo and other amateur VN projects, we are determined to see this project through to the end.

So, I've learned the basics of Ren'Py, a Python-based game engine commonly used to create VNs, and wrote one of several prologue chapters into it. I am currently using placeholder images for the backgrounds until a design choice is finalized.

Sample: http://forums.lux-iris.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=10

**The premise:**
The story is set in an original but generic fantasy world. It follows the adventures of several characters with radically different backgrounds who are part of an adventuring agency. An agency is a company whose employees take on dangerous jobs. While each has their own personal agenda

**Setting:** Hard Fantasy

**Genre:** Adventure

**Presentation:** Third-person view

**Engine:** Ren'Py

**Release:** The current plan is to release it for free. 

...

 
**The Team:**

**Writer:** Magic (Myself)

**Editor:** Ren (Story)

**Artist:** Aisolus (Colorist)

**Music Composer**: Walko [Sample: http://forums.lux-iris.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=9]

Right now, and who will do what. The first milestone will be completing the prologue chapters, which will also serve as the demo version. 
None of us have any experience with making VNs. We do not expect anyone who wants to join to have any. We can learn as we go. But what we do expect applicants to have a skill to bring to the table

**What we want:**

- Writers

- Artists (Background, colorists)

- Programmer (Python)

- Director

- PR/Marketer/Community Manager

I will be self-funding this project. I have a significant portion of my income that I can spare. So

1331949242.0,r09vg,Comic creator playing with visual novel ideas. ,jamesabels,10,2,4,"Hey reddit! 

I've been a semi accomplished comic colorist for the last 4 years, Image, IDW, ect. I've also really taken a shining to writing and recently released my first 5 page pitch issue of my creator owned book Android Panda (www.androidpanda.com)

Anyhow, so I have a deep love for the medium. Comics are creative powerhouses that have also served the same function to me and many other readers, though I come from games and would love to leave my mark there. 

I could never really grasp coding, though I can't offer much if any pay, and would feel bad expecting a team to work on a promise or a hope to get paid later. 

Interactive fiction is something I've been watching for a while, or even experienced, I'm just getting started with being a fan of the visual novel. Though I've been a student of telling stories, and producing music, and some art for a good half of a decade now. 

Anyhow, anime and eastern traditions, though it's just not where I come from, and not my style. 

I think my first foray into it would be with my already developing comic Android Panda. Not a  serious, Crime, Femme Fatal, and even some way more experimental ideas, like a Dear Esther or playing with a more psychological experience using audio, writing and color to provoke emotion. 

Just an idea at this point

1374480971.0,1isuhd,[Spoilers] Finished Danganronpa was a cool experience,stitchwithaglitch,11,2,11,"I started the visual novel after I saw the anime and just had to see what's was going to happen next

Anyways

The real thing I care about though besides the mysteries was the story of about the world where this set of events was actually happening. The mystery of the academy itself was something interesting because the main reason these children were put into the school to murder each other by Monobear's claim was DESPAIR. After the first anime episode

The cool thing about this novel for me was the fact that I could walk around the school and investigate it at the same time. Sure it isn't anything crazy revolutionary where I'm basically just moving my character and clicking on objects as the story is holding my hand throughout the novel guiding me

The next thing I want to remark on is the cast was pretty good. These are the type of characters that already have their defining feature and personality where they don't actually NEED to grow to be interesting. The game ignores that and still gives you the option to learn more about just them the basic, my favorites being Byakuya, Naegi, Kirigiri, and Asahina. The real cool thing was the actual antagonist. Monokuma was done really well, even though hes basically evil in the form of a bear, I just couldn't hate him. He's does all his actions in such a silly lovable way that everytime he popped up onto my screen

The next thing I wanted to remark on was the sense of danger and excitement I got from this novel. Visual Novels have made me feel a lot of different emotions when I read the, but exciting and even humorous as well. It's all so well done at setting a pace of things that it left me wanting so much more as the novel progressed. 

Next thing refers to the pace. The class trials that happen were basically interactive mini-games that allowed you to piece together all the clues you found in one exciting event. Everytime I found the lie in the non-stop debates I just went BOOM YOURE WRONG. Solving mysteries never felt as good as in a class trial. The games for the most part were pretty fun, even when Naegi wasn't the most targeted suspect in the debate, if you get a game over, each time Naegi is the one decided as the guilty party. It's kinda lazy on the makers side to not make a specific bad ending for each trial to keep consistency with the story.

Lastly, I wanted to say since I first saw that Kirigiri was titled, ""Super Duper ???"" I knew she was a super duper detective. It was one of the obvious things about the novel. The rest was pieced together rather quickly. I just needed three major hints. Information about the 16th student, a realistic idea about the what the world was like outside the school walls, and more concrete proof of the two  time skip happening with the characters having their memories erased. Anyways, I the main point was I thought the ending was done really REALLY well. Besides the fact that the game trolls us by throwing a kangaroo court class trial, they finished off pretty strong in terms of the FINAL class trial. All the pieces were put together really well, I still figured after I saw the clue that 2 of the students were traitors

[](/s ""In terms of the ending class trial and epilogue I thought they went really well except for some minor complaints. What was done well though was the class trial itself, and the use of hope to fight against it. The ending did bring in a lot of just unbelievable things to the table such as the great tragedy that ended the world which gave reason to why the Danganronpa events were happening and how why the students were stuck in this closed off school. They were really out there though, and only in a video game could it be made possible but still, they are really unbelievable in terms of circumstance. The information was still delivered well and felt shocking as despair seemed ever so likely to close in on me (This sense that an inevitable bad end looming over my head provided great tension). The way that Naegi ended up fighting back using hope in a non-stop debate was crazy awesome though and a GREAT idea by the game makers. Seeing everyone slowly gain the courage to look past despair and move on was something special. That shinning light to fight this terrible idea of despair that was being thrust down their throats by model girl was spectacular. Her execution was also something... indescribable. The only thing I didn't like was during the epilogue was when they're about to step out into the unknown world that was supposedly ended. WE DONT GET TO SEE THIS APOCALYPTIC WORLD. Instead we skip to the credits and I'm left sad and incomplete, would've liked a kiss or something with Kirigiri, that would've been awesome. I can only guess what it is without concrete proof from the story, and until I get my hands on more information concerning Danganronpa's sequel I can only be left in the dark until then. The other thing I wanted to mention that I didn't like was the fact that the world did somehow end with a super duper malefaction event. It's another one of those things where it just sounds too far out there to be a possible event even in fiction

[](/s The thing that will probably stick out to me the most from the ending was, courage or some other random crappy happy feeling that allows them to vanquish the evil, but most of the time its done poorly or as if you didn't even need to go through the trouble of doing it. Danganronpa allowed me to use hope in such a gratifying way that I didn't need to think this was some cliche, because it wasn't. They used hope in a very instrumental fashion to give the story's end in the fight against despair, and very fulfilling ending."")

TL;DR Danganronpa was an awesome visual novel experience. It brings so much intense excitement to the incredibly dark story through the gameplay

Anyway
I had some questions that I missed

So, Tsugumi is supposedly lured to LeMU by You(haru). She's told that she would be re-united with her children and whatnot. Did You(haru) let Tsugumi in on the plan, which was to fool the KID in 2034 into believing it was 2017 in order to bring forth Blink Winkel? I mean, Tsugumi knew she had a child with Takeshi, and that this guy suspiciously had the same name, and she was being trapped in the same LeMU from 17 years ago, so I assume she had to be 'in' on the plan.

My next question is about You(haru)'s incentives. I found this paragraph googling for Blink Winkel.

(Its hard to say who is the real mastermind though. Blick Winkel told You'haru the plan only because he knew about the plans from watching You'haru and Kaburaki carry it out in the year 2034. However, you might argue that the plan did not originate from anywhere, and it never needed to.)

I'm kind of confused
Here's what I thought:

Takeshi drowns and dies in 2017-&gt; You(haru) somehow comes up with the plan to awaken Blink Winkel and excutes that plan -&gt; Blink Winkel watches over everything in 2034 -&gt; Blink Winkel goes back to 2017 to wake up Takeshi at the ocean floor, because of a time paradox, and Takeshi turns to disgusting goop and Coco disappears when BW checks the results in 2034 -&gt; BW goes back to 2017, tells Coco and Takeshi to stay in the pods (for 17 years) and then goes back to 2034. Now we're at Hokuto's (Takeshi's son) perspective, and he dives down and saves Coco and Takeshi after they've been asleep for 17 years.

So I guess the main questions are...

What inspired You(haru) to awaken Blink Winkel

Why is Tsugumi going along with the plan from 2034?

I figure these are all the preserve the mystery in the visual novel anyway

On one hand the story was amazing of course, music, etc... were all exceptional, but I never found myself terribly moved by anything that happened. I didn't cry at all although there were some very sad moments. To put this in perspective, I bawled all through planetarian, and even Saya no Uta made me tear up at the end. I'm thinking maybe I didn't play it fast enough (I spread it out over about 2 weeks) and didn't get emotionally invested in the characters, but perhaps I just didn't care for them at all. I played through all the routes in Extra/Unlimited before hand though and found them reasonably enjoyable.

I also found the ending a bit disappointing, but I can't decide whether that's true or if I simply didn't connect to the characters. It definitely didn't feel like I had played over 50 hours of the game, I can't tell if it's just because I'm a fast reader, or because of how exciting it was. Oh yeah, the story was incredible and I constantly wanted to see what'd happen next, but in the end I think it relied too much on the drama of everybodies deaths to make a memorable ending instead of using the overall story to bring it to a better close. I wasn't really fazed by any of the deaths as I saw them all coming from miles away (lucky guesses some of them), so the ending just really didn't do it for me.

This is just my opinion of course, because although I really enjoyed the VN overall, all I can think of now is how the ending could've been better.

Just so you know, you are probably gonna see a lot of jumping from one subject to another. Its probably not gonna be that interesting either but go ahead and read it if it entertains you.

Now that's out of the way, i actually thought that that game would be the one that would get the most emotion out of me. Then i found out the VNDB and was quite surprise to see it wasnt on the first page when put by popularity or rating. Somewhere on a forum about KS, i saw a post that said something like: ""People that play KS and praise it too much and stop it there wont be able to appreciate any other VN."" That made me think about what i was doing. I actually was praising the game a lot too and was interested on trying some other VN but i didnt know where to where from that point on. Also i was pretty depressed so i thought about trying some VN with a lot of H-Scene just to change my mind. Something less serious probably wouldnt hurt.
Thats when i found 3 other VN that i tried. 1 was about Human pet or something. I liked it but for all the wrong reasons. Lets say that i was laughing at the game instead of with it. It was pretty shitty. The second one was Yume Miru Kusuri (A drug that makes you dream) and i actually had fun with it. For some reason i didnt like it as much as i thought i would. Probably too much sex bullshit which is kind of ironic because that's what i was looking for in the first place. It isnt bad but not the best in my opinion. Then it was Monster Girl Quest's turn. Holy crap thats good. I cant wait for the last part. Sometimes you find the best things where you less expect it. Now that i talked about my whole experience with VNs for some stupid reason

Now the spoilers are gonna come from everywhere (probably... i dont know

I dont remember why i tried this game in the first place but holy crap it was so worth all the time spent on this game. I am just remembering every little details that i didnt really cared about at first and i finally realize how much details there is. When I started reading, that it was just a way for the devs to make the players enjoy the game as much as possible before the big end. Simple stuff.

In my head it was just a way to give a little sense of progression to the player so the prologue wouldnt be always the same. But the parts about the text that change a little bit and the routes that get blocked when completed picked my curiosity. Dont get me wrong, i wasnt thinking the game had a whole plot hiding behind it and what not. Again, i thought it was just a choice by the devs the make the game less... repetitive i guess. I got to admit, now that i think about it, i wish every character routes would have been a little longer. I dont know why that it, i mean they are all great and complete (Execept maybe for Kurugaya's route which bugs me. I'm not sure i get the end. If someone could explain it and help me confirm my theory

Now comes Refrain. I just dont know how to talk about it. It was just so... Great. There is so much suspense. How did they manage to do this? They kept talking about how Riki had to become stronger but i didnt know why or wtf was going on. I think thats the right expression for the situation ""wtf is going on"". The childhood friends then gets their own little routes and some events are explain. I cried so much during these parts. If only i knew where it was going.

The moment things begin to become clear... I dont know how to describe it. It was so powerful. I mean

If you are still reading this post

Now, i think its quite interesting. They try hard to make it feel like the VN itself, they use the music and the ideas like the battles thingy from the game which is really nice. I wonder if Key as a lot of power over the anime or if the name of the company is just put in the credits because they own it. I just think that its a bad idea to make a anime out of the VN to start with. Why? Because they cant get the same feeling or atmosphere or whatever. Its too rushed, things happen too fast and the characters arent as interesting because they are not developed enough. I guess its a different situation for those who actually finished the game. I wonder if there is many people that watch the anime who didnt play the VN. Its cool that they try to include every little event in it too but it doesnt feel right sometimes. Maybe its because some characters dont have the same voice and its really bugging me. Anyway, i actually enjoy watching it even though they cant give the viewers the feeling of restarting a new game and making the beginning different each time because there is only one beginning. Im really curious how the end is gonna be show. Are they rushing everything now so they can focus on the poignant ending? I hope so. If not, where are they gonna stop? With Riki and Rin in the hospital? I hope not.

Anyway

Lets just say that I am now a fan of Key even though i havent play any of their others VN (yet)

So it's been a week

There were great things about it, the poorly set up sex scenes were definitely disappointing. I'm not one of those guys who can't appreciate a good sex scene in a story, but I AM one of those guys who hates ""unnecessary"" sex scenes that are just there for the ""fan service"". This didn't quite go that far, but it did get to the ""uncomfortably stupid"" kind of feeling. To cite Crime And Punishment again: There's no (obvious) sex in the book, however if there was it wouldn't have happened at least until what is the ""epilogue"" in the VN. Another thing that bugged me was that I couldn't fall in love with the characters like I always want to in a good VN. The protag. was too much of an asshole, even compared to the book... and the girls were a bit too ""typical VN heroin""-ish. (You know, the goof ball, and the shy one? We've all seen it before.)

Anyway

**Here's the real reason I posted this**:

I always really want to fall in love with the characters in a VN... (since in this medium it creates character-reader bonds that can't be had in books or movies.) and my biggest let down was that it didn't get a really strong emotional reaction out of me. I'm one of those psychos who like a story to tear out my heart and bring me to tears. haha

It's hard to miss that they have an obsession with it. The oldest heroine which is in her 20's is the youngest looking sprite. The most non-loli heroine

As for the game, you have to start a new game rather than loading a save if you want to hit their paths after they are unlocked. 

Opinion part. 4 really good paths. Asahi, and Rin. The rest were mildly entertaining at best. The translation is top notch. Haven't looked if it's a professional or fan translation but it seemed perfect. The character design is awkward at first because it's so different but when I got used to it, I really fell in love with it. 

The H scenes aren't exactly necessary but I felt a few of them added to the story plus they have a bit of dialogue during them. Not important dialogue but interesting dialogue that adds to the path you're on so it was hard for me to skip through all the ""Nggg agh ooh oh yeah Mitsuki"" stuff. 

The protagonist is your average school kid. Boring through most of the game but he still has his good moments where it's meant to convey empathy for him worked to a degree so it wasn't hard to feel like you are him in most instances. The comic relief best friend wasn't dull. Reminded me of Sunohara (Clannad) Watashi (?)(Da Capo 2).

Notice anything common about those VNs? They're all disgustingly long - over forty hours long. And, a single idea. That's what I've always liked about Key VN's. Aside from all the silly dating sim business, there's always an underlying idea that drives everything else. They're not *just* stories about chasing after high-school girls - they aspire to be more than that ( - although, they're sure as hell about high-school girls, don't get me wrong).


So, emotionally naive girl, and she needs your protection. Even though Key compulsively indulges in the moe stereotype, their characters usually given the chance to rise above their helplessness to develop and grow. Nagisa [ ](/s ""goes from being utterly fragile to being very self-sufficient""), as does Rin (and the main protagonist of Kanon too, if I recall).


It's not like Planetarian doesn't give Reverie a backstory - but she has such a one-dimensional inorganic constancy that I never really buy into her as someone I want to care about. She's a very transparent character. Very likeable. Very predictable and uninteresting. The result? The last few moments ends up seeming melodramatic for no good reason at all.

But


Mind you - there's a plethora of things that Planetarian does right. The world itself is quite convincing, we get the most character development and internal struggle - although I think it comes too late in the story for it to make any difference.

I mostly liked the characters (hell, and the general plot; it's just that the tone and atmosphere of it get so dreadfully depressing. And not just depressing, but it also bores the hell out of me when it goes into those 20+ page long internal monologues.

I'm not saying this is really its fault... mostly. Maybe it could have presented the themes and ideas it was going for in a way that didn't kill my mood so much. But that's more of a gripe than a real complaint. Objectively

1372493988.0,1haw4w,Unlimited is done! My thoughts...,Actawesome,9,1,15,"So, though I might be feeling a little Stockholm syndrome from spending so much time with these characters.

Let me address the high and low parts of the story. My favorite was the Cumulative Combat exam on the island. Some other notable parts were the very beginning, which was Meiya's for me. Of course this time I pretty much skipped the H scene, seeing as I knew it had little reference to anything else and I wanted to fap to something else. I liked that she had Takeru's kid, though I sort of wondered how she didn't get preggers when they did it the first time. Oh well. The lowest scenes for me was when Tama shot the missle from the roof. I don't know, that whole speech Takeru gave, the scene itself, everything just seemed kind of cliché. For some reason I found myself cringing a bit during that part. I liked the little game guy arc (it happened with Meiya) but it strikes me weird how Yuuko didn't just take it away when he was in the detention barracks.

What I did like is that the main character didn't start battling the BETA right away like this was some sort of Evangelion or Gurren Lagann. Instead they put a large emphasis on how much of a city boy he was and explained in detail the training he'd done to become stronger. Now that all this world building is out of the way

Seeing as I'm about to start what most consider the greatest VN of all time

-When Tsuyomi said Takeru was dead she was referring to the Takeru in the Beta World. I don't see how this would affect much of anything.

-They've been shoving it down our throats that Sumika and Kasumi are connected via that brain in that one room. I don't know what this has to do with anything

-Sometime during Alternative Takeru is going to find a way to get back to the Extra world. I still remember Sumika saying that he was talking nonsense about other worlds.

I've only got one question before starting, or was he transported right before they actually occurred? I'd much prefer if Sumika's or Meiya's route happened, but since Takeru mentioned he was a virgin in Unlimited, I doubt it.

If Extra was a shitstain comedy that I'd give 3/10, I'll make another thread and update it whenever I've read each segment. 

Another (meta) note: I'm actually dealing with a lot of personal stuff at the moment.

I think through the course of the entire thing

I started off with the COFFIN ending which wasn't great I guess

COFFIN -&gt; SUB -&gt; SUB -&gt; KNIFE -&gt; AXE -&gt; SAFE -&gt; TRUE

It was pretty incredible though

So, and supposedly in this one, Akane died in the incinerator after being unable to solve the puzzle. Nine years later, the second Nonary Game began and things such as experiments, kidnappings and other mishaps were mentioned from people such as Santa and Seven, in particular there was the mention of a girl who died 9 years ago. Then through the use of morphogenetic fields, she connected with Junpei between the 9 year gap to solve the incinerator room puzzle and ended up escaping with the rest of the kids and Seven.

This is where I get a little confused though. Scenes like where Seven would talk about the game 9 years ago

All in all though

Edit: Just minutes after posting this I came across this [Answers page](http://aksysgames.com/999/answers) on the 999 website which is answering a lot of my questions. I understood that Santa and Akane were working together but didn't even consider that he wasn't telling the truth to avoid a paradox. The whole idea that Akane's illness / headaches represent an incorrect route is also really fascinating.

If anything it's making me even more interested to find out more. If spoilers can be avoided

1363063262.0,1a4pkg,G-senjou no Maou Endings Discussion (SPOILERS!!!),mitojee,9,3,12,"Since this is a discussion about the various endings of G-senjou no Maou



Summary:

First of all, the artwork pleasing to the eye and the eroge content suitably sexy without being too extreme or unrealistic. Bonus for some nice voice-actress work--wow, I wonder how they felt doing the sex scenes? I'd be red in the face during the recording sessions either way. Hehehe.

 The structure was fairly simple since the chapters are pretty much linear in sequence so I followed each branch in order of length (Tsubaki, Haru). Notable plot points: as you go deeper into the story, more and more plot surprises and twists pop-up, hence Haru's end is really the story's complete and true end while all the others are technically ""dead"" ends in terms of plot; you realize that the MC, Kyousuke is a bit of a dick, but he has good reason to be once you read his tragic backstory; since Kyousuke is a cold-hearted adopted son of a ruthless yakuza lord, the plot is essentially how the 4 girls (plus one side character) use their wiles to win his heart and free him from the chains of materialistic selfishness as well as achieve their own, happy endings.

Analysis of the Endings

Primarily, so there is almost no way for everyone to be happy at the end. In some endings, the story is very tragic for some side-characters. To make this clearer, I've decided to break down the endings in the form of a relative score chart based on happiness/fulfillment for each major person in the VN. And for one character, Yuki, who is also on the cover, every end is basically tragic since she is an un-lockable route (except for Mizuha's bad end sequence where you get to bone her after tossing aside Mizuha like a used condom, simply not going to jail is her best possible ending.

Essentially, Haru's best ending is also the best Maou can achieve given the choices.  However, Haru's ending is her only possible good ending, all her other endings suck even more if you don't finish her route!

Note on my happiness scale -- range is from -5 to +5 and is based on relative, etc.). It's also a subjective scale, weighted by my personal feelings and biases. Please feel free to add your own comments/suggestions to my weighting. The reason I am using this scale is to quantify how, objectively, the plot is tragically backwards (but still awesome and entertaining).

Tsubaki Route Happiness/Fulfillment Results

Tsubaki : (+5)  -- She gets the love of her life, they make a modest profit. Life is beautiful. She played it a little too loose at times (Kyousuke even warns her once that she could be mistaken for an ""easy"" woman when she agrees to hang out at his place) but her earnestness saves her from losing a point.

Kyousuke : (+4) -- He achieves stalemate against his yakuza father, however, he gets to keep his mother, has a healthy relationship based on trust and honor. Gonzou considers him a sheep but so what, the guy is a thug.
                    
Haru: (-4)  -- She is defeated by Maou, and probably ends up either dead or a lonely old cat lady. I'd make it -5 if it was certain that Maou kills her at some point.

Kanon: (0 ) -- she is a selfish

Mizuwa: (0) -- since so little of her is seen at this point

Maou: (+1) -- only for not being caught and being a mystery

Yuki: (-3) -- She starts off negative because she already sold her soul to evil for revenge plus she never even gets to do anything in this chapter.

Kyousuke's mom : (+3) She is mentally unstable but now has a daughter in law and a wholesome family who can help his son take care of her.

Kyousuke's Dad: (0) He remains on death row for a crime he was guilty of so he doesn't deserve anything else than no change. From an absolute scale

Society at large: (0) From society's standpoint, no one died, no major overt criminal activity, usual corruption continues.


--------------

Kanon Route Results

Tsubaki: (-1) --  She fails to gain her love interest

Kyousuke: (+3) -- He allows himself to fall in love to a famous, he is still a bit of a sheep and his love for Kanon is mired by potential scandal.

Haru: (-4)  -- She is once again defeated by Maou, and probably ends up either dead or a lonely old cat lady. I'd make it -5 if it was certain that Maou kills her at some point.

Kanon: (+4) -- She has reconciled with her mother, but it worked out (hence, the loss of a point).

Mizuwa : (0) -- Still pretty neutral for the most part

Maou: (+1) -- Just barely a plus one for still not being caught or revealed

Yuki: (-2) -- She is still doomed

Kyousuke's Mom: (+1) -- There is a light at the end of her tunnel but still too many unknowns

Kyousike's Dad; (0) -- Still on death row.

Society at Large: (0) Slightly negative

---------

Mizuwa Route Results

Tsubaki: (-1) -- Same as Kanon route.

Kyousuke: (+3) -- Although he wasn't really interested, so his cash debt is a lot lower now, though it means he will have to deal with Gonzou and crew more in the future. His mother is still an unknown factor, but at least he can take care of her financially.

Haru: (-4) -- She's still pretty much screwed. Her association with the yakuza now may help her survival prospects

Kanon: (-1) -- She tried but failed to win over Kyousuke. She practically served herself to him but he rebuffed her at every turn. She remains selfish and insecure and doesn't reconcile with her mother.

Mizuwa: (+3.5) -- She has reconciled with both her father and her estranged sister and finally nabbed the boy she has loved for years with her sister's help and several more years of self-improvement. However

Maou: (0) -- Although he still remains a mystery and he has made more inroads toward his ultimate plans

Yuki: (-1) -- She has succeeded in her goals: she has avenged the murder of her mother

Kyousuke's Mom: (+1) -- Not much hope for happiness but at least some consistency

Kyousuke's Dad : (0) -- Still on death row.

Society at Large: (-1) Crimes have been committed and not all punished. People died

I think I've nailed down some of the basic grammar rules in Japanese. I want to make an attempt at reading something new that I have never read before.

If Sumika could change Takeru's original world to a better one, according to Professor's theory, he could only go back to his original world because he remembered it, so he couldn't possibly go back to the another one.

***RUNNING CHARACTER LIST - PROLOGUE***


**Layer 1 -'Real' World**


Faceless Storyteller: ?

Faceless Listener: Alice


**Layer 2 -'Shinjuku' World**

Office-worker: Amenomori

Prostitute: Nagatsuki

Restaurant Manager: Kariya

Med Student: Mayuzumi 

?: Akeru

**Layer 3 - 'Forest' World**

Real Alice: Storyteller/Listener Alice

Alice in Wonderland/Guest -&gt; Stranger : Amenomori

Mad Hatter: Nagatsuki

March Hare: Kariya

Dormouse: Mayuzumi 

Etrangere -&gt; None: Akeru

**THINGS TO THINK ABOUT**

- So we got two nested stories, we have the rest of the cast, sans the faceless narrator. You might argue that the 'Forest' is a third layer,  another story underneath the mundane Shinjuku story. **We also can't trust anything below the first layer.** Alice and narrator-dude keep fucking around with the continuity, revising how things should be and how they need to resolve. To borrow the words of a wise man: what the shit.


- A lot of 'what' questions are kinda futile at this point of the story. What's a gift? What's the forest? What's a riddle? Why these particular people? I trust the VN to be kind enough to my narrative sensibilities to at least partially answer these questions. What's far more interesting to ask is **why we start off examining Amenomori's neuroses


- This prologue is hemorrhaging Lewis Carrol. Alice in Wonderland is rather popular source material to draw upon - but what the hell is Reepicheep doing here? That dude's from Narnia


- Akeru has serious beef with Alice. That kid knows somethin'

So any suggestions on how to find any good artists? I can detail parts of the story if anybody here is interested. After all

---------------------------------------------------------
**TL;DR** we're looking for a good artist because we don't like crappy OEL VNs

--------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT: Synopsis. Warning

The year is 2097. World War III breaks out, a supernatural phenomenon instantaneously melts down much of the northern Polar Ice Cap. The resulting flood consumes all the major coastlines of the world in a matter of hours. Billions perish, and human civilization is thrown back to an era that hasn't been seen for centuries.

Amidst this chaotic world, and now, over 450 years later, humanity has restored much of it's former glory.

On an island city in this new modern age, who abandoned him and his older sister after putting her through severe magi training, leaving her brain-dead and hospitalized. He carefully plans his revenge, which includes conducting meticulous research, spying on his father's magi associates, and thoroughly researching Eternum, the magical society run by his father that governs from the shadows.

And yet, strange phenomena within the city, and a curious connection to the mysterious phenomenon that caused the Great Calamity over 450 years ago.

Yet strangest of all, and her sly, smart attitude proves to be quite worrisome.

**What I'm curious about is just whos side everyone is on in the Occult club?**  I may be jumping to conclusions but it seems as though Kotori was the odd man out with at least 3 factions trying to stop/kill her unless I am misunderstanding.

That kind of irked me a bit because assuming each girl works for each one of these factions then they went from school buddies to mortal enemies of Kotori in a heartbeat.  I'm sure it's more complicated than that and from Kotori's ending it seems at the very least Shizuru has no desire to hurt them.

Am I way off base here?  After the friendly common route it seems like everyone goes their separate ways(which makes sense as it's their route) but from my limited perspective it seems like it puts the heroines at odds with each other.

I've laughed and cried and everything in between with the ones I've read so far and thought they were all good in their own right.

I went into it because I was a fan of the Higurashi anime

Episode 1[](/s "" was brilliant to start things off, with me eager to know what was happening. I love how it all kept building up as people got separated due to suspicion and people were getting picked off one after the other."")

Episode 2[](/s "" left me excited and once again, and how it all related to closed rooms and bizarre murders. I began to find it less scary and more entertaining to see how people react to the situations, and things also started to get much more supernatural it seemed with Kanon and Shannon using their blade/shield things. Seeing Battler pretty much give up near the end wasn't expected, but it was great to see him make a return in the Tea Party segment."")

Episode 3[](/s ""was probably my favourite episode (partly down to Ronove being a brilliant character). When it started, but that was all thrown out of the window soon enough. EVA Beatrice was...terrifying, and her faces creeped me out endlessly. One of my favourite scenes was when Rudolf and Kyrie were fighting against a seperate Stake of Purgatory each, but the biggest surprise would be how I was fooled the entire time by Beatrice. My opinions of her were changing throughout, and I thought massive character development was happening in a good way. A chill ran down my spine when Beatrice and Virgilia's faces changed when telling Battler to sign the contract towards the end, and my mind really was just blown."")

Episode 4[](/s ""probably took me the longest to get going for whatever reason. It wasn't that I found the Ange sections at her school and such tedious at all, the Tea Party in episode 4 stands up there one of my favourite scenes from all 4 episodes so far. It was just epic to see Battler and Beatrice have a showdown recollecting the past 4 games and try to prove/disprove everything with the battle between the red and blue text."")

The soundtrack to Umineko is also phenomenal. The composer (or composers if multiple) has really done a fantastic job. There are so many stand-outs to me, but I don't think there was a single track I got sick of hearing.

Can't wait to get started on episodes 5-8 anyway

1354711434.0,14biz3,Dizzy Hearts by Lupiesoft,Taosym,9,2,3,"Hello everyone

Here's a small snippet of what DH is about from the blog:  


[Dizzy Hearts Blog](http://lupiesoft.blogspot.com/)  

+ *Dizzy Hearts is a 18+ futanari romance Visual Novel featuring the story of Seriva, in the tradition of her people. 
She meets the young Princess Mercilia a hermaphroditic ""fiore"" who is at odds with her duty to become queen.*  

-

Dizzy Hearts is an eroge with a strong romance theme, pre-modern feel. Currently the aim of my game is to create a story that I feel is strongly underrepresented in VNs, and in erotica in general. That is, a more serious take on the futanari story with more emphasis on reasonable proportions and erotic themes, rather than hyper, or other size fetishes. While they've been done before, they are very rare.
 
- 
  
Games/stories you see today with futa have it just for the sake of futa. They are often fairly extreme. So DH is not only my personal aim to do something different with the medium, you lament the lack of serious games that try and tell a story, and that sex is just randomly thrown in because people
expect it to be

Because I'm both doing the art, and pushing for a beta to begin around February 1st.

If Battler is truly the adopted child of Natsuhi chosen by Kinzo, Battler would have inherited Kinzo's gold whether or not he solved the epitaph. Being deprived that right must be a little infuriating, eh? But I feel like this is more than an issue of money, greed is a pretty shallow motive for Ryukishi07. I mean, there is also the motive for revenge for abandonment, but that would only concern Natsuhi, why kill everyone?

Battler also never returns from Rokkenjima. Does he commit suicide, the less it makes sense

I honestly have no idea whether Ange is a witch or if she's just delusional. In fact

The only thing I am sure about, specifically. The Battler from episode 1 (the one that is currently in purgatorio) is either crazy or actually in the witch's realm, and either way cannot be trusted. Also, I believe the Tea Party (where Battler 'killed' Beatrice with the blue truth) is a delusion, and can therefore not be trusted either. After all, if we trust any other viewpoint, witches are most certainly real.

I have absolutely no theories for this Episode. Well, none of those thoughts are organized enough in order to make any solid claims. What I did put some solid effort into, however, is solving the riddle of the epitaph.

Now, eh? Anyways, here's what I've got so far:

- The epitaph obviously has something to do with maria. The novel specifically pointed out that Maria shares a character in her name with the word villiage. The secret area that Eva found has to be on the island somewhere as well. The only place where these two thoughts directly intersect is where the rose wilted

- Ayu, which can also mean bountiful. I think the bountiful description is the key to solving this aspect. The 'bountiful river' is actually not a river, but actually some sort of path that appears bountiful, probably into the woods and to the kuwadorian (which is where I think the treasure is)

- Maria's name, Villiage, and Follow; in that order. Follow the True Villiage.  里, however, can also mean a few other things, among them being Surname and *Country House*. So what Maria's name could be saying is 'follow the true house' as in, kumadorian. This is why the epitaph specifically used the character 里; in order to point Maria's name out.

- The 'golden land', gold metal, and village. This method of writing golden land, however, is different from using the character for villiage found in Maria's name. This method uses the character 郷 instead. 郷 can mean multiple other things besides village, the most notable of them being *birthplace*. It is entirely possible that Beatrice was born in the Kuwadorian, considering hold young she appears

It isn't much to show for, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers at all costs and looking at the wiki is probably the quickest way to destroy that hope.

Ange's backstory is still a little scattered in my mind, which forced him to move in with Rudolf. Then she got sick and everyone except her died, leaving her in the care of Eva. Then Eva died and Ange inherited the title of Golden Witch. The only problem is, how is she going to help Battler fight the existence of witches if she pretty much time-traveled to him, making the existence of witches apparent in her eyes. 

Also

Anyways, though.

* When Eva was trying to figure out the riddle of the epitaph, the Ushiromiya name). Latter means shore, but it's the characters cliff and edge of land smashed together into one character. Another place  where there was a cliff is where Beatrice died. I think that area is where the gold is hidden, although I'm not sure.

* Witches aren't really witches, there exists a sort of illusionary dust (or maybe a virus) that makes people see what they believe they *should* see. For instance, if someone says a giant ox man is going to appear and kill them, that's what they sense. If you've ever played Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, it's much like that. So a lot of people had their brains 'shut off' when they thought they would die, making there no murderer and no suicide for many of the locked rooms, but rather an incident caused by enviromental factors. This dust can also make people go crazy and kill others. The source of this dust would probably be the place where the gold is stored

* Beato said there were only 18 people on the island, and then a 19th person would have room amongst the 18, with the family members not noticing being of the dust. The dust theory is extremely flexible, but that makes it almost a bad theory since I might rely on it to explain too much. After all, I'm only on episode III, I doubt I have all the pieces to make a full theory.

I find that in mystery stories like this where a binomial option is presented (witch/no witch, I have no idea. Hopefully I find out in the next chapter.

Anyways, and absolutely no mention of any golden land. 

I also got to meet LambdaDelta at the ??? portion of this arc. I feel like the association between her and Takano Miyo was a severe curveball. Maybe, but they have pretty much zero evidence and I'd sound like a crackpot if I put them into words.

Current theories are as follows:

* Shannon and Kanon are homunculi. They can't possibly be human, **they were created using kinzo's blood as a base**. The orphanage is actually breeding ground for homunculi, which would fit considering none of the orphans would have parents. Finally, it would explain why they call themselves furniture: They are not actually human, but created to serve a purpose. By this logic, Genji would also be a homunculus. Gohda and Kumawasa are human (though why they were hired is a mystery to me)

* Witches powers are dependent on the belief of others. This would be one of the reasons why Beatrice desperately wants people to believe despite the fact that she obviously has some sort of magic power. It would also explain why the more sacrifices occur, more people start to believe in the witch

* The seven icepick's names are references to [Peter Binsfeld's classification of demons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_demons#Binsfeld.27s_classification_of_demons) with the person being stabbed by the icepick of satan (Kanon) having the sin of wrath etc etc. Does that mean being without sin make you immune to the sacrifice? In that case

Im suprised how fast I blew through Act two. I think I might wait a day or two before starting the third one,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,t3_1gk1h5

1370837409.0,1g0x18,Little Busters Route Analysis - Kudryavka Noumi (game-breaking spoilers! Hopefully this is interesting),OilySalmon,6,2,3,"A couple days ago, something that at least some people on here didn't notice in their first playthrough. Or maybe I'm just just being a mix of stupid and arrogant

Without further ado, but I figured that at least one other person would find some of this interesting.

&gt;Kud mentions getting a letter from her mother inviting her to return to Tevua before the bus accident. She refused. The ""Important thing"" that she mentions when she's bound up in the cave would supposedly ""destroy the world"" or something along those lines (I don't recall exactly what she said- just that she mentions the world and says おしまい.)

&gt;Her regret over not going to see her parents, her fear of never being able to see them again and her wanting to atone for that manifests into her route; she's not in conscious control of what happens.

&gt;Kyousuke acts pretty suspicious in a few places along this route too, a few days before she leaves. When Masato asks him if something could be done about it, Kyousuke says something along the lines of this being 'the way it has to be'. My guess is that Masato wasn't asking Kyousuke to stop Kud from going. My feeling is that he, Kengo and obviously Kyousuke knows what's going on with Kud, her parents, and everything else. Knowing what we know about how this dream world ends, Masato and Kengo know what this world is from the very beginning. I think Kud realizes what's happened to all of them too, and that the world they're in is a fiction.

&gt;One thing doesn't make sense to me though- Ricky finds the dog tag with the gear melted onto it in that box soon after Kud is captured by the rioters, she says ""I was stupid. I made a mistake at a critical moment. 'That thing' (the dog tags) is a piece of the crashed rocket I got afterwards."" I'm not sure what this implies. Does this mean that what had happened in the dream world had happened in the real world, to a lesser degree? Did her parents actually die, in the real world, before the bus accident?",,False,t5_2r5yf,True

The last major risk is that of legal action on the part of MoeNovel or the ESRB. It would be an unauthorised modification to a retail game that adds content that would knock up the rating from a T to AO. I'm not sure how willing I am to take that risk.

1366518405.0,1cs8ij,I finally saw Steins;Gate choice! But now I have lots of questions. [Spoiler],Keksus_,6,0,11,"After watching the anime 2 years ago I finally got around completing the VN. And with completing I mean completing. Played it for maybe 50 hours and watched every single ending. The [true end](http://i.imgur.com/gO1E1OZ.jpg) made me tear up.

But some questions popped up in my head

First of all the time travel theory the game uses. If I put everything together correctly than there always exists only one world line and all other world lines are only figuratively. They only are possibilities what could be if this and that happened but don't exist parallel.

And then Reading Steiner is an ability everybody has

There may also be people who can't notice at all. This isn't mentioned in the VN

Then after every change made due to time travel the world is completely rebuild.

What I don't understand is why a D-Mail has such a great effect on the divergence but a time leap or even physical time travel has barely any effect. I mean the principle is the same, according to the theory stated in the game. But theoretically he could've time leaped and known that he mustn't stop Suzu. Wouldn't this lead to the same result as sending the D-Mail?

Next is Makise death. How could he prevent that? Of course the plan was to deceive his first self to deceive the world. And it was said he can deceive his first self because he only saw lying Kurisu in a puddle of blood but didn't observed if she was alive or not. But at the first time he time travelled there he did observe her death. So how was he able to change this?

The next thing has also to do with the time travel during the true end. Everything that happened there is part of the S;G world line. Meaning the arrival of Suzu as well as Okabes time travelling to save Kurisu. Yet the Steins;gate worldline is a world line with an unwritten future. Suzuha vanishes because there is no future she can return to. After all that future is still being written. But that also means there is no way that Suzu could have come with a time machine and travelled back with Okabe to save Kurisu. This is a paradox. Suzu has to time travel to make Steins;gate possible.

Also the ""second"" Okabe can't possibly accomplish anything there. They tried to explain this with future Okabe saying he has to fail once so he has the ambition to create a new time machine. But why would he do that than he succeeded the second time? It's not a matter of how often he tried

To be precise he has to deceive the ""second"" Okabe in the Steins;Gate timeline. I actually thought at first that this is exactly what he was doing. He sends Suzu back and tells her what she has to tell the second Okabe. So WW3 and so on were just a lie. But that would mean that Suzu can return to the future. But she vanished without a trace because

Another point is the movie D-Mail. Why could he suddenly watch it?

And did I understand it correctly that Moeka and Mr. Braun are still working for the Rounders who are still trying to find all the IBM5100s for SERN?

Another thing isn't related to the story but to how I can unlock stuff: I have every CG unlocked except for the last one on page 7. How can I get that? After all I saw all 6 endings and I think I should've seen everything the game has to offer.

This is all I can think of for now. I hope you can explain some things to me.
