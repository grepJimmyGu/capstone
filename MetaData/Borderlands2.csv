If its not here then the skill works exactly as it says in the tooltip.

After many hours of testing this is what I have.

____
General combat

* Kill skills last **7 seconds**

* Melee attacks crit for **2x** damage and none of the critical hit damage bonuses change that.

* The melee damage bonus % found on weapons is multiplicative rather than additive

____
***Zero***
____

* **Deception** 

Action Skill. Press button to create a holographic decoy and vanish for a few seconds**(6 seconds)**. The longer you are invisible the more Damage your next attack deals

**A minimum of  230%** up to +650% Melee Damage

**A minimum of 40%** Up to +200% Gun Damage

~~Up to +250% Gun Critical Hit Damage~~

Lies. **Deception does not give any Critical him damage increase** at all

_____
***Bloodshed***


* **Killing blow**

When exactly is an enemy  **""low on health""** ? 

When below **30% health**.

The damage bonus from this skill is multiplicative rather than additive

* **Execute**

How much exactly is this **""massive damage""** ?

This skill changes the melee damage bonus of deception from 

A minimum of 230% up to 650% Melee damage to

**A minimum of 460% up to 1400% increased Melee damage**

* **Many must fall**

How much time does it add to the duration of Deception ?

**~2 seconds**
_____

***Cunning***

* **Counter Strike**

What activates it ? 

Bullets and melee attacks definitely do

* **Ambush**

Do I get the bonus if enemies are targeting my decoy ? 

**Yes**

* **Unforeseen**

Do the additional decoys created by **Many must fall explode** ?

**Yes.**

* **Death Mark**

The damage bonus is multiplicative or additive ?

**Multiplicative.**

* **Death Blossom**

You throw 4 daggers at a time and you can do that 5 times. They can have any of the 5 elemental types. This skill is a very reliable way of applying slag and overall it does fantastic damage on its own.

To apply **Death mark** you have to directly hit an enemy

___
***Sniping***

* **Kill Confirmed**

How long does it take to get the full bonus ?

**~ 2.7 seconds**

* **Critical Ascension**

You start losing stacks after **6 seconds.**

You lose 1 stack Per second.

Switching weapon, quest log, etc), using a vending machine, talking to a quest giver and dieing instantly removes all stacks.

You can melee

___

***Gaige***
___

* **Summon Deathtrap**

60 seconds cooldown
___
***Ordered Chaos***

* **Robot Rampage**

**Cooldown - 13 seconds.**

Misleading tooltip. It's not 7 attacks

DT spins for 2 seconds dealing 9 attacks to all enemies near him. Each of those 9 attacks does 62% of his normal melee attack damage. At the end of his spin he does an instant normal attack with no delay for full damage.


In other words

* **Discord**

Cost - **1.33 stacks per second.**

* **Death from Above**

Cooldown - 2 seconds.

Sadly this awesome skill was not implemented very well. You don't have full control over when it activates. Shooting while walking on uneven surfaces or getting hit by bullets and getting lifting inches off the ground as result can activate this skill.  As a result investing in this skill can makes managing your Anarchy stacks much harder.

* **The Nth Degree**

**Do NOT invest more than one point in this skill.**

In the best case scenario (if there are always enemies in range) you will get 11.1% damage increase from this skill. This is not a bad deal

* **With Claws**

At the cost of 1 Anarchy stack you do 2 swipes

At 1% heath this skill heals for up to ~**30%** of your heath per swipe. At 90% health it will heal for ~5% of your health.

Also important to note is that because of both swipes do full melee damage and the speed at which you can use this attack this skill effectively gives you **50%  increased melee attack speed.**

___
***Little Big Trouble***

* **The Stare**

**Cooldown - 15 seconds.**

Does high amount of burn damage to a **single target.**

Not affected by Evil Enchantress or badass rank bonuses.

* **Shock Storm**

Can activate Electrical burn even if created by Deathtrap.

* **One Two Boom**

**Cooldown - 42 seconds.**

Cannot be activated with E-tech weapons.

* **Interspersed Outburst**

First stack after **2 seconds** of not shooting.

Full stacks after **9.3 seconds** of not shooting.

**The damage is based on character level and the number of stacks only.** It will do the same damage with 1 or 5 points invested.
**The chance to slag is 2% per rank for each stack.** So with 5 stacks at rank 5 the chance to slag is 50%.

This is how it works in TVHM, but investing points in to it did.


***Make It Sparkle***

Each of his melee attacks does additional damage equal to **2x** his base melee damage.

Because it takes the base damage and not the actual damage Strength of 5 Gorillas

The elemental damage he does is also affected by the elemental damage type multipliers. So for example if Deathtrap does 1000 damage with his melee attacks and you slag him

**But there is more

This is because it does the full bonus elemental damage on each attack.

Let me toss some numbers at you.

My level 39 Deathtrap does 5500 damage with his melee attack. If I send him with no upgrades vs a Super Badass Loader he will do 11k damage in 2 seconds.

If he has Make it Sparkle and Robot Rampage and I give him corrosive attacks he will do:

36190 damage normal damage + 192500 corrosive damage.

**So from 11k to 229k damage in 2 seconds.**

And I could slag that enemy for him
___
***Best Friends Forever***

* **Buck Up**

**Cooldown - 18 seconds.**

Because of a bug Deathtrap will sometimes use this ability on your enemies.

In True Vault Hunter Mode it only restores 30% of your shields.

Because of this in TVHM this skill is a complete waste of Deathtraps time and should always be avoided.

I can't test this any more, but when 

I tested it in TVHM it was only restoring 30%(as the tooltip states). Going back to Normal mode after I have unlocked TVHM does not change that.

* **Explosive Clap**

**Cooldown - 25 seconds.**

Does pretty good amount of damage in a very large radius.

* **Sharing is Caring**

Deathtrap does not benefit from the special effect of Amp Shields.

Spike

Absorb shields do not give you ammo

Don't have a way of testing if Turtle shields reduce his heath or do adaptive shields boost his health and resistances.

___

***Maya***
___
* **Phaselock**

How long does it last by default ?

**5 seconds**
___
***Cataclysm***

* **Flicker**

How does it work ?

It increases the chance to apply an elemental effect that the weapon has by said %.
(example

* **Helios**

Does it apply to targets that cannot be phaselocked ?

**Yes.**

* **Ruin**

How does it work ?

It creates 3  explosions with the center being the phaselocked target. Slag

___
***Harmony***

* **Life tap**

How does it work ?

Instantly restores health equal to x% of any damage you do. Works with  guns, melee attacks, damage over time effects, any damage you do.

* **Scorn**

How does it work ? 

Sends out a slow moving orb that explodes on impact doing minor slag damage. While flying the orb also sends out slag tendrils to all enemies around it

___
***Motion***

* **Kinetic Reflection**

Can I become immune to bullets if I have 10 points in to this skill ?

**Yes.**

* **Sub-Sequence**

How does it work ?

Once the phaselocked target dies the spell starts moving the same way homing grenades do and seeks another target.

While the spell is moving to another target the duration of phaselock keeps going down. Also when its seeking another target Wreck

Chain reaction are not active.

Every time it hits a new target Converge and Helios are reapplied.

* **Thoughtlock**

Do Converge, Chain reaction and Elated work with Thoughtlock ?

**Yes.**

___
***Salvador***
___

* **Gunzerking**

By default this skill lasts 20 seconds and provides 33.3% damage reduction.

___
***Brawn***

* **I'm the Juggernaut**

At 5 points the 20% damage reduction you are supposed to get is more like ~16.5%. It's a great skill nonetheless.

When combined with **Gunzerking** it results in 41% damage reduction.

* **Fistful of Hurt**

How much is ""massive damage"" ?

**300%** increased melee damage.

* **Come At Me Bro**

How much damage reduction do I get and how long does it last ?

The buff lasts **8 seconds** and it increases the damage reduction to **66.6%**. 

When combined with **I'm the Juggernaut**(5 points) it results in  ~ 71% damage reduction.

___
***Rampage***

* **Get Some**
It is important to note that this skill also works while you are **Gunzerking**


* **Keep Firing...**

How does it work ?

You just have to keep your finger on the triggers

Reloading does not seem to affect the bonus fire rate.


Not sure exactly how long it takes to get the maximum bonuses

____
***Gun Lust***

* **All I Need is One**

Best thing about this skill is that it works with rocket launchers.

* **Money Shot**

Does not work with Rocket Launchers. 

No all that great when using TORGUE weapons because of the way explosive weapon damage is calculated.

With 5 points in the skill the damage bonus for **clip size** is as follows:

1 = 0% (You sttil hear the sound

2 = 80%

3 = 120%

4 = 160%

5 = 200%

6 = 240%

7 = 280%

8 = 320%

9 = 360%

10 = 400%

**11 = 440%!**

**12+ = 480%!**

I had to farm the Warrior for white items with small clip sizes to test this

* **Keep It Piping Hot**

Because of a bug this skill does not work if you have any cooldown reduction bonuses.

* **No Kill Like Overkill**

How does it work ?

It works exactly as it says

The cap is 5x as much damage as you would do with no overkill bonus. That damage bonus is multiplicative and is applied at the end of the equation.

Whatever damage you can do without the overkill bonus you can do up to 5 times as much damage with the overkill bonus
For example if you can hit a slagged target for 100k damage with the bonus from ""All I need is one"" and ""Money Shot"" and no Overkill bonus

At least that is how I think it works
___
***Axton***
___

* **Sabre Turret**

How long does it last by default ?

23 seconds

___

***Gunpowder***

* **Steady**

This skill states that it increases grenade damage

* **Do or die**

Same thing as **Steady.**

* **Battlefront** 

Same as the two above

* **Nuke**

Is there any way to increase the damage this thing does ?

Slag the target before deploying the turret

____
***Guerrilla***

* **Scorched Earth**

Equipping your turret with rocked pods also decreases the damage the gun of the turret does by **13%**
 
* **Double Up**

This upgrade also decreases the gun damage by **13%**. This results in a **74%** increased damage  for having 2 guns rather than the 100% increase that you would expect. 
If you combine this with rocket pods then you will be only getting **54%** increased turret gun damage.

If you take Gemini without pods then you will have 100% increased turret gun damage

All of that does not mean that rocket pods are not worth it.
___
___

Cannot guarantee that everything here is true

1355331391.0,14qd3e,A Vault Hunter's Guide to THVM and Playthrough 2.5!,HelloPillowbug,292,46,60,"I've been seeing a lot of people ask questions about farming, I have found bits and pieces from many threads and I felt that it would be helpful to compile all of the information that I found into one general FAQ. 

**Introduction**

So you’ve beaten Borderlands 2. Congratulations! What’s this? True Vault Hunter Mode
 
Or maybe you go on the /r/borderlands2 and you see all these people sporting legendary (orange) weapons like nobody’s business and you want some of it yourself. 

This guide is here to clear that stuff up. 

**True Vault Hunter Mode**

The game has been out for a while so I’m not surprised if many of you haven’t at least accessed TVHM yet.  Basically, and weapons that you obtained in your first playthrough. You’ll be all the way back from the very start at whatever level you finished your first run through Pandora. 

What else makes TVHM different? Well
Pandora is seriously out to get you this time around

Some tips:

* Get a reliable shield. Fast shield recharge rate and low recharge delay are definitely things that you wanna look for. Anything else (spikes, elementals) is all up to your discretion. As long as it can hold up while you’re getting mobbed by enemies, you should be good. 

* Slag may not have been so popular your first time through but now it’s something you want to use dearly. Marcus showed you in one of his earlier missions that slag increases the damage an enemy takes. Take advantage of that. The enemies are REALLY tough now. 

* Play with others! Teamwork can take the load off things

**Farming (and a little bit of PT 2.5)**

So you’re using those tips and all is going well. You’re strolling through Pandora

I can’t find a clever way to segue into this next set of tips

First of all

Why save the sidequests? Well, all of the missions you’ve left untouched scale to level 50. The difficulty may have scaled but that also means the rewards did too. Would you rather have a level 45 Flame of the Firehawk shield? Or one that’s level 50? There’s no PT 3… yet (Or maybe there won’t be one at all. Just saying). You won’t be able to do the mission again when everything scales up. 

**How to farm!**

This requires a ~~little~~ lot patience

1. Find the item that you wanna farm. 
2. Reach the enemy/boss that drops it.
3. MDK the designated target.
4. If it drops what you wanted

That’s it. 

Now

Well, start your hunt for glory.

**Moonshot Farming**

For a quick video guide

As for other farming methods

""For PS3/360 players

The set up:
Kill Warrior in story mission. Do not moonshoot Warrior at the console. Go jump off the cliff and die. Upon spawning

Moonshooting:

1. Load game.
2. Add a splitscreen 2nd player. Let the newly added 2nd player moonshoot Warrior and collect the loot.
3. Access 2p's menu
4. Use 1p to exit to XMB

Repeat 1 to 4.

If you made a mistake

For PC players

**Treasure Room Farming**

After beating The Leviathan in Captain Scarlet and Her Pirate's Booty DLC

To farm THE TREASURE ROOM (fanfare)

When killing a boss, see an orange or pearlescent maybe, and the job is done. It's a little more tasking being colorblind. I personally cannot differentiate a green from an orange, a blue from a purple, or a white from a cyan. This means that whenever loot from any source is on the ground, I have to inspect every single thing to know what's been dropped. Just the other day I missed a 61 bee shield because it had a few greens near it. Another player in game was able to pick up on it right away and snag it.

Now

As a community, orange, and cyan loot. That way, if you don't see a *, you can tell right away that either a white, green, or blue item has dropped.

That's just my idea. If you like it, or offer an alternative solution.

First and foremost they are purely cosmetic. They allow those of us to help self identify by expressing our characters how we would like. 

More importantly, but it doesn't hinder any future development though. Cosmetic content allows their artists/creative departments to do something productive in their downtime. Nearing the end of content development most of their job is completely done. Releasing skins for purchase allows them to bring in profits and be productive.

Many of us would argue that the skins should be free,False,self,t5_2spu9,False,,pc,t3_17310g

I propose a multi-step solution to fixing this sub:

1: Don't submit a picture that even YOU have trouble seeing. If you can't see it

2: DON'T REPOST! EVEEEEER! If you start a post saying ""i think i saw a post like this earlier"" or ""i know this has been asked before"" DON'T POST THAT SHIT! Find the other post(s) and comment there. Maybe you'll find the solution to your problem without even asking!

3: Fuck yo pink couch. If you see a graphics glitch

4: No one gives a FUCK about your new legendary. If you're gonna post it use /r/borderlandsguns. Exceptions include (but are not limited to): Multiple legend/pearl drops from enemies that don't normally do so

5: sP3ak N0rmaLly. Borderlands 2 is a M-rated game. This means you should not be on this sub-reddit unless you're over the age of 17. However, punctuation, spelling; fucking write. Everyone makes mistakes, but jesus...

But it has its serious moments too. My first realization of this came with meeting Tiny Tina. Cute little girl with a knack for explosives? Great! But the mission where you help her get revenge on the man who sold out her family made me step back and think about her in a different light. She's a little girl

Then there was the Bloodwing fight. Now, EVER, felt bad about who I was killing. Having to listen to Mordecai's pleas to his friend while I pumped bullet after bullet into her really made me hate what I was doing. Not only that, but I identified with these characters in a way I couldn't with any other game. I had BEEN Mordecai and Bloodwing in BL1, seen the world through their eyes, killed the Destroyer with them... I felt emotionally attatched to them. And to see her killed, to hear Mordecai cry out in shock like that... It got to me.

Then Roland died. Honestly I saw it coming... But still, talking bullet hoses. Call me sappy, call me wierd, but I actually felt something when these characters died. And thats my hope for many other video games, that they can give me that same level of attachment to their characters.",,False,t5_2spu9,True

Below are a few ideas I had, along with the ""game-changer"" 1 level skills, which are labeled Mid-tier and Top-tier respectively.  Let me know what you think.

M1-CK Loader Unit (Or Mick)

Class: Rogue Loader

A Hyperion prototype loader who was once under Handsome Jack’s control.  Due to a severe programming error

Action Skill: Stasis Shield – A Hyperion prototype shield.  Projects and drops a dome-shaped shield in the area surrounding him at that moment.  (Sort of like the ION Loader’s ION Shield

Base duration: 15 Seconds.  Base Cooldown: 30 Seconds.  Provides you and all allies inside the shield with a 20% damage and movement speed bonus and 20% damage reduction.  

Melee: Left hand digistructs into a large drill

Skill Trees –


Programming Skill Tree – Dedicated to upgrading Mick’s software and programming.  Focuses on Accuracy and Offensive improvement.
  
Stay On Target: Increases Accuracy 4% and Aim Speed 8%.  Levels – 5

Code 187: (Kill Skill) Killing an enemy gives you +10% Recoil Reduction and Movement Speed for a few seconds.  Levels – 5

(Mid Tier) Ion Charge: Enemies inside your Stasis Shield receive shock damage.  Levels – 1


Hardware Skill Tree– Focuses on boosting defense capabilities.

Leechin’:  .5% of damage given to an enemy is restored to your shield.  Levels – 5

What I don't understand is why does the bank tab max out at 27? I don't mind purchasing more bank tabs, and nothing to do with it. It's not even like storage is impossible to gain access too; if I really want the space, I'll roll an alt then transfer it all using Claptrap's Secret Stash. It's a pain, but I'll do it. So why not let us spend our huge stacks of Eridium for (maybe not infinite) but a greatly expanded bank?
