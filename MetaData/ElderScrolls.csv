* If an NPC sees an ally get shot down

* Allow the player to set mechanical traps for NPCs to blunder into. Magic shouldn't be the only method for laying traps for enemies.

* Grappling hooks and climbing ropes. Daggerfall's wall climbing ability was fantastic and should see a return. Adding in the ability to break into buildings through windows and balconies this way would be an added bonus.

**Thief Mechanics**

* Get rid of the stupid ""stolen item"" flag for merchants. If I steal some silver bars in Markarth and then travel to Solitude

* Put more valuable items in upscale homes. One thing I used to love in earlier games was breaking into upscale homes and stealing silver goblets, jewelry, and other high-price items to fence.

Hi /r/ElderScrolls

I hope you'll get a kick out of this project. For over a year I've been working on **FRONTIERS

- [Here's a trailer

Today I'm launching an [IndieGoGo campaign](http://igg.me/at/frontiers/) to finish this sucker by January 2014. I've been working out of pocket but that has become unsustainable - it's down to shelving it forever or getting it crowdfunded. (But that whole sob story is on the campaign site so I'll spare you the repetition.)

When I started this game I had no clue if there was an audience for it but the reaction on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=145690935) and other places has been a relief - apparently I'm not the only one who's been daydreaming about a game like this.

If YOU'RE one of those people - if you **LOVE** exploration like I do - go pledge!

\*Note: *I skipped Morrowind because even though it's awesome

/r/ElderScrolls Message:

This is a cross post but I've got a request for you guys in particular. One of the things I like about ES players is their strong opinions about exploration. Questions like *what makes exploration fun or tedious?* and *is a pure exploration game possible?* can start a debate fifty comments deep.

If you're passionate about some feature or other you have a chance to nudge the game in that direction. Post your thoughts here or on the [Steam Greenlight discussion page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/145690935) and I'll consider them carefully.

I obviously can't implement everything - ideas conflict

1366509342.0,1crz8b,Idea for TES: 6- making horses more useful,Jimwize,48,9,28,"I have several ideas to actual make horses important

1. Fast travel can only be done with a horse
I find that while fast travel is useful
    So you'd have to wait to finally earn your way to getting a horse by some means to be able to travel far in the beginning of the game. This would also make the horse be something to guard

2. be able to mount chests and sacks on horses.
    This would make the horse also be able to be used as extra storage, a whole weight system for the horse, etc. 

3. Different breeds of horse with different stats
    Now, but is very slow, or a llama like creature that can carry a ton of stuff but is slow and weak. I feel like this would add a layer of depth to mounts that hasn't been seen yet.

4. (mostly about fast travel) Some risks that come with fast travel

    I feel that the series could have some risks and rewards with the fast travel system that could be extremely interesting. These would work through occassionally emerging from travel on the ground

While magic has been balanced greatly compared to the other games

For those who do not know, and you could still block with any weapon. My mage uses a shortsword in case of magicka burn, and it really helped. I think the idea of using hands to equip spells was a good idea, but there were just too many weapon and action restrictions in my opinion.

Another problem I had was the low number of spells. Alteration was only useful for flesh spells

**To justify

-Absorb Life/Magicka/Stamina/Attribute

-Wound

-Water Walking

-Charm (Made NPC's like you more)

-Cure Disease

-Dispel (got rid of negative spell effects)

-Encumber (Lower's enemy's max carry weight)

-Elemental resistances

-Unlocking Spells

-Long-Range Soul Trapping

-Bound Armor

-A long list of Summons including but not limited to Scamps, Ghosts, and Skeletons


The list is a lot longer

There's also the fact that Skyrim is the first game in the Elder Scrolls series to not feature a Spellmaker. This was where you named your spell, elements, and school of any spell you wanted, you paid a fee based on its power, and if you met the requirements to learn the spell, Voila! It's yours. I understand the graphical limitations of the game engine might have been to heavy, but still

Overall, I found that school to be useful) made the use of magic boring, and somewhat problematic with my use of a backup sword. Thoughts? Comments? I haven't seen a good discussion on magic so far, and I was hoping other mages out there thought the way I do on this subject.

**TL;DR: Skyrim's magic system is very primitive compared to the other 4 games in the series, and the way it doesn't mix well with two handed weapons, shields, or any playstyle other than mage for that matter. Thoughts? Opinions? I'd like to discuss.**

Do you remember first hearing about the bustling cantons of Vivec? Or the splendor the Imperial City? If you're like me

Picture this instead: you're in a small village and you hear talk about a grand capital city. You decide you have to see it and travel across hill and vale to get there. You finally arrive, some clustered in groups, all going about their daily business. Nobles traveling together, the fighter's guild in their full armor stomping around, thieves slinking in alleys. The crowd noises that you currently hear outside taverns would suddenly make sense, as there would be enough people to create such a din. 

Picture that same city housing hundreds of buildings- if someone asked you ""have you been to [the cloud district]?"" he'd be talking about an actual separate neighborhood, instead of a single alley with a few Morrowind banners hanging limply from the walls.

Of course, this is the appeal of Elder Scrolls games and that's where the immersion lies for them. But  many of the people you talk to in the series don't have a dialogue tree anyway, just a series of random greetings they can spit at you. And many homes are more or less identical inside. So i really don't feel like you'd be missing out on that much if those are your areas of concern. 

There'd have to be a (hopefully) subtle way to tell which people and buildings you can interact with, breathing city.

Uriel Septim set in motion the fulfillment of the Nerevarine prophecy by tracking down someone who met the criteria for being the Nerevarine and sending him/her to Vvardenfell

All well and good

The Empire loses traction in Morrowind as all the Dunmer - Great House and Ashlander alike - unite. The Empire's main in-road into the belligerent province had been the fact that its ruling Great Houses disliked and distrusted one another

Additionally the Imperial Cult (the Nine Divines etc), but not in favour of the Imperial Cult, surely?

The only way I can see the Empire gaining from all of this is if the Nerevarine feels indebted to it for sending him/her to Morrowind in the first place - which seems a slender justification for this reckless and potentially severely damaging course of action.

Daggerfall had it right. Lots of skills, etc. Let me make a comparison between Daggerfall and Skyrim. I'm not going to count map size

Also, and the first PC game I ever spent hours upon hours playing.

**Weapons**

Daggerfall had a total of 18 different weapons, variety is nice.

In Skyrim, which were added via DLC. Furthermore, each weapon only comes in eight different materials. Skyrim also got rid of staves as melee weapons and instead made them purely ranged spell-casting tools.

Variety is nice. Even if you just think of it as fluff, it doesn't take *that much more work* to implement three or four additional weapons, especially since many of them use the same animations. Hopefully, ESVI will have a wider variety of weapons.

**Spells**

In Daggerfall, where once again they chose to simply remove the feature completely. Spell creation was one of my favorite activities, and I was disappointed to find out that they'd removed it from Skyrim.

By comparison, was it really necessary to remove spell creation?

I'm really hoping that ESVI has spell creation. Seriously. That's a feature that absolutely needs to be brought back.

**Item Enchanting**

I liked how it worked in Daggerfall, but the option to do it in later games would have been nice.

I don't like the route that the later games took where you had to ""learn"" the enchantment from another item or know it via a spell. I would rather just have the option of paying gold for any effects that I don't know off-hand.

Item enchantment in ESVI could be the same as Skyrim and I would have only limited complaints

**Skills**

I like that they condensed *some* of the skills. It doesn't make sense that someone that excels with a sword would be completely lost if they picked up a mace. However

**Perks**

Holy God why? I know some people like the perks, for example) is just stupid. If I can't fully utilize my skill without a perk, then it's not really a ""perk"" anymore, it's a requirement.

**Setting**

Ah

Hammerfell is a desert, though I can imagine that trekking across endless desert dunes could become disorienting and monotonous. However, with its numerous ports, such a game would have a wide-open realm of potential sea-faring gameplay, including piracy, sailing, and other activities.

Elsweyr contains both jungles and arid grasslands (I'm imagining a savannah-type environment). It would provide a lot of variety for travelers

Valenwood, of course, but we've seen a lot of that already.

High Rock would be an interesting setting. Mountains and valleys means we'd basically see another landscape like Skyrim

My big question is, what about the Civil War storyline?

You can't have both sides winning the war, and really makes no sense.  So, unless I'm missing something, they will have to choose a ""winning"" side for that Civil War when they're designing they lore for the next game.  Who do you think will come out on top?

Subscription - Monthly Cost
B2P - Buy to play

Thought i'd make a thread to see what you think about it and if you differ from what i think.
 
i think its should be to B2P, missions (which could give extra XP, level points, stats for PvE but have a stat cap for PvP, and making sure those weapons unlocked in new DLC is only allowed for PvE and not allowed to be used in PvP), with this i also think they could maybe have a Subscription module, the game comes with a 6-12 month time voucher or be free first 6-16or something. That way those who purchase the game have a good time to decide whether or not they will continue playing and then can support the devs by purchasing a 3/6/9/12/24 month subscription plan. 

I believe that Free 2 Play is the incorrect way to go.That type of game will make it buy to win (if theres a Real Money Auction House) which will ruin the balance of the game.

1. How did you play your spellcaster in the TES series? 

2. How to play an authentic

I guess  **there will be a lot of spoilers here**... From Arena to Skyrim. So yeah

**Arena**: This one was really easy. All you needed was shield and absorb spell. And a decent list of damaging spells. Once you cast shield it was actually permanent

**Daggerfall**: That one was a bit tougher than Arena. What I did was following. I leveled my destruction to 90+ and then enchanted a piece of clothing/jewelry with destruction skill enhancing. That way, felt too much like exploiting, although other people might say it's not.

**Morrowind**: For some reason I never managed to make a character that would be a cool, but that's not what I'm asking for. For those who didn't play Morrowind: Enchanted items regenerate their charge over time by themselves. You don't have to recharge them yourself. So if you had a number of rings that did fire damage, you just switched to another ring when the first was depleted. And then to the third, and so on. If you had enough rings, the first one had already recharged itself by the time you used all your rings, so you could just use the first one again. As I was saying, this is not what I'm looking for, I'll just exploit it again too

**Oblivion**: Contrary to some people's opinion

You just had to make 2 custom spells. First one is weakness to magic 100% for 7 seconds. The other is weakness to shock (or other elemental) 100% coupled with weakness to magic 100% for 7 seconds. In that order. You might be wondering why 2 spells? Wait for it. You cast the first spell on you enemy. For the next 7 seconds, you just use an elemental damaging spell. With those crazy multipliers added by the 1st and 2nd spell, am apprentice damaging spell will dish out crazy amounts of damage. For best effect use a 2 seconds lasting damaging elemental spell and cast it twice if needed. My recommendation. Oh, you might be wondering why use these spells? They are A LOT more magicka effective. You can pretty much keep casting these for quite a while with good stats.

**Skyrim**: They ditched a lot of spellcasting features from TES in Skyrim, to exploit-y for me. I just played a mage-ssassin. I usually walked around invisible and muffled. With silent casting perk (illusion) and good sneak skill, the enemies barely noticed you when you cast lighting and killed someone with it. Made it easy to make a silent-pure-caster killer. Awesome for dark brotherhood. Also, did I mention how awesome it looks when you double-cast a spell?

**Battlespire**: I'm mentioning this one in the end

In addition to speech recognition and knowledge navigation


What if Bethesda incorporated a system like this into TES:VI, characters, enemies, locations, quest info, player achievements), and the game's AI could construct legible responses


You could literally enter a shop and say *""Do you have any swords for sale?""* into your microphone, check player achievements, construct a legible sentence, synthesize the verbal reply (all in about 2 seconds) and respond *""Sure, I have several!  I'm told you're very skilled with the longsword.  I have a nice ebony one you might be interested in.""*, or perhaps the merchant could say *""Sorry, I don't carry swords.""*  You get the idea.


Please note, for non-scripted speech an actor's vocal likeness could be emulated.


**PROS**


- A fun way to interact with the game.


- Every NPC interaction would be unique.


- Every NPC would have their own distinct voice and accent.  Next-gen speech synthesis software will be able to create very subtle differences in the tonal ranges, nasal, guttural, or a range of other distinct sounds.


- You wouldn't have the same ten actors used over hundreds of characters.


- You wouldn't have to hear the same lines repeated over and over again.


- You wouldn't be limited to what you can say to an NPC.  You could ask them anything


- You could find information about a merchant's inventory without opening a menu.


- You could give followers detailed verbal commands.


- ZeniMax could package this system as middleware and license it out to other developers.



**CONS**


- You will need a microphone.


- You will feel very silly at first... and look even sillier to others.


- Increased potential for glitches and bugs... many of which might be hilarious though.


- Speech may sometimes sound unconvincing


- NPCs may have difficulty understanding you.

1339383705.0,uvjuh,conversation starter for theoretical Elder Scrolls VI,CalebS92,21,1,40,"Just wanting to have a comment thing going on about ideas that would be awesome in the next elder scrolls. Besides the obvious graphics (which are already really good) and combat (which always seems to need a little more).

Some things that I have been thinking about lately is that it would make sense if the next one is the war with the Altmeri Domion. Bethesda could have a whole army/war marketing thing with some of the changes it would bring to gameplay.

I really like to repair stuff, carpenter, and some others that would be useful to make a fort better and they would stay there and have 'workshops'. Like in some forts in skyrim have a blacksmith and horse stables. Also all followers that you have would stay at your fort and do their thing.

Also maybe some kind of infrasturture economy in place for the holds. Whenever I go to whiterun the rundown walls and messed up town after the stormcloak attack bugs me. Maybe they could have if you buy/spend 100, and maybe after doing 200 bounties or whatever number some young citizens are inspired by you and become guards to help keep the hold safe and more of a presence of guards and they are stationed in some towers across the hold.

 EDIT: MORE IDEAS

Some things I enjoyed better in Oblivion was the music

TES is an Interesting subject in particular

Oblivion does not spare any detail in replicating the Roman Empire; The Legion (even in name) borrows heavily from the Latin Military used from the time of the Republic (from 509 BC
to the End of the Empire (1453 AD). The Architecture too is a lot like Rome. It looks mostly marble, are pretty Roman: Uriel Septim, Cicero Verus (like Cicero, the Roman Statesman and author), Amantius Allectus, Adrian Decanius, and others

Skyrim is really cool for Medieval European History, than full-fledged Viking. Sovngarde is a kind of reference to Asgard, the main Germanic Pagan afterlife, and the Hall of Valor representing Valhalla, the great Hall of Othin housing the fallen warriors of numerous clans. 
Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising seems to reference the many Germanic tribes rising up against the Romans around 517 AD, and other rash actions. Dragons are a HUGE part of Germanic lore. Beowulf (who could perhaps reference Dovahkiin), a Hero of the Nowell Codex, went on a quest to slay an unnamed Dragon, for prompting two other monsters to kill the members of his warrior clan. The Battle was successful, but Beowulf was mortally wounded by the Dragon's bite and fire breath.

Without further walling-of-text, here's the lore I came up with.

------------
-------
The End of the Fourth Era
---
During the height of the Skyrim Civil War, emerges in response to the return of the dragons and the looming threat of Alduin, a dragon attempting to solidify the destruction of Nirn. With the swift defeat of Alduin at the Battle of the Tongues, Fjoldyar has his say in the Skyrim Civil War, assisting the Stormcloaks in driving out the power of the Imperial Legion, however, ending a plot to assassinate the Emperor by a small sect of rediscovered Dark Brotherhood agents in Skyrim. The War ends with a treaty between the Imperial Legion that declares Skyrim as its own province until the complete removal of Aldmeri politics and standing armies within Tamriel. As a result of the treaty, even with the help of the Dragonborn
After finding the Aetherium Forge under the ruins of Bthalft, Fjoldyar discovered that a Dwemer had be trapped in stasis, unchanging for several Eras. With the collected help of the College of Winterhold, they were able to release the Dwemer who revealed his name as Kagrenak. Kagrenak, at the moment of his release, becomes what we call the Ailtire, marking the end of the Fourth Era.

The Fifth Era
---
Immediately, where the Ailtire has made his home, he has been able to impart to us great knowledge and decrypt countless Dwemer texts. With the new-found information, Fjoldyar and Kagrenak were able to construct several sets of powerfully enchanted armors and blades out of the abundance of Aetherium that was revealed to be hidden under the ruins of Vvarenfell for use by each other and significant soldiers fighting alongside them. Dwarven metal was now just as easy as steel to forge, and quickly filled the army's supply with weapons and armor as its method was learned. The Thalmor were quickly thrown out of Tamriel in a matter of four years, however, they still threatened the seas for several more.
At this, steam could be used to power an entire metal vessal, moving at a constant speed faster than any Aldmeri ship could no matter the wind. By the sixteenth year of the fifth Era, the Aldmeri had admitted defeat. In a treaty written personally by Kagrenak and approved by the Empire and Skyrim, Skyrim and Cyrodiil became unified bodies of power, though remained in control of their respectful territories. The Aldmeri were to remain in the Summerset Isles and disband all standing armies. In exchange, they would be considered allies of Tamriel and would be taught the secrets of Dwemer technology. It's been fourty-one years since then, having since split up and ventured on their own ways. The last bit of information I have that seems mentionable is the impending coup in Morrowind between the Argonians and the Dunmer, will stay in Morrowind.

I'd like to focus more on lore, allies, and all of that story-based information here rather than the game-play mechanics. Thanks in advance for anyone who helps!

1355342839.0,14qq73,A list of Ideas i'd like to see in Elder Scrolls VI,HeroicKitten,18,5,17,"Now as an avid video game player and college student for game design I feel like I generally know what features would make a game good or not I thought up this list and think they would make the next Elder Scrolls installment even more epic than Skyrim. We all know Single player games are plagued with replay value so this is what I came up with.

**Features I want in Elder Scrolls VI**

* Deeper customization for weapons:

 *Combine rare materials for the blade, magic, etc.*

* Spellcrafting
* Better AI

 *AI that remembers
* Some kind of Multiplayer free mode

  *Just so long as I can run around and do stuff with a few friends.*
* Rare Artifacts

 For weapons and armor mostly.
* Different outcomes

 *oh I'm the dragonborne? so what I'd rather ignore  you're troubles and be a farmer (meanwhile the world goes to shit)*
* Go pure evil

 *Allow the player to choose his own destiny, and kill everyone.*
* Destroy whole towns
* Claim towns as well
* Challenge the King

 Allow the player to physically challenge the king of whatever land we are in
* Bring back Wild
* A deeper perk system not just for combat but other random

 Like half the ones from fallout (ladykiller
* Living world

 *Seasons, ice freezes ponds, etc.*
* Better romance options
* Hardcore Mode




Alright well that's my list as you can see a lot of these options for more geared towards more player freedom and I feel like that's always been the whole point to the Elder Scroll series.",self,t5_2s2ja,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/14qq73/a_list_of_ideas_id_like_to_see_in_elder_scrolls_vi/

The game opens to your character being awoken by a guard. You are in a large tent with many NPCs of all manner of races and genders. You're instructed to all stand up, Morrowind and The Black Marsh. As you get to the gate, the guard takes down your name and writes what race you are as well as which sign you were born under (this is where you choose these). After this, he tells you to that your free to go. As you pass through the gate, you find yourself on a hill, from the top of which you can see far into the distance, where the No-quin-al Desert sits between the hills of Valenwood and on the other side meets the jungles of Elsweyr. At the foot of this hill, where you can find your first quests and traders. I would like the game to take place in both sections of Tamriel.

As the game progresses, which is when the Thalmor attacked the Imperial Council and took control of White-Gold tower. While the remnants of the Empire struggle to stay alive and keep the peace in its remaining holds, It has recently been forced to fight a loosing battle in a two-front war...

We learn that Morrowind and The Black Marsh have been taken by the Akavir Alliance, they have begun their invasion of Tamriel, and they are winning. The Thalmor are using ancient, powerful magic to protect themselves from most of the Akaviri front as the Thalmor push further into Elsweyr, Valenwood and Skyrim from Cyrodiil, while the armies of Skyrim, Elsweyr

The opening of the game I described would be set in a refugee camp. The game will allow you to pick from all the normal races with their various merits, as well as all of the Akavir races being playable. This could be explained story-wise as they are defectors or ordinary citizens of the respective races just being tired of the constant fighting happening on the other continent, and all making nomadic journeys to Tamriel years before the invasion.

As far as where the story goes from there

Also, etc.) and robotic allies.
This of course are all things I'd like to see or just ideas I've had

So I had some time and decided to start over without all the gamified stuff. Disabled quest arrows from menu and ini

**Skyrim:**

After the attack on helgen, map, journal, or quest markers. 

Here are the three points at which I needed the map or journal. It is important to note that no quest markers of any kind were necessary **at any point in the whole game**.

1) Once finishing up my introductory hassles with the greybeards, but eventually found my way.

2) Couldn’t find karthspire and thus the wall of alduin without using the map to check its location. Tried journal first

3) Couldn’t find the ruins septimus sigmus directed me to to find the elder scroll without checking my map


**Dragonborn**

Most of the dialogue didn't provide enough information to get there without using either the journal or the map. Using the map, however, as the gamified map still removes from the feeling of the expanse of the game world. I must note, however, that dragonborn would have been possible to complete without the map as well, it just would have required some further exploring, which would have been too much, which aren't as providing as the main quest line.


**Did it work?**

**Yes!** This improved the experience dramatically for a somewhat patient exploration loving gamer like me. Once again, not just checkpoints along the path of the game. The world seemed expansive, not overly small as I previously thought it was. Running through the northern icy forests not knowing where the nearest city was, just like in morrowind, provided the immersion I hadn't gotten during my first playthrough. I started feeling like each place was unique instead of it all being the same, as I had thought back when I used fast travel on my first playthrough. All the nooks and crannies of the world got more interesting, and finding new roads and ways to places was an interesting experience. The whole word also felt more alive, since it now felt like exploration and finding your way somewhere

I no longer think of skyrim as the boring monotonous arrow following minigame that I used to think of it as. I now think of it as a worthy addition to the elder scrolls series.


**Things worthy of noting:**

-My skyrim was unmodded (no extended journal entries type mods)

-I did use the horse wagons that were equivalents to stilt striders in morrowind but those were few and far in between so most of the time they weren't an option.

1375877139.0,1jvmhs,Tales of Ka-Ran-Chapter 2,Nordic_King,10,0,1,"The very same Martin now lived as a priest in Kvatch, Ka-Ran new this had something to do with him, and with a new blade; Purger.

How Purger came to be, he infused the power of the stone onto his Steel Claymore, and named it Purger: for with it,  he was going to purge all Daedra from Kvatch and free its people. With his mighty blade in hand, Ka-Ran led the offensive, and took back the courtyard of Kvatch. The enchantment on his blade seemed to disintegrate any weapon his enemies were holding.

Finding Martin in the church, Ka-Ran took a soldier through the catacombs to the guards secret entrance. With him, came three Imperial Watch soldiers, who had seen Kvatch burning from the road. They were no match for the Daedra however, and fell, along with the guard who had the key. In their honor, Ka-Ran equipped the Imperial Watch Armour, and struck out the Daedra with Purger.

It came as a great shock to the Captain of the Guards when Ka-Ran twisted the handle and opened the gate. The courtyard of the castle was packed with Scamps, around the entrance of the castle. The guardsman held the court from the Daedra that continued to come. 

When he emerged, and put him out of his misery. Taking the Count's Signature Ring, he gave it to the captain of the guards. His name was forever honoured as the Hero of Kvatch. He now had to get to Martin. 

Finding Martin in the camp was easy. Delivery of him to Weynon Priory, and noticed that they were the same assassins as the ones in the prison. After disposing of them, he located Jauffre in the church itself. His face was a ghost, as he rushed past Martin and Ka-Ran.

Following him, alongside Jauffre to the blades HQ, Cloud Ruler Temple. Here Ka-Ran was appointed the role of Blade-Brother, and was an official member of the Blades. He was told to take some rest in Bruma. A quick visit to the Armoury and he wore a full set of blades armour, and wielded a Dai-Katana. 

Ka-Ran was sitting in the Bruma Inn, he struck out and attacked Ka-Ran. Pulling a dagger, Ka-Ran jabbed it between his ribs and twisted it, and he fell to the ground. Guards rushed into the Inn, and removed the body. Another man arrived before Ka-Ran, and gave him a letter before fleeing, for he had seen the attack. It read:

Greetings friend! Tidings from the Imperial City. If you get the chance
Your name has spread far and wide and you're wanted.

Honours
Grey Prince

A long trip back to the Imperial city was worth it. Here, he becomes champion, and fights off against his only friend, the Grey Prince. 

Starting as a measly pit-dog, the Foe-Hammer, an Akaviri Dai-Katana, he struck fear into everyones heart. It is said that he closed an Oblivion gate near Chorrol, and the Sigil Stone enchanted his large blade with Daedra Spirit, which made his blade do more damage then it should. Fully clad in Blades armour, he became a fierce and brutal warrior, and challenged his friend.

And that day soon came. Of his two weeks at the Arena, was an Orc at heart, and cared little for their friendship. He took it upon himself to publicly speak out, and talked of how Ka-Ran was ""just a little angry orphan, who I want nothing to do with."" Enraged, Ka-Ran stormed into the blood works and immediately challenged his only friend to a fight to the death.

The Imperial City was in uproar. The Grey Prince had been challenged! It had not happened in the last ten years. Few supported Ka-Ran, and watch his great victory. However, on the opposite, Ka-Ran kept quite, training and waiting. Until the battle began.

The fight was a large anti-climax. Ka-Ran came out charging, Ka-Ran had finished the Grey Prince. This had left the city in shock. They had lost a great hero of theirs, and gained another. After several moments of silence, the crowd cheered and cried his name. SKULL-CRUSHER!SKULL-CRUSHER! Ka-Ran left the arena and received his prize. After leaving the Arena District, Ka-Ran was approached by an Adoring Fan, who Ka-Ran dismissed. He couldn't have a small child following him around, not with what he had done. Killing his only friend? That was nothing to be proud of.

Ka-Ran treated himself to a night at the Tiber Septim Hotel. It is said that this night Ka-Ran got drunk off his head on nord mead, and headed to Bruma. He begged the Gods for forgiveness at the Altar, and Akatosh appeared to him. Ka-Ran, shocked once again, pleaded with Akatosh to forgive him. 

Akatosh spoke in a hoarse voice:
My son, as your parents originally named you. You continue to serve me in my own way, although your destiny its self is not yet clear to me. I give you my blessing, and I also give you a gift from the Gods. Until your destiny has been complete, you and your family, will age at a slow rate, so that you can have a long and peaceful life. This, should give you a long and prosperous life, Ka-Ran Skull-Crusher.Restocking his potion and repairing his weapons, and left a day after

He returned to the Tiber Septim Hotel. He spent a week here, and Ka-Ran threw him 50 septims. ""Here. Spend the night, get a drink."" Unrolling the scroll, his face dropped. It seemed he had forgotten his duties since he had came to the Arena. The Scroll Read:


Dear Ka-Ran

Your presence is required most urgently! The Blades have missed you the last 5 weeks, for Martins sake, but you are a Rogue Blade. We need you now.

Sincerely

Grandmaster Jauffre.

Padomay is **a being beyond the comprehension of mortals**, and his only equal is his 'brother', [Anu](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu), who is still trapped in the [Void](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Void). Only a being directly connected with Anu could even hope to free him from the vast nothingness in which he currently resides, and that being is Akatosh. The otherwise complacent [Aedra](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aedra) must be convinced to intervene and save the realm of Mundus. However, very few individuals possess the capabilities to commune with the Aedra

1375271355.0,1jeytx,Tales of Ka-Ran Chapter One,Nordic_King,3,2,4,"Born under the star-sign of The Warrior, abandoning his dark-elf father. At the age of 4

At the age of 6, but vanished only days later. Three weeks later, his mother passed away from a strange murderer in Riften. The murderer was a woman, who captured souls which fed her power. He was thrown into Riften Orphanage, where he spent three years. 

At the age of ten, where he was given the rich life by his parents and his foster-sister, who had also been adopted, named Lydia. Nord children they were, and therefore got into much mischief throughout the city. Lydia was three years older than Ka-Ran. He loved her dearly and took much of what he knows today from her.

At the age of 12, living under his two foster-parents, they gave him the name so he could settle in more at the Imperial City, and make some new friends. For a while, it did not seem to work however, as he would only spend his time with Lydia. Slowly, but gradually, but it changed around a lot. 

One of Samuel's best friends, and she and Samuel spends many days together. They helped each other learn basic spells, which for children of their race and age was very talented(both being nords). Occasionally, the two would go on trips together, and sit high in the mountains, and look over into their homeland of Skyrim. They would always be gone three or four days, and as much as their parents panicked for them

Unfortunately, and released a spell she had not yet perfected, and it absorbed her. She was gone forever, and Sam had lost his only friend. Depressed and alone, Sam spent the rest of his childhood only interacting with Lydia and his parents.

When he was 13, and that is the reason she left his father. He had an affair with his mothers sister, and Lydia was the outcome. Shocked by this, he immediately told Lydia, who said that she had known. Stunned yet again, she warned him that their father was not as evil as he seems.

Upon Samuel turning 16, they would both live to see old days, at least 200, and still look as fit as a fiddle. Sam spent the week crying afterwards, only to have his father approach him at the end of that week. He said few words, but burnt a symbol into Sam's hand. It was the symbol of Oblivion, but Sam had no such knowledge. His father said that he would come to learn what it meant

Now 18, the current arena champion. The Orc and Sam shared many qualities, including their favouritism of heavy weapons and armour. When returning to his mansion one day, he found his parents dead, with their bodies strung up in his living room. He was wrongly accused of their murder, and sent to the Imperial Prison for life. He had spent two years in the cell, dreaming of revenge against his parents murderers. One day, a voice that Sam had not heard before...

""You..You're the one from my dreams."" Was the current emperor, only to met again with Uriel soon.


Sam decided to return to his name of Ka-Ran, Uriel convinced his guards to trust Ka-Ran. Ka-Ran had no idea what the emperor saw in him, for he was but a young nord, who had not even come of age yet. What came as a shock to Ka-Ran was the fact that the emperor appeared to know of his hand symbol, and told him that it was the symbol of the Oblivion dimension, which he would soon see with his own eyes. Then, one of the assassins hunting the emperor appeared and sliced him down. With his dying breath, and told him where to take it. Jauffre

Baurus rushed into the small room to see his emperor dead. He heard out Ka-Ran and gave him the key to the sewers. He said that he should hurry to Weyon Priory to meet with Jauffre. But before he departed the imperial city

Having no money or belongings, or Agronak gro-Malog, as is his formal name. Upon arrival, Agronak was pleased to see his friend free and well. He could offer no aid to him, but encouraged him to fight in the arena.

Ka-Ran fought two battles in the arena, with the gold found in the caves and gold won at the arena. He departed and set out to Weyon Priory, where he would deliver the amulet of kings to the Grandmaster of the blades.

The trip to Weynon Priory near Chorrol was quite easy for the young nord. He had been in wilderness before, and on a windy Turdas night he was summoned into Uriel's quarters, where he was delivered a small baby child named Martin, and told to keep him safe.

The very same Martin now lived as a priest in Kvatch, before heading off on his next trip. ",,False,self,t5_2s2ja,False,,

Why can we only have Horses as mounts? Sure we had a dragon but I was thinking more along the lines of land mounts. 

For an example

Now to make these mounts unique in their own way they'd have to have different stats.

A horse could be the base Mount, and Agility could all be mediocre. But it's Stamina would be the best of the four.

The Saber Cat's Agility would be vastly greater than all of the mounts

Now the wolf's speed would be greatest. But it's strength and Agility would be average. However

The Bear, his Speed, and Stamina would be lacking in comparison to all of the other mounts. Having the Agility a bit better than a Wolf, but much worse than the Saber Cat.

The Thalamor have secured their hold over the entire land of the tamriel except in certain bastions scattered around the world where resistance is fierce.

They even have managed to enslave dragons using some secret magical device unknown to the world.  Thalamor Dragon Riders Patrol the sky

You start as a prisoner in one of these camps either to be scheduled for purging due to for the crime of not being an elf or something else.  

After that you discover that even though the thalamor have stopped the worship of talos he still has power. This pisses them off greatly. So either you join the thalamor and continue to enforce their will. Destroying resistance

1358623520.0,16w09d,What would you like to see in The Elder Scrolls 6?,ElrondTheHalfElven,2,3,1,"With the most recent reply to a similar thread being one month ago

A huge focus of mine is with how I would like the storyline to go, or Hammerfell. Here's why - As we progress further and further through the TES storyline, I am getting progressively more anxious to deal with Aldmeri Dominion war once and for all. And what better place to take the fight to than The Summerset Isles, or a neighoburing province (Hammerfell, for example, where according to dialouge I have heard in Skyrim, wars against the Thalmor still rage on that I am very anxious to take part in)? The Aldmeri dispute is a complicated and interesting part of the universal storyline that I am completely confident would make a great equivalent to Skyrim's civil dispute in the next Elder Scrolls title. That being said, I would not deem it wise to put an end to the whole thing just yet
This storyline is one that intrigues me greatly, expasive desters and beautiful coastline of Hammerfell, or the deep, mystifying forests of Valenwood would suffice as well. 

Other things I would love to see: 

-Less loading screens upon entering different buildings and areas. 
Let's admit that though it was not a great nuisance, and also because of the significant hardware improvements included in the next generation of consoles.

- The ability to travel between provinces. 
I cannot count the number of times I have wished for the ability to travel freely to neighboring provinces in past Elder Scrolls titles. Once I am used to the experience of life in one province, of course would be in Skyrim. Traveling to the very borders of Morrowind, Cyrodiil, and Hammerfell, only to be restricted by an invisible wall, and taunted by the very sight of a land with so many wonders to discover, is not the greatest feeling. And turning off collisions and running through feels neat at first, I know that I'm not really there. I cannot tell you what a wonder it would be to be able to walk through one of those borders one day, and that they will take advantage of the capabilities of the new generation of gaming platforms

- More NPC's
I think we can all speculate just how much more life would be brought into the world with the presence of more NPC's. As amazing as Skyrim is (being my current favorite video game in fact), spontaneous battles between bands of traveling Stormcloaks and Imperials, or more frequent appearances of hunting parties tracking and killing animals for example. Things like that would no-doubt liven up the environment, and make for a great overall feel of being in occupied and civilized lands. And so, I cannot hope enough to see that in TES 6. How great would it be to be walking in the wild near a roadside, and see a whole troop of Thalmor marching in unison to their destination, but then confronted by surprise by a group of (whichever faction is the rebels in that game), or watch how the battle plays out.

These are the main things that I think would help make The Elder Scrolls 6 a truly amazing game. Tell me what you think if you'd like.


EDIT: I have come to the conclusion that The Summerset Isles would probably be best left to the Finale of the series. I do not think the Thalmor should just be flat-out eliminated in the next game, and the regaining of the Strength of The Empire (thanks in part to your role in the story, of course). I have decided that I would really love for the next installment to be set mainly in Hammerfell. Since they are still standing tall against the Thalmor by continuing the war with them in Hammerfell, I think that Hammerfell could be a great setting in which to significantly weaken the Thalmor, but not to finish them off just yet. I would absolutely love to fight alongside the soldiers of Hammerfell, bringing down troops of Thalmor on the hot desert sand. That would be absolutely amazing.

Don't like:

Second, I don't mean that the design sucks.  And I'm not *just* talking about the fact that it's clearly designed for a controller, and not for a keyboard.  But there are certain things like, for example, choosing dialogue options.  I'll click on a dialogue option and it'll play the wrong one - apparently since I need to both scroll to the right dialogue option AND make sure it's highlighted, or something.  

Also, I'll never know.  

Like: 

Boss battles!  In Oblivion, but that was rather anticlimactic.  But I love the fact that you battle an ice troll before heading into High Hrothrim, for example.  And of course, the dragons themselves are bosses.  I felt this was a big part of what was missing in Oblivion, as it just seemed to be wave after wave of humanoid enemies.
