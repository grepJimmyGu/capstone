1. Apply hair conditioner
2. Rinse

Sorry to gross everyone out this morning, I feel the need to shout from the rooftops. 

For those of you who are like ""Wha?"", I would develop a fish-like smell downtown. It's not the sort of thing (to the best of my knowledge) that anyone not intimately involved with my genitalia would notice, but sometimes I, you know, want someone to be intimately involved. No amount of soaping or scrubbing (or, as I also experimented, just rinsing) would make it go away. It usually lasted a day or two. Having been a 20-year-old virgin

It seems to basically come down to pH. Both sexy time fluids and soap raise the pH on the surface of your skin

I remembered reading somewhere that hair conditioner is designed to correct the pH of your hair (for different reasons), so give it a try if you happen to share my problem.

I am a fairly hairy guy and never really took care of grooming in my life. Grooming history: I would often have to shave facial hair and occasionally

Lack of Grooming history: however

Thus

1) What does [/r/malegrooming](/r/malegrooming) recommend as a body shaver since I have experience only in razors? (especially if one need to shave parts like armpits

2) Should I leave parts unshaven? I seem posts about chest hair and how you should not be embarrassed about it. Does the same go for armpits? legs? 

3) How does one go about shaving parts like armpits, groin, ass)? Trim it (same parts)? I am thinking about only trimming ""downtown"" areas, but how much should I trim off? Being a fairly hairy guy, I am afraid of trimming too much and it looking odd compare to the rest of my body. 

4)* How much should I shave/trim and the other half leave alone due to a natural hairy body?

5) I have back hair....should I get it professionally waxed or is there another way?

TL;DR - a fairly hairy and embarrassed guy trying to get a beginner's guide to male grooming and to trim his wild and hairy body.

Thank you for the advice

----------------------------------

Everything else in our relationship is near perfect. We've been dating for several years now, physically.

I've tried to talk to him gently about it, which makes his hair frizzy and damaged.. I've tried buying them for him since he says he doesn't know what to get, but that doesn't seem to matter.

He won't use any sorts of lotions or anything (because ""it's gay/girly"")

He's also gaining quite a bit of weight, but this is becoming a bit much. He has acknowledged this as an issue, but won't change it either.)

I was tempted to post this into AskReddit

Please help? Any ideas on how to approach this?

Edit: Thank you very much, and a concern of mine, then I can casually explain that his lack of grooming is going along with it. This way I hope it won't sound to him like ""You're disgusting, and ugly, and don't touch me.""

I have been getting my downstairs waxed for the last year or so, everything feels natural instead of extra dry, and it is good for your skin instead of damaging. I have recently switched over to coconut oil instead of baby oil, but either one will work great. Baby oil is probably easier to start with getting the right amount.

Start with only a drop or two, a very very thin coat rubbed in pretty well will suffice. You shouldn't feel particularly oily, but even if you do it will fade pretty quickly.

FOR STARTERS:

1. The first thing you need to do when you wake up is to drink a cup of water

2. After putting toothpaste on your brush, as well as the backsides, lightly on the inner cheeks and tongue. (Clench your non-dominant hand to prevent gagging). Preferably use an electric toothbrush, you should brush from 1:30-2:00 minutes.

3. Floss between gaps and around teeth.

4. Mouthwash for 90 seconds

SHOWER:

5. Now it's time to shower! If you brush in the shower, rinse, conditioner (optional).

6. Put your soap/body wash into a wash cloth and wash your chest, back, lower-body (ahem), legs, and feet last. Soap that cloth up again and rinse it. 

7. Dry off your body first from your face to your legs, then your nether region, THEN between the toes. Feet should be the last things you dry.

SHAVING:

8. Now is the perfect time to shave. Use a facial scrub and then put on the foam. Shave, eye cream (vaseline works great), and lip balm. 

MISC:

9. Clean your ears with Q-tips. It's disgustingly awesome how much better and cleaner I can feel and hear after doing so. (Yes

10. Put on your anti-perspirant. In my experience, it works great for me and my girlfriend goes crazy for it. 

Products I use:

Oral-B toothbrush, American Crew volumizing shampoo when short, Head and Shoulders Sport when long, Gillette moisturizing body wash when ordinary, Bath and Body Works Oak when fancy, Gillette Pro-Glide power with warming facial scrub, clear shave gel, microbial Q-tips

Thickeners and emulsifiers (Stearic Acid

1343419906.0,x9jhx,How I Conquered Folliculitis (Backne),groomdude,34,6,9,"For years I have struggled with my self-confidence about the skin on my back. Many years ago when I was in middle school, but the blotches, I dreaded swimming in fear that people would see and judge. I know people who had it worse and I know a lot of people (guys/girls) struggle with it just like facial acne

1) General: Essentially, scratch, pop, etc. Try to keep that skin CLEAN and free from more irritation.

2) Linens/Clothes: Make sure everything you spend the day in/wrap yourself in is clean. Yes, I personally have always worn white cotton undershirts and looking back, this was a great preventative step. They were always clean until I got sweaty or slept in them. Wear a clean shirt in the day time and CHANGE YOUR SHIRT into something clean to sleep in. You sweat when you sleep so, yes, opt for an old cotton t-shirt. Don't ask me about which fabrics, I always wear cotton t-shirts or undershirts and it did the trick. If you are sweating throughout the day/applying sunscreen/etc. change your shirt midday and maybe shower to clean off.

3) Shower: Hot water opens your pores. I think this was a MAJOR contributor to why my folliculitis lingered; I took long

4) Sun exposure: I live in an area where it gets really hot and sunny in the spring/summer, try to get a little safe tan going once a week, it'll help a lot.

5) Products/Meds: I actually did go to the derm once I hit high school and he diagnosed my folliculitis. He put me on some Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) cream and wash stuff for the shower along with some doxycycline. In retrospect, was doxycycline makes you VERY vulnerable to the sun's rays and after being on a medium dose of it for years, i got burnt easy and my face always looked red. I probably developed some rosacea or something from it. Look into it and talk to a doctor. As for products, a small tube of BP can be applied to spots before you sleep and they'll generally help keep big whiteheads down. I kept a cleanser in the shower and used it every other day. It helps, but can dry your skin out. I found a great Clean &amp; Clear moisturizer that also has salicylic acid in it and would put that on after I (cold!) shower. I saw improvement quickly. Try to use them every other day, though as you will blow through them quickly, but you can also dry your skin out quickly. I recommend some lotion (I used some ""repairing"" vaseline lotion) and apply it over your back/body 1-2 times a day. Just doing that alone actually cleared up my arms a great deal.

6) Water. Drink a lot of it. Aim for half your body weight in fluid ounces. It helps not only your skin

Well, but if you are on a tight budget and want to conquer the folliculitis yourself I recommend at the very least taking cold showers, drinking a lot of water, changing your shirts, and using lotion. Those alone I think helped ~50%. Persistence is key! I hope this guide helps and I'd be willing to answer any PM's or replies. Thanks for reading!

Before we get started

* I am not a doctor - please don’t consider this medical advice

* You need to do this on an “off” day. If you have a hot date tonight with anyone but your hand

* Veet is much better

* If you are super-concerned about your “sensitive skin” put a dob on a spot in your armpit and give it a test run.

Ok

* Get yourself some 3 or 4 minute lotion. I go with the “Aloe and Lanolin” version.

* Bring your smart phone or

* Do not shower beforehand.

* Do not warm up the Nair.

* Your sack needs to be dry. Like arid desert dry.

The Nair needs to go on thick, but if it’s 200 degrees out, you’re going to have to cover more ground. My suggestion would be getting the air conditioner to blow directly on your sack, which will not only dry that swamp out, but reduce the surface area that you have to cover. Barring that, I guess a fan would work.
For determining the amount of Nair I use

It is important that you do it right the first time. You cannot re-Nair

Set that bottle down and use your dominant hand to scoop up and apply the Nair. It needs to go on about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Do not rub it in - just spread it like you’re icing a cupcake. It’s not a race, you’ve exhausted the majority of your Nair, and you can use that non-dominant hand to prop your unit up so the skin isn’t overlapping and squishing out the Nair at the top of your sack.

I try to avoid getting the Nair on my legs, I end up standing like [this](http://www.vinow.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/captain_morgan.jpg) with one foot on the toilet, trying not to have my junk rub up against my leg.

Wash your hands in cold water

Once this is all completed, and you have at least 5 minutes to kill. Keep calm, relax. If you can stand like a flamingo for 7+ minutes without cramping, I say go for it.
Start up the shower, and then turn the heat down slightly. If the water is warm enough to loosen your sack up, it’s too warm. 

Hop in the shower. Ignore the soap. This is a rinse, and will make you a Youtube star. Once you’re satisfied that you have removed 99% of it, you should be able to ever-so-slightly pull on any remaining hair, and it will come right out. I usually have to do this for the spot where my rod meets my sack.

Make sure you PAT your junk dry. There is obviously a small amount of Nair residue left on your sack, you can resume normal operation. 

This usually keeps my sack squeaky clean for 2 weeks, so you can squeeze out another week and a half before you have to repeat the ritual.

In Mis-Match, and hopefully it’ll help you make a decision as to whether or not a product is worth your money and time!

This week’s suggestions came from this thread on Reddit: Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser

Thanks to ejas4816, Picture_me_this, demifool, and Autopack for suggestions! Sorry I wasn’t able to get to all of them. I’m going to try to pick the most widely available products and will cover more products in  time.

**Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser**

**The Claim**

Cetaphil® Gentle Skin Cleanser is great for daily makeup removal. Originally formulated for dermatologists, teens and adults.

**The Ingredients**

Water, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben.

(Listed in decreasing quantity)

**The Cost**

$0.63 US per fluid ounce on Amazon

**What is it?**

Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is a cream/gel cleanser. It is made up water

Cetyl alcohol, white liquid.

Propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate act as solvents and surfactants. Propylene glycol, attracting moisture to the surface of the skin as well. Sodium lauryl sulfate is a standard surfactant, it binds to both water and oil. It binds to the oil on your skin, emulsifies (mixes) it with water and is then easily rinsed away with water. It’s the same surfactant that is commonly used in foaming cleansers.

Methylparaben, meaning it can increase your chance of sun damage and sun burn. Parabens as preservative are used in very small amounts, however, and are extremely effective which is why they’re still used so commonly.

**The Match-Up**

“…great for daily makeup removal?” Yup! This is due to the propylene glycol, even water and a cotton pad will remove a good percentage of the makeup, the three ingredients mentioned just help make it easier! Due to its ingredients though, you may have a trickier time removing silicone based make up.

“…gentle on your skin and sensitive to your skin’s need” Yup! Cetaphil is definitely gentle, but rest assured that the dissolving of oils and the mechanical rubbing action is good enough to remove bacteria, oil and dirt from the skin. Foamy doesn’t always mean clean!

“…will not strip the skin of natural protective oils or emollients” Uhh. The nature of a cleanser IS to remove oils and emollients from the skin. The deposition however of the propylene glycol and cetearyl alcohol on your skin might make your skin feel more moisturized

“…will not disturb the skin’s natural pH balance.” Uhh. There are no pH modifiers in the product, your skin returns to it’s normal pH after cleansing usually within an hour.

“fragrance-free and non-comedogenic.” Yup! Definitely fragrance free. None of the ingredients in the product will clog your pores either

“gentle enough for children

**The Verdict: Match!**

Give Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser a try if you have dry or sensitive skin. Though in reality everyone can use it, but the ingredients it doesnt – like fragrances, extracts, and dyes. You can often find cheaper generic versions of this with the exact same ingredients at the drugstore!

In the shower

- Hair  (It's really thick and really straight.)
 
 -  No name shampoo

 - Aussie mega conditioner

- No name shower gel for everywhere else except face
 - Was gonna grab Kyoku for Men Daily Facial Cleanser and Exfoliating Facial Scrub as the reviews were good. Is this something you use in the shower
 - I have some spots on my back/shoulder area

- I use Avene Cicalfate Repair Cream on my face straight after I get out the shower when the pores are open from the heat

- What is a good general body moisturiser/other product that's good to slap on after you dry yourself of once your out the shower?

- When cleaning my teeth I use a standard whitening toothpaste

- I have (unintentionally...) got the same hair cut as [Ridiculously Photogenic Guy](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/754/AnBWa.jpg) and wear it kinda like that; just push it to the side and off my forehead. I use KMS California Hairplay Clay Creme

**Though-out the day**

- I've read that keeping your hands off your face is a good way to avoid getting outbreaks. I have a cheep alcohol based hand wash (just rub it into your hands without water) on my desk just in case I get something on them. Would just using this though out the day be a good way of keeping your hands cleaner and therefore not moving as much dirt to your face when they do touch? What other products are good?

**Evening**

- I've heard that washing your hair too much can be bad for it so in the shower after the gym I don't use anything on it and just give it a good scrub with my hands. Good idea

- When I get back home

- Are there any products on the market that are like the ""herb-mint facial mask"" which Patrick Beteman uses during the [morning routine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVpRzw2eRlg#t=57) in American Psycho which you can peel off? It looks really fun!

Being sterile is key!  I try not to have too much peroxide on my face, I also dip the razor in the peroxide before and after shaving strokes (and wash in water after dipping in the peroxide).  My razor burn and pimples have cut down dramatically.

If I can, or you just irritate the skin.  If it's a really nasty pimple, pop it, and then try back a few hours/day later.  It's really tempting to overdo it, so use it wisely

If I'm going to stay in

If I'm going out

Take an advil/ibuprofen and break it open. I place the open tablet on the pimple.  I then will add a few drops of an eye redness remover

Finally, as if you try to put a lot on, then it will look like you are wearing makeup (as many things, less is more, and ends up looking better).  The goal of the moisturizer is to even out your skin, not hide every flaw (and it has SPF protection!).  You can be amazed on how having an ""even"" complexion makes you look pretty damn good!

Specifically from one side of the chest to the other when the color of the hair matches the pubes but no other hair on your body--though hair on head has always been light brown.

I'm 24, have been very dark black. That line down from my belly button (about 1-2"" wide, that most guys get) has been dark black for years but recently it has widened to the whole front of my chest below the belly button. Basically like the color of my pubes are slowly taking over and darkening my chest from the front up.

I honestly wouldn't care, especially when I trim below and don't do anything about the lower chest hair, I feel it looks really weird--almost like my pubes cover my entire lower chest. Maybe it's just me because it's still a new change, but it is very noticeably different from the rest of my chest and everywhere else.

I have been trying to think of the best way to do this, so a lot of conventional shaving went right out the window. 

*Also

So far I have the following ideas. It's not much

* Get some kind of tape and cut it out in the letters desired
* Do the exact opposite
* Somehow use Nair... although I may regret saying that. 
* I have no idea what kind of grooming devices are out there

That's all I've got. Please help me r/malegrooming!

Right now with the bushy vacation beard I look like a neonazi so whatever I do I figure it's going to have to be short and neat. My persona is the complete opposite of the tough guy skinhead and as it is now I look like a biker on his way to a klan meeting.

First off for hair, I think its the 5 centimeter cutter. I'm new to the whole thing so Idk if the cutters are the same for every trimmer.

My skin dries easily especially on my hands and since I work in fast food I have to keep washing my hands. How do I keep the skin around my nails from opening, I know I'm not explaining it right but I'm not sure what the white stuff in the pores are. Ive put lotion on it and around my nose but only the dry skin clears with it, whatever is coming out of the pores stays.

As for acne, whatever come from. My face clears with drinking water and splashing cold water on my face at night but I have some acne on my back, not a lot but its a couple. They are mostly on the upper part of my back. I want to know how to get that off.

When I was in highschool I started developing very bad acne.  I ended up taking Accutane, I had to carry moisturiser on me at all times.  That only lasted a couple of years.  Nowadays, I no longer get acne, but my face is really shiny looking.  It's been this way for a long time, and sometimes it makes me embarrassed to look at myself in the mirror, and when someone takes a picture of me using a flash it's like a beacon.

I've tried several things when looking for advice online.  I tried washing my face twice a day with a cleanser

I'd noticed when I get out of the shower after just washing my face my forehead would look extra shiny, just ran water over it in the shower.  Still no.  Even with moisturising.

I've taken vitamin B pills

I'm really tired of looking like a greasy monstrosity.  You might be able to tell that it really shatters my self esteem.  I'm pleading for some help.

- face wash every day

- face moisturiser everyday with spf+15/30
- wash cloth/sponge

- Hair conditioner every day

- Face moisturiser every day

My hair has been thinning extremely fast on top lately and I know i'm going to close to bald in the next year. I'm trying to come to terms with it the best i can. I am hoping to get some feedback on how i would look and what I should do. I've read comments in the past here about ""balding in general"" that its better to own it by buzzing it down real short and eventually shaving it. Would a buzzed or completely shaved cut look good on me? Please tell me if both would or wouldn't look good. What things i can do to help.

A little background: I don't have a particularly hairy back - it’s patchy in places but the hairs are rather coarse. Getting my top off in public like at the beach and whatnot was something I avoided because of it, as my hairy back remained patchy, but with slightly bald patches in the patchy hair that grew back pretty quickly.

Second attempt was at shaving - now you can imagine how that went.....very much like the hair removal cream and didn't last long at all. Failure 2.

Thirdly

Now these turned into big-ol' spots and I had to wait for 3 weeks for them all to heal properly (which was incidentally the exact amount of time it took for my back hair to grow back) FAIL NUMBER 3...

Which brings me neatly to today. I had my epilator

At that point I decided to switch it up, for lack of a better word.

Since that time

When I began with this new hairstyle I would have a round shape at the front

Either way

Is this from constant combing and running my fingers through my hair (to keep it back)? Is it from lack of shampoo? I read that people noticed an improvement in the condition of their hair without shampoo. My hair isn't dirty by any means, but could this still be the reason?

As far as baldness in the family... My dad is in his 60s and has a respectable amount of hair. One of my grandads was mostly bald from what I remember, has been balding for some time now. He is five years older than me and has some serious power alleys, and his crown is pretty faded. But at the same time, when he was my age he had been noticably balding already, whereas my case has suddenly appeared.

Is this permanent and ongoing? Should I be concerned? Is there a chance this is kind of a ""phase"" and my hair can grow back?

This service is $20/month which I think is reasonable based on what I received this month. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/xupEw) is a link to the album of the contents from my box. I had 5 items in my box. [Here](http://www.birchbox.com/men/) is the website for Birchbox if you want to investigate it. If you do decide to sign up and would like to give me credit

* The box itself is very compact and does not waste packing material.
* On top is a card listing the contents, this month is summer inspiration. 
* The backside of the card has a recipe for a Michelada (Mexican spicy beer cocktail-try it) and a little story about Abe Lincoln.
* The first item is a Wrapster from Quirky. It is used to help keep your earbuds wrapped in a clean manner and can also serve as a stand for your iPhone. I like the blue and will probably get a lot of use out of this. Retails for $7.
* Next up
* Next is a pre-shave oil sample from John Allan called Slickwater. A full size version retails for $29 for 2 oz. This sample, cucumber, oats, Vitamin A &amp; C. Smells really good too.
* Moving on
*  Lastly

So I received 2 full sized products and 3 sample size. Each of the samples should allow quite a few uses so I'm happy with that. Overall

Please leave any questions or comments about this summary, any comments or tips on formatting and whether you would like me to continue doing these. I've also posted this in 4 subreddits to see which one really responds so I won't have to post to so many places if I continue.

I want (need) some guidance with regards to personal hygiene.
I haven't really had something that just lays out the basics

If there's a better/more appropriate subreddit for this let me know. 

My current situation: I'm male

I just started actually shaving my face. I have some Gillette shaving pack that came with a razor
deodorant
&gt; What should I know about shaving stuff? 

&gt; Is there a proper way to shave? 

&gt; Are there some things I should watch out for? (E.g. 'Don't shave upwards' or 'Only go so far up by your ears' etc...)

&gt; Does one kind of razor perform better than another? 

I get a hair cut only when I have to (last time was 2 years ago).

&gt; I don't know anything about getting my hair cut.

&gt; I don't know what to ask for. I don't know what to look for. 

&gt; I don't know what things to consider when choosing a hair style.

&gt; Is there a real difference between a cheap hair cut or an expensive one?

&gt; How often does one get a hair cut?

I brush my teeth about once a day.

&gt; Does the type of tooth paste matter at all?

&gt; Is there a preferred tooth brush? (I have some electric one I got at CVS)

&gt; Perhaps some other tips? (I do make a once over specifically for the gum-tooth border)

I shower about 2 or 3 times a week. 

&gt; Better shampoo/conditioners? 

&gt; I've heard/read things about not using shampoo each time? Why not? Should I also skip conditioner? 

&gt; Body wash? 

And for all of the above:

&gt; Is there anything else I should know/consider? 

Basically I've been doing about the minimum required to not appear homeless.

1350950657.0,11wv14,"My Story: A battle with seborrhea and possible solution to acne, rosacea, dry, itchy skin, eczema, etc on the face. xpost from /r/skincareaddiction",0

I'm writing today because I see so many articles looking for help with a variety of skin problems. I hope this will help some of you who have **acne, eczema-like conditions, rosacea, dermatitis, brandy nose etc**. Since it was an article posted here that helped me so much, I wanted to share my experience with you.

Let's start with some information about me. I'm currently 27 years old, no allergies. I eat well, and try to take care of my skin, though not so rigorously as some of you. Overall, I'm healthy. I haven't gone to a general doctor in... well I don't know. I'm not much of a natural remedy person; I'd go for the prescription medicine over the vitamin/herbal route any day.

It was roughly three years ago that I started to notice dry skin on my face. It began on my cheeks to either side of my nostrils. At first

The most affected area of my face was in the creases next to my nostrils, petroleum jelly, cleaning with an astringent, steroid creams, etc. Some things helped temporarily but never for long. I noticed some other peculiarities: symptoms were milder when I changed my pillowcase often, intensity would come in cycles - good for a week or so then a breakout, some treatments would help for a while then I'd have a breakout, but my case looked a lot like the example here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seborrhoeic_dermatitis.jpg

After several months and worsening conditions, and extremely itchy (think poison ivy). I tried to moisturize and not to scratch. Everyone noticed the problem, and I was going out of my mind. I finally made an appointment with a dermatologist for the following week. That evening or the next day I tried using a dandruff shampoo on my face. After a few minutes dead skin rinsed off like I was molting. That week the condition was the best it had been in months, though not completely gone.

At my dermatologist appointment, I found out that the causes of seborrhea are not very well understood. Various sources listed diet, bacteria, fungus, immune problems and genetics as things that caused or resulted in an excess of sebum causing seborrhea. Most resources agreed that it is a chronic problem that only seems to go away when your body decides it's time. This was somewhat disheartening, but I figured I'd see how well the prescription worked.

The sulfacetamide did well to control my seborrhea. I never had another bad breakout. It stunted the flakiness and moisturized my skin enough that after my morning regimen no one noticed the condition on my face. For three years I was content with the results and I came to terms with the fact that I'd be using a prescription cream in the long term.

In May of this year, it did not last. A week or two after I got home the seborrhea came back and my hopes were dashed.

In the following months my face got progressively (but very slowly) worse. Or maybe it was just that I had gotten a glimmer of hope and then was dissatisfied with my current results. Maybe it was actually that the prescription was expired. Maybe it was that I started wearing glasses and the nosepieces were in constant contact with my skin. In any case

Same deal. Seborrhea/rosacea. How's it working? You satisfied? Yeah, this turned out to be very good news. I spent the entire afternoon at work researching demodex. I read reference works, results of studies, first person accounts. The more I read, the more I was convinced this was the problem. Everything started to add up. Breakouts that seemed to come in cycles, symptoms affected by how often I changed my bedding, clearing up while on vacation; these were things I noticed. Sources also described symptoms I hadn't noticed like enlarged pores. I explained about me at the beginning of this write-up so that you'd know I'm not a hypochondriac. But I was confident that was I had experienced for three years was finally explained.

I found this website: [demodexsolutions.com](http://www.demodexsolutions.com/). Perhaps like me, I decided it's trustworthy enough.

I went home and performed the test as they suggested. I had a microscope in the basement and took a sample of sebum from 8-10 of my pores. I found 4 demodex mites

It took about two weeks for my package to come

**I am not affiliated with www.demodexsolutions.com**

That site claims **""Adolescent acne is for 90% caused by Human Demodex mites, acne rosacea, some other kinds of rosacea, brandy nose, widened large pores, itching face and scalp, itching eyelashes and eyebrows plus other demodex related skin problems.""** I only had seborrhea and rosacea, that would be 45% of acne sufferers that could easily be treated. **Breakouts that come in cycles and changes in routine that cause breakouts are a good indicator of demodex.**

I don't know why western doctors don't admit that demodex can be a problem. I've read that they are taught that demodex are naturally occurring and cause no skin problems. But more and more studies are suggesting that this is false. In my case

This mask is great before going out

**What you’ll need:**

2 teaspoons cocoa powder

2-4 uncoated aspirin pills (grinded up)

A few drops of water to make the above a paste

Alternatives: Try mixing the cocoa powder and grinded up aspirin pills with yogurt or substitute the cocoa entirely with plain yogurt.

**How it works**

Aspirin

Cocoa powder contains antioxidants and flavanols

The cocoa in this mask is really just a carrier for the aspirin powder. You can substitute plain yogurt

I personally find that the cocoa absorbs like a clay mask

**It’s super easy to make:**

1. Grind up the uncoated aspirin pills in a pestle and mortar
2. Add in the cocoa powder
3. Finally mix in a few drops of water until it gets to a spreadable consistency (It helps to use an eye dropper to do this

**Tip!** If you do end up liking this mask

**How to use it**

Spread it on gently and give it 15 minutes or more to do its magic! The majority of it should be on your cheeks

To remove, scrubbing can cause small tears in your skin possibly leading to infections and acne.

Use it for special occasions
