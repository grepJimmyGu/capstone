**AppleTV**",,t5_2rfbh,1356558442.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/15gpaq/welcome_new_apple_owners_to_save_you_time/
1356372288.0,15ds5s,Ex-Genius guide to troubleshooting.,ICasual,128,13,42,"After reading the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/15cq45/i_guess_ill_be_that_guy/) on /r/apple about how little help there is on this sub

###About me

I worked at Apple as a ""Genius"" for several years in the early 2000's and now am part owner in my own Apple Consulting firm. 

###Software Problems

##Finding the cause

Most of the work I did at Apple and do at my current job when confronted with a problem was not trying to fix the issue. The real helpful part is finding where the issue is.

OS X has an easy time rebuilding files that it needs. More often than not

##User or System

Almost all software issues fall into problems with files within the User or System folder. A very quick and easy thing to try is to create a new user and see if the same issue you're having is happening there. 

If it does

##Libraries or Library

If your issue doesn't happen in the new user

A few apps, your problem is probably there. (Press and hold option again and choose your old library.)

All apps create a file on your Mac that keep track of how you like things setup. (Window size, open the Library. Open the Preferences folder and find the App in question. (It will be named in the following way: com.company.app, for instance, com.apple.iTunes) Move that file to the desktop (backup!) and remove it from the Preference folder. Open the app and see if it works. If not, but the backup file back. 

###Hardware Problems

Similar to the user/system steps with software issues


##Hard Drive

An external drive with a copy of OS X installed has helped me more than anything else. If your computer is acting slow

##Safe Boot/Mode

Turn on your Mac and immediately hold down the shift key. Let go when you see the spinning gear or the progress bar appear below the Apple logo. This will scan your Mac for file system issues (and try to fix them). It will allow boot your computer with a lot of things can could cause problems disabled. (DVD Player, USB modem, WiFi...) If your Mac isn't booting, this can help you backup files before doing a reinstall. Reboot the Mac to get out of safe mode. 

##Other hardware

Some of these things might seem obvious

Video looks distorted? Try an external monitor/TV. Or take a screen shot. If the other device or screen shot is distorted

Sound not working? Try headphones or speakers. Also

###If it seems like you've tried everything

I see these listed on the right

##PMU reset##

This is a quick reset to a small component of your Mac that hold small amounts of data. Resetting this can help with more random issues than I can list here. This won't hurt anything

Restart your Mac. Press and hold the following keys: command, r.

Keep them held down until you hear the Mac startup sound once or twice. Let go and let it boot up. 

##SMC reset##

Another random step to try is to reset the SMC. Again

Shut down your Mac then follow the next steps for what kind of computer you have.

#Desktops: Unplug the power cable. Wait 15 seconds. Plug it back in. Wait 5 seconds before pressing power to boot. 
#Laptops with removable batteries: Unplug from power cable. Take out battery. Press and hold power button for 5 seconds. Reconnect battery and boot normally.
#Laptops without removable batteries: Plug in the power cable. Press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time. Let go of all the keys at the same time. Boot normally.

We are ill-equipped to answer questions about or handle the issues that *will arise* from using beta software

**Please be aware that questions or comments that violate this rule will most likely be deleted.**

The good news is that there are subreddits which can help with all of your questions on these unsupported circumstances. Try a visit to /r/jailbreak, /r/illegaltorrents, or /r/iphone for help on these particular topics. If you have questions about illegal activities, don't bother asking any of these subreddits for help. They won't respond well.

I put it in the dishwasher, and I didn't let it go through the dry cycle. I used the shortest ""delicate china"" setting on my dishwasher. After I took it out, I put it in a large plastic bag filled with instant rice, put it on a shelf and totally forgot about it for about three weeks. There was some rice dust all over the board, but I just vacuumed it and then blasted it with canned air.

I've searched ""water"" on here for help

I came on my keyboard and I've wiped off some of it but I fear that there's still some that will seep through and damage my macbook. 

Is that a possibility?

Am I fucked?

What should I do?

EDIT: Thank you guys for all the help. I used to have a clear protector thing, it's different from water and should dry out. Well, it seems fine. I just had a little scare.

Sparrow.",GentleCanadianFury,0, though nowhere near as drastic (only a few seconds instead of minutes) when App Resume has to operate on any application that has a menu bar component.  As such


**Edit 2: For you devs out there


**Edit 3: For funsies, and reboot.  The result is that Sparrow itself still takes a long time to load up, but it doesn't impact the loading of the rest of the login items.  There is definitely an issue with the implementation of App Resume.  I will be updating the Radar filing accordingly.**

For a long time now, but I was having the same problem with my work iMac, which I do power down every night.  I knew that whatever was causing the problem was something common to both computers, and I had a few minutes of free time this morning, so I decided to do a little bit of experimenting to see what was causing the problems.

**My process**:

The first thing I did was to quit every single application and remove every single login item from Users &amp; Groups for my account.  This, and everything was up and running in a heartbeat, as it should be.

So I systematically started re-introducing every single one of my login items

At this point, I tried starting up apps, then rebooting to see how they interfered with load times.  First Safari.  Reboot with Safari running and a few Reddit tabs open.  Not an issue.  Terminal + TotalTerminal.  No problem.  Reeder.  Not an issue.

Then

Obviously, controlling my system is almost 100% dictated by my ability to use Alfred, Found, TextExpander, and Keyboard Maestro.  So the fact that these processes are hung up for almost a minute when I'm on an SSD-based Mac is so incredibly frustrating.  Even worse is the fact that this isn't due to a conflict with other login items.  It's the result of an App Resume interfering with my login items.  So despite the fact that these four key applications are the first four in my list of login items, Sparrow is still pulling rank and trying to load up before them.  Admittedly, this probably isn't Sparrow's fault; I'd imagine it's the way the App Resume mechanic built in to the OS works.  But knowing this, so I know how difficult these things can be

Anyway

FWIW I don't use Apple Mail and haven't since I bought this machine in March 2011 so I have no idea of Apple Mail causes the same issues.  Maybe somebody else noticing the slow loading of login items who uses Apple Mail can perform a similar experiment and chime in.",,t5_2rfbh,1346702359.0,,3,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/za8ot/psa_ive_been_seeing_a_lot_of_people_upset_by_slow/

1340222791.0,vcfmc,[UPDATE] Installed SSD and HDD in MacBook Pro. Aftermath and question.,foodCourtNinja,16,1,24,"[Original post](http://redd.it/uihbq)

Hi everyone and thank you for your help updating my MacBook.
I thought I would make a little update about how it went and see if anyone can help me with a problem I have been having.

The plan was to install a 128 gb SSD in the HDD bay and replace the optical drive with a optibay with a 500 gb HDD. It was surprisingly easy to install the optibay and with a Time Machine backup Lion was up and running on the SSD within 1.5 hours. 

[Install picture](http://imgur.com/Cu8nz)

I made two partitions on the HDD:

1) NFTS - Windows 7 for games and stuff.

2) Mac Journaled - For extra storage space.

There was no problem installing Windows on the HDD and have not run into a problem yet.


I have a MacBook Pro 13"" 2010

[HDD speed test](http://imgur.com/EIEbp)

[SSD speed test](http://imgur.com/zSI7n)

To enable TRIM on the SSD I used [Trim Enabler](http://www.groths.org/?page_id=322).

So all in all everything works and I can high recommend moving to a SSD.

Now for the question… 
I have downloaded Spindown HD and can [see](http://imgur.com/LjQcA) (and hear) the HDD goes from ""Sleep"" to ""Active"" every ten minutes or so. I've set the HDD to turn off after not being used in 10 minutes
I started looking into how to get the HDD to turn off until I want to use it. I stumbled upon this [guide](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1214298).


I'm having problems making this work. I have disabled Spotlight completely

I have copy/pasted the Applescript code into Alfred extentions as seen in the guide

I have also set the two partitions to not start up automatically in terminal (with the correct UUID's ofcourse).

[As seen in Disk Utility the HDD is not unmounted.](http://imgur.com/RBXZa). 
I like to give my partition names. Meet Sascha, the hot and noisy gamer.

Have anyone done this and can come up with a more detailed guide?

And is there anything else you recommend I do to make my computer faster

My girlfriend has a 2009 white Macbook that has a hard drive that won't respond to the system (I think that's how the lady at the Genius bar said it). My options were to replace the hard drive and start over, so she too does not have the money. She's honestly the sweetest girl ever and this hard drive (which the Apple store let me keep) and she has files for when she goes back to school and more importantly a ton of pictures of her and her grandpa to which she was very close on this hard drive with no other back up available.

I know this seems dismal, especially since she's been getting the worse end of the proverbial stick.

I have owned windows computers for awhile and always had problems with them until my son talked me into a Macbook. I have had it for about 4 years and it has worked flawlessly and has had way less problems then all of the windows laptops I have had. I also have fell in love (like most apple users) with there design. Less cords

So I have been looking into buying an IMac to use as my POS system. I have been working with Apple's Business team to figure out what would be the best software for my liking. I am very stuck because I dont want to pull the trigger so fast and be unhappy

POS software for OSX is limited and I have only found a few that seem to be the best out there. [Lightspeed](http://www.lightspeedretail.com/)

My other thought was to run windows on the IMac with bootcamp and run Quickbooks again. But then again this brings windows back into the conversation and thats what I am trying to stay away from because of all the problems.

Any help would be appreciated.

I checked the router throughput graph and saw that the Apple TV was pulling no more than 2-3Mbps the entire time

While we waited, and disconnecting our Airport Express (at the suggestion of an Apple Discussions user).  We even set the AppleTV to connect to the 2.4GHz network.  Nothing changed.

I bought my computer in August of 2012, but ever since I bought my computer I have noticed that when I move my computer around, and sometimes just on it's own, it makes a weird clicking sound on the left side of the trackpad.

Now

It's a macbookpro9
I do have the warranty from Apple.
My internal hard drive is 750GB.
I dual boot my computer with Mountain Lion and Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.
I also have quite a number of partitions.

* Mountain Lion is the main partition
* There's an 8GB partition of Linux Swap.
* There's a 1MB partition for BIOSGRUB.
* There's a 25GB partition just for a shared partition because OS X doesn't recognize Ext4.
* There's a little over 100GB for Ubuntu.
* There's the EFI partition
* And there's also the OS X recovery partition.

I also use [refit](http://refit.sourceforge.net) as a bootloader.

**Story time!**

Anyways, it decides to freak out. Lines go across the screen, **in a different pattern every time**. I managed to take a video of it the last time I had my computer on me. Here's a link: [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3dutrtmjr8ho3oj/2013-03-21%2009.22.57.mov). Sorry about the vertical video, I just wanted to capture it before it stopped happening. That being said, once it stopped, I would have to force shutdown the computer, for it would become *completely* frozen.

Then, it didn't want to start up anymore. It just beeped.

So my fiancée suggested that I take it to the Apple store in Cherry Hill, got there early, and they ended up helping me early as well. I showed one of the guys at the Genius bar the video and started the computer up. It did start up, and I did mention to him about the beeping. He ran some preliminary tests and the computer **passed** all of them. He suggested that I leave it there and that he'd run more tests and give me a call before 4pm that same day (I dropped it off at about noon).

So I waited, and they said they think they figured out the problem. They said it was most likely a RAM problem and that they were just going to switch out the old RAM for some new RAM. They didn't have any in stock though (what computer store doesn't have RAM in stock?), so they had to order it and they said once it got there they'd fix it and give me a call. They guestimated that it'd be fixed on either Friday or Saturday, depending on when the part came in.

I called on Friday at about noon, but I was just hoping for it to be completed. 

So I decided to wait; there's no point in harassing the workers if they're working on it. Saturday arrives, all of the people at the Genius bar were much nicer to me than the other employees. He said that it wasn't a RAM problem. They swapped the RAM for some new RAM, and it was still acting up. He suggested that they replace the logic board, but that they didn't have it in stock (yet again). I told him that I really need to get some files off my computer first because I have class on Tuesday and there is a lot of things that I have to do, all of which are on my computer. He said that was fine.

So I came to the store and he gave me the computer, but if I booted OS X then it would just stay on the apple logo with the gray-white screen forever. He said that if I wanted to run it over to the other Apple store in Marlton, New Jersey, that they had a logic board in stock for me and they could fix it overnight. I said that sounded great and he called them back up and told them to hold it for me.

Also, but if he took just that stick out then it would semi-boot. 

So I took it to the other store and they told me that they'd call me when it was done

Sunday I called them at 2:10pm and talked to someone for a little bit. It was just a normal employee at first, but they were still having problems with it. He said he needed to run some more tests and he'd call me back in a few hours at the latest. The time went on, and when it reached 6pm I knew they weren't calling back. The store closed at 6pm yesterday because it was a Sunday.

I've read that you can't restore a Lion backup into Snow Leopard AND I can't just upgrade to Mountain Lion because my copy of Logic Pro 8 would then be unsupported. Is there a way to reinstall Lion? I never made a copy of it like some recommended and the OSs get replaced in the App Store by newer versions.

Then I installed something that required a reboot, with a gray Apple logo near the center, under which there's the icon for my local admin account and a field to fill in the password. No ""Other..."" option.
It looks like http://i.imgur.com/ivd3n.png if you want to see a screenshot.
 
So I log in to the local admin account
- My network account I just logged in as before rebooting
- The local admin account
- ""Other..."" (which lets any user in my Active Directory log in)
Once I get to that login screen
 
As far as I'm concerned, and I don't want him to have the local admin password. So finally, here's my question -- how do I get to the ""good"" login screen when first starting up the computer, without having to log in then log out? When he turns his laptop on, he needs to be able to log in to his account right away.",,False,t5_2rfbh,True

I turned it on one day and waited for it to boot up, I assumed it had gone to sleep.  I pushed the power button and it lit up and went back off.  I tried multiple times to no avail.  I have since tried turning it on randomly and gotten no better results.  It stopped working about 3 months ago.  

Has anyone else had a problem like this?  Or have any advice of how I can go about fixing the problem?  

My main problem is that ALL of my music is stored on the Mac hard drive,,False,,t5_2rfbh,False,,True

For Christmas, email, playing music, (maybe....probably) Words With Friends, and other simple stuff, I think she'd get a pretty good deal of use out of it.

I'm having trouble picking one out

* iPad 3rd gen: It has Siri
* iPad 2nd gen: It's cheap and the screen is ""large"". Very thin, not incredibly portable.
* iPad Mini: Cheap and compact. The screen is probably sufficient in terms of touchable area (maybe?). Siri. Downsides: Is it too small to use the iOS accessibility features easily?

I'm really leaning towards the Mini

Some notes:

* Cost isn't a barrier. I can afford all three
* The screen resolution is literally meaningless. Retina won't be of any material use to her.
* She'll never use the Maps app (or anything with GPS
* She won't be having 3G or any other cellular service with it.
* She has a Gmail account (my dad checks it for her now)

I'm considering an upgrade to my Acer Aspire 3758Z and my local computer shop is selling a lat 2009 Macbook Unibody for £450. I've looked at Apples for years and love the look of them but could never afford one.

I'm now thinking of replacing my home theater PC (a Dell Studio Slim Desktop) with a Mac Mini. I considered an Apple TV instead, and watching DVD ISOs - don't even have cable - so the Mac Mini seems like a better choice.

For those who are using a Mac Mini in a home theater context

* How is the noise level? I fully expect a Mac Mini to be quieter than my current machine (which isn't actually an HTPC

* How is the Mac Mini at streaming video from DVD ISOs streamed from a NAS? Do you recommend any particular software for playing DVD ISOs - e.g., it starts playing the largest VOB, rather than just showing the main menu).

* Are you generally satisfied with its performance? Would I be satisfied with running non-performance-intensive games via a Parallels Windows image / DOSBox / MAME?

* Mac Rumors suggests that a new Mac Mini is just around the corner. Should I wait (guessing the answer here is yes) or just take the plunge now?

The trackpad connected, even though the Bluetooth preferences said the radio was on, it asked me to turn it on because it was off.

Long story short, looking back). Then ran the following commands (as root) to delete the offending files:

I previously posted about repairing a slow imac with missing pictures.  I found most of the pictures in a random library folder

However, perhaps 20 times, and it continued to spit it out.  I had Family Video polish the disc, and it finally tried to copy files, then quit.  I had them polish it a second time, and it got to iWork, and now it's kicking out an error message saying ""Install failed: Some files for iWork extras may not have been written correctly""

One thing I notice is that Disc 1 and 2 are different.  Disc 1 has the typical chrome finish of a retail DVD.  Disc 2 has a blue/purple finish, the OS, gets stamped like a normal disc.  Disc 1 is quite scratched and reads fine, but Disc 2 can't read properly even after being polished perfectly.  

Has anyone else had this problem?  Or has a solution?  I called Apple and (of course) they don't support anything over a month old, I'm out of luck, and I'd probably have to pay for it anyway.

I have an Early 2011 Macbook Pro

Anyway, and what have you. So, optimizing my disk usage is key. (I have back up drives and other storage drives, as well.) This is my main, portable machine, so I take things with me to go. (obviously).

I got to to looking and realized that I had a huge ""Other Section."" I downloaded Daisydisk, and I began to weed out the old backups, that I no longer needed. Upto 6 months ago. That freed up a great amount of space. I rebooted and looked back at my disk usage with the ""About This Mac"" tool. Prognosis: Surprised. All that free space soon became ""Back Ups.""

Enter ""Pissed Mode."" I began looking at it

Back to ""About This Mac"" Seems to have done the trick. Reluctantly

Hopefully this helps someone!

I do apologies I'm not an Apple guy (yet)

Initially I wanted our students to be able to login to the iMacs using their Active Directory credentials. I know this was possible because I've read about it and it's commonly done. Unfortunately we don't have much space on our Windows servers to give our users any more then 300MB so we purchased 8TB's of internal storage for the Mac Server.

Now the consultant said I can't authenticate using AD and have a home drive mapped to the Mac Server. It has to be mapped to the AD home folder. We can't do this because the music projects are going to get very large

Now he's gone

I'm not looking forward to Tuesday when the kids come back from their Easter Holidays.

Now I've tried Google'ing the problem but its hard to get the results im looking for because it assumes I want to map the Windows home directory and I don't want that.

I'd really appreciate any help and advice on how I go about doing this. I'm about to read this PDF (http://www.afp548.com/netboot/mactips/activedir.html) to get a better understanding but I doubt it covers my situation.

**Edit** The phone was recovered!!  We contacted the school and one of the administrators did some detective work and found numerous witnesses.  We used find my iPhone and stated that we knew where the person was and to email us so we could get the phone back.  The girl who stole it was 12 so she freaked out and gave the phone to a guy who later became freaked out because we knew where he was too.  He eventually admitted to getting our messages and ditching the phone.

The admin went to the park where it was located on gps and looked for it but the kid did not find it.  He told the parents and the parents took the kids back which is when the kid admitted to it and retrieved the phone.

I'll have access to the GSX website and all the training material there.  Is this material alone easy enough and thorough enough to follow and pass the test on a first try?  If not, which are not?

**EDIT 1** I spoke to a Crucial rep today on instant chat. They informed me that there is a 3 year warranty on it

The drive price had dropped £20 since the start of the week

We'll see if it lives up the expectations! :D

**EDIT 2** OK. I had some installation woes. I ordered it with the SATA to USB cable expecting a quick disk clone. Nope! First I had to update the Firmware (from 009 to 0309!!!) but you have to download the ISO from their site

Clone. The Software must be installed on your Mac then run on the desktop. The copy on the CD crashed on loading every time with Lion. I downloaded the latest copy. This worked and started the process (note: no fucking instructions on how to do this from Crucial

I swapped the drives out. Updated the firmware (as above) then booted from the old HDD connected with the SATA to USB cable into Lion recovery mode

Soooooo... loading. Fuck a duck. I use Filevault so it comes up with the chime and logo then prompts for my credentials. HDD time to desktop was 1 min 20 seconds. SDD time from hitting enter after my password is.. about 3 seconds. Everything loaded in 5. I shit you not. No fresh build remember.. all my apps and settings intact (including who knows how much junk

SATA 2 as discussed: Black magic is showing about 285 or so on both read or write confirming my thoughts about the bus limiting the read speed. Don't care

1360635311.0,18cme8,At wits' end re: my MacBook Pro. Do I have any options? ,MPair-E,11,3,10,"Hello

I've had a MacBook Pro for about 18 months and have loved it. However, and I had to get a new one. I wasn't sure what could have gone wrong, as the MacBook sits on my desk and is rarely moved, but I didn't think much of it and got a replacement. 

A few months later, and I've run into the problem for the third time--another unresponsive charger. With this latest charger, my paranoia level was so high that I took incredible care not to ever tweak, bend or otherwise damage the device, (not that I ever mistreated the previous two) and yet it still broke. I chalked the first two up to freak occurrences, but at this point there's obviously something going on. 

Thinking this must be some kind of overheating or electrical issue, the person helping me came back and pointed out about a 1x1 cm area that evidently had water damage as indicated by the discoloration. He noted that the damage, although small, was on the logic board and that it would cost $750 to replace. I...can't really afford to eat $750 at the moment, and I'm wondering if I have any alternatives. $750 seems exorbitant considering the prices of piecemeal computer components. On top of that, as I said earlier, the MacBook is treated with great care and very rarely moved

But how on earth do you open a playlist in a new window? Some of use are mad on playlists and like to be able to drag tracks around from window to window to a particular point in another window.

1354512052.0,146pzd,New iMac questions before buying. ,AustinGnar,10,1,14,"So I'm getting a new iMac for editing video/photos and recording music.  I was wondering if there was anything about the iMac I need to upgrade or if Ill be fine to keep it the way it is.

I was planing on getting the iMac 27"" 3.2GHz quad-core intel core i5. Should I upgrade to i7? Or does it not make much of a difference?

Also is the RAM worth upgrading from 8GB or should I leave it? 
And does upgrading the graphics to the 680MX 2GB change anything.

1353955688.0,13tp77,I encountered what I consider to be a fairly large flaw with iOS,irich,12,2,10,"I was visiting family in the US recently but my wife had to stay at home (in Canada). We sent each other a lot of text messages during the trip but I was careful to try to only use iMessage whenever possible to avoid racking up massive international text message fees. As I had turned data roaming off

But I noticed that a lot of the messages I was receiving from my wife were arriving as text messages

What was happening was that my iPhone was turning WiFi off when it went to sleep. Normally this isn't a problem as it can just rely on the data network to receive any messages. But when I am roaming this either means that the message is received as a text message

As hard as I looked

It was also a problem with Face Time. If my phone was asleep and my wife tried to call

I am not posting this to bitch about Apple or iPhones or anything
