The reason we need link posts back is simple. People won't post pictures of their gear or gun because there is no karma gain (only the feels karma). People will post again if they are given the reward of even 5 link karma. Bring back what the people really want! Pictures of guns and gear and links to valuable resources for the airsoft player! 

I have been on this subreddit for nearly a year now and I have watched the quality of posts drop significantly. The only reason I come here anymore is because I have hope. I have hope that once again interesting content will be posted on this subreddit. So mods of /r/airsoft please bring back the link post before this subreddit becomes a barren wasteland of boring repetitive posts.

1365073312.0,1bnjfb,Just got fucked over by skittish liberals,NEWater,185,44,125,"Ugh

My buddy and I both run the airsoft club in this liberal arts college

It began before we even started the club or any activity in the first place. I tried to be as proactive as possible and reached out to school administration that we were here

The problems started happening when the first day of activities were about to begin. There was a game that was to begin at 9am, mind) where my buddy and I would conduct a safety check to make sure that other members had the proper equipment and also to ensure that if the cops pulled one of us over, they wouldn't flip the shit. One of the school's private security personnel saw us, confiscated all our stuff and we went through tons of shenanigans. It involved 4 weeks of depriving us of our equipment and the school administration putting the two of us on the judiciary board without giving us notice so that we ""will not show up"" for our trial and pass summary judgment. We were notified of it only after another student working for the school told us about it and we had to threaten legal action for them to back off, and they did. As we were labelling and tagging our stuff for campus security, one of the security personnel told us was that it was okay as long as our stuff stayed in our cars.

And that's what we did. We both became increasingly OCD about making sure that NOBODY had a reason to be freaked out or feel threatened by our activity, because of the shenanigans we previously experienced. They even called in the cops to try to get a search warrant for it. The cop couldn't believe that he was being called to search a car for airsoft guns, but kicked the request upstairs 3 times anyway and got denied all 3 times, so the cop said to my buddy, ""I have no reason to search the car, you're free to go.""

Despite that, they were being followed by the director of security, where she took down our mutual friend's license number, found his personal cell number and called him up demanding to know what my buddy was up to. Then we got summoned to her office where my buddy gets told that because of his refusal to allow her personnel to search his car, he got ""administratively removed"" from campus with only one hour to pack up and leave, and no, he still could not have his car.

That's the end of the shenanigans. I honestly don't know why the school has been expending so much effort on fucking with us when we have a legal activity going on and neither of us have any problems with conduct

**UPDATE**

The aggrieved party decided not to get his lawyer to sue the school because he is pretty close to graduating and because of his rare major

The outcome is this: our equipment is going to be confiscated indefinitely and the aggrieved party is going to face two judiciary board charges for a) possession of a ""weapon"" that was found in his room after campus security raided it. It is a ""knife"" that is a blunt ornament piece bought from a street market in Israel and b) refusal to obey the orders of a school official. Charge a) should be easy to slap down since the ""knife"" is no more harmful than a letter opener

They also want the aggrieved party to apologize to the director of public safety because he was apparently being mean to her and her feelings were hurt when he refused to let her personnel search his car.",,t5_2qi2x,1365133855.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1bnjfb/just_got_fucked_over_by_skittish_liberals/

No ones pushing on our team so I decide to start it and ask for covering fire and run up to the side of the building (their were no guns shooting out of the windows at the time


So the doors on the far right side of the building I'm on the middle left, I explane that is against the rule to shoot me so close with the rifle. He starts babbling on about how I can shoot people so close but he can't ect.. And how I didn't call my hits when I ran to the building (no one was even shooting when I ran)
I tell him that I'll call the hit as long as he does. 

He says somthing and turns like he's going to walk away, an I told him ""I do not accept your apology on the grounds that you could have blinded me, deafened me, taken a tooth out. You assaulted me because YOU did not follow the rules because YOU decide to be an inconsiderate asswhole who could have ruined my entire future as a functioning human and you are oh so lucky I'm not sueing you"" the owner said it was my call weather he gets banned or not at first I told him to not let him back for a while. 

Then his friends who were a table away from us, but to his friends and their were many witnesses. So now because of that he his now being reported because of the threat, and I'm now in the process of getting him assault charges. Btw this dudes 21 I'm 16. Things arnt going to be well for him for a while.

1358816132.0,170w1m,Beginner's Guide to MOLLE ,cobrareaper,132,16,32,"So recently, just making a point using facts. What vests are they talking about? [These](http://www.evike.com/product_info.php?products_id=28496). Tactical vests with already-installed pouches. I like to call them pre-made vests. I see a LOT of people wearing them at airsoft games. 


But what's wrong with these vests? Why shouldn't a noob

Its all about customization and tacticalability (shut up, or say that they use the pouches for other things. Most of these vests come with a variety of different pouches. The most common is a triple-M4 mag pouch, double-pistol mag pouch, shotgun shell pouch, holster, and a few others. If you want to buy one, ask yourself this.Do you really see yourself using a shotgun, AND M4? What if you have an AK or other gun that uses larger/different magazines? 

Despite what I just said, there is hope. MOLLE.



What is MOLLE? Pronounced ""Mol-lee"" or as in the name ""Molly"", while the vest will have the horizontal straps. [Here](http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/ctd_images/bgprod/MOLLE-434.jpg) is an average MOLLE vest, and [here](http://www.armorytechairsoft.com/7883-thickbox/tmc-molle-cqb-universal-double-mag-pouch-olive-drab.jpg) is what the back of a mag pouch looks like.

**Advantages**

The advantage of MOLLE is that, I have 3 M4 magazines (that I use), a pistol, two pistol magazines, and a knife. So, as my first MOLLE vest, I bought a simple vest, a double pistol magazine pouch, and is fairly light

**Buying your gear**

One of the hardest things is finding gear that you like. You could go with a simple vest, or a [harness with battle belt](http://www.evike.com/product_info.php?cPath=30_596&amp;products_id=30911). All depends on your preference. Do you want the highest-speed loadout possible, or do you want to be somewhat bulky but able to carry a lot? I prefer a simple vest due to the chest protection, although I will be switching to a plate carrier in a few weeks. You could probably get away with a battle belt, because you have room for a pistol mag pouch, rifle mag pouch, holster, get a chest rig/vest/plate carrier.

Where should you buy your gear from, however. As for manufacturers, Flyye and Pantac are your best options. Although pretty expensive, their tactical gear is superb and very durable. If you can't afford either of them, Condor is a good place to start. Before a bunch of angry airsoft players show up at my door, I want to say that  I've personally never had any problems with Condor other than the buckles on my vest getting busted from being shot too much. To be honest, its really just hit and miss, depending on what you get. Pretty sweet deal, ignoring what color it was. I ended up with mostly digital ACU

**Weaving your MOLLE**

You just got your gear in the mail, right? Wrong. MOLLE weaving is harder than it looks. There IS a technique, and it takes a little while to get used to, and once took my friend 3 hours to get get all of his pouches on. Even some experienced players don't know the [correct](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA6lpgApF0c) way. I didn't until 3 months ago for goodness sake. This way really helps because your pouches will not slide up and down on your vest, which in turn causes less noise and such.

**Conclusion**

Hope you found this helpful. One of the reasons I made this is so people could just link it to new players on this subreddit asking about something. If I forgot anything

EDIT: Fixed first link because it was actually a MOLLEvest with non-built-in pouches on it. Thanks Bap1811.",,t5_2qi2x,1358868950.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/170w1m/beginners_guide_to_molle/

One thing I noticed is a LOT of serious hating on backyard airsoft
       
The underlying issue here is money. Take the despised ""Walmart guns"" that some have even called to be banned. No one with money is going to go out and buy a cheap ass gun that is likely to jam, not to mention in some locations the airsoft arena/field may be over an hour away, so then even if you have the money transportation becomes an issue.          
       
The leet answer to this is if you can't afford better guns and arena fee's, rather than shitting on them wouldn't it be better to post on the safest possible way to play backyard airsoft? Yard needs to be fenced in or surrounded by some woods, avoid public areas etc?

This generally sucks and wrecks an otherwise fun days shot. Myself and some chums have been thinking about this and have come up with a couple of ways to avoid it from happening so I thought I would share our simple 5 step program:

1 - Remember that your shot may not have hit them. It's tricky to track a 6mm BB travelling at a couple hundred feet per second at 30+ feet

2 - Accept that people sometimes honestly don't notice getting hit. Folks wear a lot of kit on the field so they may not have felt the zing or heard the ping. We all do it

3 - Keep on playing fair. If your taking your hits the other team will be far more likely to take their hits. Going rogue and tanking through just fuels the fire

4 - Don't be the guy to yell ""Take your fucking hits"". Suppress the urge, 2 &amp; 3. Maybe let them know during a reset or offer a polite 'dude, got ya' but keep it friendly. If it's getting you steamed take a break for a bit, whatever it takes to avoid throwing epithets around.

5 - Let the ref know about it. You paid to play, so letting them get on with it isn't a bad thing. Most of the time the guy who got it wrong will go 'shit, my bad' and up their game. If they don't then the ref will throw them out of the game, simple as, and if that doesn't happen then look for a field with better players &amp; better refs.

The above may not work for everyone but we've used it and had a fine  time on the field as a result of it. It's not affected our win/lose ratio but it's made things a lot more fun,False,,t5_2qi2x,False,,,t3_1da8ld

I bought a TM VSR-10 pro sniper not long after they came out and set about upgrading it. Being so young (14-15)

I had a complete second cylinder kit that shot about 580 FPS with 0.2's, a TM scope mount and silencer attachment, a King Arms 200x40mm silencer, and a spare magazine. The rifle worked great but the accuracy with it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be due to the hook to the right from the VSR-10 hopup design on high FPS setups. I also didn't have any local fields where I was able to use it with the upgraded cylinder since the local field limit at the time everywhere was 400 FPS. After attending my first big event where I was able to use the upgraded cylinder on the field and having a poor time due to how the OP was run, I sold the rifle. This was back in late 2005 or 2006. I also quit airsoft at the time, since I didn't enjoy the local games or fields that were available.

Fast forward to September 2010. I got back into airsoft after I picked up a used JG 416 with 2 magazines and a battery for only $140. (it had a tightbore and it was redone internally, and the amount I knew about VSR-10's compared to before was immensely greater. I was looking for a good deal on a sniper rifle, and I finally found what I was looking for.

[Here's what I found finally in August 2012.](http://i.imgur.com/kt5xpje) It looked like crap and it was based on a JG BAR-10

I started using the rifle and although I had a good time with it, PDI.

I put together a list and saved up, and that was with going with a less expensive cylinder option. (Saved $45)

[Here is the result of all of my time and effort put into the rifle.](http://i.imgur.com/W0CTm3w)

Parts List with cost:

- Toyko Marui VSR-10 Real Shock: $204

- PDI Raven Cylinder Set: $99

- PDI HD Piston with a 90° piston end: $55

- PDI TM VSR 200 spring: $18

- PDI V-Trigger: $148

- PDI Hopup Chamber: $68

- PDI W hold AEG Bucking: $8

- PDI 6.05mm x 430mm VSR-10 Tight Bore Barrel: $80

- PDI Barrel Spacers: $18

- PDI Light Outer Barrel: $71

- PDI G-Spec Silencer Adapter: $18

- PDI Stock Screws: $10

- King Arms 200mm x 40mm Light Weight Silencer: $35

- Leapers 3-12x44 SWAT Illuminated Scope: $110

My total cost out of pocket was less because of savings from getting a few of these used. (The scope, building this rifle form start to finish and seeing it work how I want is a great feeling. The only other thing I want to do to it is cosmetic. (Laylax bolt handle) Maybe in the future I'll get a Palsonite cylinder set for a second bolt. I will be getting more springs so I can set the FPS where I want it.

As for performance, though I haven't been able to test it past 150ft yet.

[This is the album](http://imgur.com/a/75A0R)


Details are in the captions including the approximate costs of everything


The primary gun I run with was originally a JG g36c (400 fps variation purchased from Evike).  Since then

* Added a Prometheus tightbore
* Gearbox durability upgrades (AOE correction/sorbo
* New motor
* Wired to deans
* Some minor exterior modifications including sponge painted camo


I do wish I had a better way to store the battery, I have resorted to just strapping a battery bag and trying to make it a bit less conspicuous.  All in all, I am very happy with the performance of the gun.


I forgot to include my g&amp;g m14 in the pictures

I've been inside a VSR10 and clones more time then I'd like to count

I have noticed a lot of questions in thus subreddit about Sniper rifles and such

Don't start sniping when you first get into airsoft. I made that choice, but i'd never do that :D

Rule number one: This is expensive. plan to spend a lot

If you plan on regularly using a bolt action sniper rifle (BASR), the TM VSR10 or JG BAR10 (the VSRs cheaper clone) are the top two choices for spring M700s. If your looking for an L96, go with a TSD or UTG.  The TM L96 is also on the market, more expensive, but the build quality is much higher and you get correct mag placement. (Thanks Vorpalbunnie!)

As for upgrading procedure: Accuracy, get a new houp chamber. The R and ER hops are also something to consider, as are Long range barrels. After you get a nice tightbore ( I'd recommend some but I'm a diehard PDI fan so I'm biased) and bucking, start working on the ''power train'' of your gun. #1 mistake I see people do is drop in a massive spring and expect their stock cylinder parts and trigger mech parts to hold up to it. Upgrade your sears/trigger mech first, then your piston, spring guide, and finally a spring. Don't plan on this being cheap, you already have a high FPS BASR! Well

Tuning your rifle lets you get the best of what you have in it. I've found that the majority of it is trial and error. Change something

Gas rifles (Tanaka

They simply locked the market. Every airsoft gun bought outside Cybergun is illegal here... And we all know how overpriced these rebranded cheap guns are. So, the Cyma CM.028. Asia (RSOV) : $90. USA : (Evike) : $110. Poland : (Taiwangun) : €85/$105. France : €110/$136. Cybergun ... €170/$211! For a Cyma CM028 with craptastic fake markings!

Summer time is here and its all fun and games until someone is puking and passing out from heat exhaustion/dehydration. Here are some things to remember to bring with you when you go out to shoot people.

1. Drink water starting a couple **hours** before. If you're going to be out on the field for 6-8 hours you're going to want to prepare. Drink about 1-2 liters of water and make sure you're nice and hydrated the night before. You will thank yourself later.

2. Bring water/sports drinks with you. If you're drinking sports drinks

3. That little plastic water bottle you got out of the vending machine isn't going to be enough. Bring at *least* 6 of those

4. If you want

5. Sunscreen

6. Also

7. Have a first-aid kit. This is something you should have no matter what the season is

8. Eat a good breakfast. A lot of the kids I see passing out and getting sick and whatnot always give the same answer when I ask them if they ate breakfast: ""No."" Eating is important

9. Check for ticks. Damn things are like little vampires and you'll get Lyme disease if you aren't careful.  [Read up](http://www.tickencounter.org/prevention/how_to_remove_a_tick_video) on how to get the buggers removed.

Ill give a brief description if you dont want to sign in to see the post.
They are, not carbon fiber wrapped aluminum or anything like that.  The end caps are 6061 Aluminum, turned on a CNC lathe by a professional machine shop - we made several in both CCW and CW 14mm threads.  They were then anodized professionally by a company that Scatterplot and I have worked with in the past.  We have had parts done by them for our day jobs, and they do exceptional work.  They are also available in a polished or matte ""raw"" color.  (they WILL be sealed though, not just bare aluminum).

The CF tubes were sanded smooth and coated with a high strength, UV resistant, etc.  

The end caps are epoxied in with industrial strength 2-part epoxy recommended by the carbon fiber manufacturer.  

That might be more than you want to know, please message me or scatterplot!

I know that most of my 40mm launchers these days are very nice, etc, but I started launching things in airsoft using a very simple 2"" PVC pipe launcher which uses 40mm shells to propel your foam round. I used these with the Nerf Vortex Howler footballs with great effect, but frankly, those got too expensive and hard to find. I've modified my original design from a 2"" bore down to a 1.5"" bore to allow the use of much more common 40mm foam rounds, like the M385 or M29 rounds from Milsim Labs. 

Here's a photo tutorial of what you need. This is a short launcher, grips, etc on the outer body of the launcher. 

To fire it

What you need for a build like this:
20-30"" long piece of Sch 40 PVC pipe

Fernco Proflex 3001-215 Rubber coupler

40mm gas shell - this is the most expensive part


Cut your pipes to your desired length, with paint, rails, bipods, etc. However you want to run it, this thing will give you a great base to work with. To reload it, you can pull the rubber coupler off and breach load your round/refill your shell. It's modular in that you can pop the inner barrel out and use it for 2"" projectiles, etc. 

Performance-wise, and since it's so cheap, you can make a whole bunch of them. 

Enjoy! Happy launching!",,t5_2qi2x,1372129316.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1h0hg4/el_cheapo_40mm_launcher_10_modular_152_launcher/

""Fuck it

I proceed to zip from one cover to the next, SURRENDER!**"" both him and one of his teammates in 1 second. I spin around and aim up the stairs, and I spot another enemy who just looked down the stairs. He surrenders without me having to say anything. Feels good.

More of a story than an actual topic

In high school, the works.

It wasn't long until I joined a team. But the cost of having a gun equivalent to a P* in airsoft to play tournament paintball and to maintain gear was expensive. So in order to pay for everything and to avoid being one of those whiny teens who's parents buy all their gear

Eventually, dude.

I wasn't going to ask my parents for money nor was I going to back out of going to prom. So I did what any desperate teen with a whole bunch of shit would do; I sold my gear... all of it.

Being on such a tight timeline I sold 2.5k worth of gear in under 1 week for less than $600. Heartbreak.

Long story short

I had never felt depression before

After college started

It's a fun hobby

1362774822.0,19xk19,A whole different world in Eastern Europe: an introduction to the Hungarian airsoft community,Reconciliation,66,13,28,"Having played airsoft in my home country for 3.5 years and frequented /r/airsoft for approximately a year now

**Legal status of airsoft weapons**

Nothing special here

**Fields and event organization**

From what I understand after having browsed /r/airsoft for a while

That is not the case here. Those who organize games are mostly regular players with over-the-average charisma and acquaintances in the right places. What usually happens is that a player knows someone who has suitable property. This can be as simple as a forested plot of land

Another difference is the quality of the fields. No offense, rooms made out of plywood to imitate a CQB environment. The reason why that is different here is that Hungary was communist from 1949 to 1989. That means forced industrialization, agricultural collectivization, Soviet occupation and more. Factories were built and kolkhozy (I guess that is the plural of kolkhoz) were created by the hundreds. Soviet occupational forces stayed in their own barracks, separately from our own soldiers.

The system eventually failed, this country can't support the industry the communists wanted it to and kolkhozy are a pretty stupid form of agricultural organization. The Soviet Army left and soon after, conscription in the Hungarian Army was abolished. Factories, kolkhoz buildings, all Soviet and some Hungarian military bases were left standing abandoned until airsoft became a thing here. And man, I love playing at those places. They have this very distinct atmosphere, as if you were playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R

The only problem is, not getting hurt only because of a good dose of luck. The manhole cover had been stolen by metal thieves. They will steal anything that is metal from these places, even entire staircases.

**Rules**

While event organizers in the US are apparently given a free hand in making up their own rules, residing somewhere in/around the Capital, Budapest (although most country folks like me kind of hate them). If you organize a game not using these rules, expect most people not to show up and aggregator sites to refuse to spread the word about it.

The ""Book"" regulates basic things like safety, what to do if someone doesn't call a hit (shoot again), etc, and leaves game mechanics like medics and respawning up to the organizer. It also categorizes weapons and sets up category-specific limitations, e.g. the maximum mag capacity of sniper rifles is 40 and 600 for any AEG unless it has a bipod or is the replica of a machine gun.

Organizers can amend this set of rules to make it stricter

**Players**

Players come from all ages and walks of life, you ask? Because the MASZ specifies the minimum age as 16 years. I often see that you regard 12-year-olds as a nuisance, we are free of them.

But it comes at a cost. Those younger than 16 often go playing illegally, others and us. They almost never get caught though, because people here take the law very lightly. There was an incident about two years ago, where a 13-year-old boy fell off the attic of a kolkhoz building at an illegal event and died on scene. It made national news. The press asked a central figure of Hungarian airsoft, who said that it had not been an airsoft-related accident, as this was an illegal event. I think it would have been preventable if we had let them play with us.

**Weapons and equipment**

Whenever someone here posts pictures of their collection, replacing parts for better ones over the years. Of course, it is common to have an assault rifle and a sidearm, but two weapons of the same category are considered excessive. Snipers are rare because it is very expensive to build a good sniper rifle.

There are few stores in the country and we dislike them because most of them have high prices and bad business ethics. We mostly get our things from abroad and let skilled players do tech jobs, Hong Kong, etc) it is cheaper than buying the same thing at home.

That is all for now. Sorry for the wall of text and feel free to ask me anything.

Pretty happy with how it turned out.

The gun was originally a TM SR16 but everything other that the RIS and outer barrel is changed out.


You can probably see for yourself what ive done with it externally. Most noticeably is probably the new stock and grip. The body is a G&amp;P metal body. I also cut off the front sight with a dremel :P 


The internals are also completely changed out.
The gearbox is all Lonex
Barrel is a Prometheus 6.03 barrel. Hop up is a Prometheus NEO Strike chamber and uses a Prometheus purple rubber.

Bought in this condition. The Toytec M203's were basically GBB smgs in an m203 body. The way the feed/barrel was setup lent the m203 to have a STUPID amount of hop up. Something like aiming at a man's feet to nail him in the torso at 50 feet with .28's.  Pull this out for WTF's and giggles. It had a simple ""recoil"" mechanism.

1342192536.0,wi2yv,Some basic principals of a firefight that apply to airsoft.,fur_dozy,62,13,32,"I've been to several games and there's something I always notice. People  fail to grasp some pretty basic tactics that mean alot when the mag hits the receiver. I figured I'd list some basic things that will help any team

-When the game starts, then take cover somewhere that allows you to cover slower players as they come up on line. The idea is not just to get far up, but get to a spot that you can prevent the other team from doing the same.

-There are several different firing Techniques that should be used to help advance your team forward. Firing semi auto, you'll need to try something else. Suppressing fire is a huge part of a successful team. Suppressing fire is often overlooked as it can use a ton of ammo and, by definition does not produce hits. It simply keeps the enemy behind cover while a teammate positions himself better. This is key in gaining ground. suppressing fire doesn't need to be full auto, as long as the enemy knows you're firing at him, it will work. You can also use firing techniques to keep players from going places you don't want them. even if you cant get a clean shot on them. When you fire on a certain area, say the left side of a cover, any players behind it will naturally stay to the other side. If there's a cover a player is behind, shoot at that side to guide the enemy to the easier side

-Before the game starts

I'm gonna stop there. I congratulate you if you made it all through.

So my friend is covering me as I sprint to a vantage point.

I have no ammo and our previous place was unstable to stay in.

So I place in my mag and hear battle cries; Instincts activate and I fuckin bolt.

I turn around to see the enemies

I snap my stock back and empty my 30round mag on them

The kids proceed to kill my friend and chase me.

Im dizzy and confused but I sprint a little

I pull out my pistol. Shit I forgot to fill the mag with bb's.

Now there are about 3 kids charging at me. I put away my weapons and deploy my guns bipod so it can stand and not get dirty.

I proceed to draw my foam axe.

*First swing* I whacked this kid in ths side of the head. He calls hit.

Now the the other one is drawing near and with his Jabba the hut buddy tailing about 20 meters away.

I go to attack

The next kid was nearly there. He looked so similar to Gabe Newell

On my head is their CADPAT boonie - I also have a skullcap (actually on underneath the hat... strange habit but it keeps my head camouflaged if my hat gets snagged by a tree branch and winds up on my back). I do have a ""Jesse James Mask"" as CPgear calls it

Finally, and a medical pouch (basically the generic utility pouch with some internal retention abilities and it zips to fold open instead of just from the top). On my back is a 3L hydration carrier for my P* air tank, and a CADPAT hydration tube cover to cover most of my air hose.

Then there's the P* gun... I built that up from scratch (which is the most expensive way to do it), and black parts on it so that I didn't have a 100% black gun that stuck out against my CADPAT gear. It used to be shorter (9"" REC7 barrel and 7"" DD Lite rail) but I decided to get a little crazy this weekend and throw the longest barrel I could find in it - a ~509mm (I think) inner barrel in a 20"" outer barrel: it stuck out past the outer barrel a bit so I grabbed the ridiculously long suppressor off of my old APS2 and threw it on there (the brass threads for the APS2 are on the business end - that's the silly brass color you can see at the end of the suppressor).

They started yelling at me to learn the rules etc. I didn't argue and stopped playing cause I figured if all these people were yelling at me then I was probably wrong.

**Background**:North Korea is about to launch a missile towards the united states. But first they have to take nuclear materials (box with bottles of Gatorade) from a refinery to a missile silo. Once they reach the missile silo they have to transfer the materials to a missile (move it form one box to another 10ft away) and defend it until they finish calculations to launch (a series of easy math questions).

**Mission objective**: The Americans have to intercept the materials or identify the materials by taking a picture of them and sending it to HQ (send a text with the picture of the Gatorades to game control). once the message has been sent the North Koreans have 10 minutes to finish the calculations

**How North Koreans win**: They have to transfer the radioactive materials and finish the calculations

**Special players**:

* Scientists: both sides have scientists that are the only people allowed to carry the radioactive materials. Scientists are heavily armored

* Medics: both sides also have medics. The number of medics is dependent on the number of players Medics take 20 
seconds to heal a person **note people can spawn without medics by walking outside the battle and waiting for a 
minute. So the game is not over when the medics die.**

The purpose is to get a good group of people together who can translate their knowledge into the database so new airsofters and other people who aren't as experienced can get efficient access to this knowledge. I think it'd help the sport out a lot if it gets big and comprehensive enough.

There is a bit of incentive to do the work of putting in the compatibility info

Searching. Isn't. Hard. Seriously, find the part in an online store to find the name of it, its all there for you. The internet is filled with countless guides regarding airsoft.

Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.""*



The same questions just clutter up the page and bring down the cool threads like the occasional ""memorable stories"" or people making threads showing off their inexpensive ghillies.

You damned squeakies got some reading to do.

* Thou shalt not ask others if they want to sell their things.

This is rude beyond compare, do not ask.

* Thou shalt not try to hock YOUR stuff

This is mostly aimed at wandering hockers. Unless you expect some serious lowballs, how often you cleaned it, or if you were a retard and got silicone oil in your hop-up.  We can't even be sure you didn't just grab it off the table over yonder and are trying to fence stolen goods.  We don't want it.  This goes double for places that have a shop attached.  That's kind of rude to the people running the store.

* Thou shalt not judge other people's equipment

Not everyone has mommy and daddy's platinum card to max out at Evike.com.  Most of us work for a living.  Most of us don't see the point in spending a few grand on a full costume when a uniform

* Thou shalt not bum gear off strangers.

I don't care if you give me collateral, cracked receivers, lunched gears, etc.  Sometimes they don't come back at all.  So, no.   You should have brought your own gun.

* Thou shalt bring your own ammo.

Unless we're talking a several hour long Operation, both costing me money.  See previous commandment above for other reasons why you shouldn't bum stuff.  And I swear to god if I see another kid wandering the field asking if anybody has BBs, I will shoot them myself, regardless of team.  If you're out of ammo, you're out of the game.  Period. Head back to the safe area and resupply.

* If thou hast borrowed something

Don't assume because the person who lent it to you isn't hounding you that you get to keep something.  They might have either forgotten

* Thou Shalt not touch!

If it ain't yours, don't retrieve it.  Leave things where they lay.  You may oogle someone's gun at their table, but unless you are offered permission to touch it, or you ask for such, do not touch it.

* Thou. shalt. not. steal.

My shit is labelled in several locations including internal locations you wouldn't even begin to know about.  If you steal my shit, make it very conspicuous.  Stop the thief from leaving by all legal means.  There is a degree of honor and faith in each other intrinsic to Airsoft, both on and off the field.

Each upper is distinct, and slide on any other upper I want. They are configured as a 14.5"" with a M203 (barrel mounted), 14.5"" with a free float 7"" DD Lite rail, and a 8"" with a DD Lite Rail and integral suppressor. Been thinking of changing the 14.5"" barrel on the second upper for a 12"" barrel, but we'll see.

[Here's a video of an upper swap, did internal work, and put together the M203 launcher and before I went LiPo on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Ke8yfLBrc#t=08m29s)

Total cost for the externals (the rifle pictures with all 3 uppers) is $624. This doesn't count accessories, M203 charger, EOTech (replica), etc etc. If you add all of that on there, it makes it a LOT more expensive, but I view all of those as general items. The only ones that get used only with this platform are the M203 shells, which I only spent about $160 on, is an amazing deal. ($350+ new for just those)

I see quite a few people who call themselves snipers on the field wearing ghillie suits. Truth is, to break up your outline.

*First off

They were invented by Scottish gamekeepers to resemble heavy foliage and to be used as a portable hunting blinds. The first military unit to use them were the British Army's Lovat scouts in 1916.

Ghillies are a type of artificial cryptic camouflage

Some do this better than others. Any ghillie that you buy [premade](http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Red-Rock-Outdoors-Mens-5-Piece-Ghillie-Suit&amp;i=451990&amp;r=view&amp;aID=503I1&amp;cvsfa=2586&amp;cvsfe=2&amp;cvsfhu=343531393930&amp;s_kwcid=goobasecontent_goobasecontent_filler&amp;cID=GSHOP_451990) will take serious work to even be usable. I'll break it down: first, the best choices ae for you to make one yourself, or to buy one second hand off someone who knew what they were doing.

Making one yourself will give you the maximum amount of customization, so I'm not going to get into that, but I will tell you mine is made from scratch, based off a full set of Woodland Tiger stripe, and is a crawler type. I sewed all of my netting on the blouse and boonie, cut, dyed and destrung all of my burlap

You have several choices to make when considering building one: What is my AO? What color's should I use? Where should I put jute? How will I attach netting? 

For Woodland AO's: Greens and browns, with a little light green is probably your best bet. 

For the style of ghillie, considering making a home-made [viper hood](http://www.tacticalconcealment.com/pd-viper-hood.cfm) if you don't wan't to blow your budget. If you don't fit either of those, maybe a full body ghillie with jute on everything would be best, then again, it will weigh a ton and be very hot. For the hood vs. Boonie debate, I use a Boonie, that's just what I had

Another thing you could use is a [Ghillie TOG/Webtex Concealment Vest](http://www.amazon.com/Sniper-Ghillie-Foundation-Hydration-Compatible/dp/B00655C426) which takes out a whole aspect of construction. I have never used these but a fellow sniper

As for attaching netting

If your going to dye your own burlap and destring it, and I find it the best because you don't have to darken/lighten any of the colors to get what you want, you can just buy them.

As a rule of thumb

One more thing. be aware of ''black holes'' caused by your muzzle and more often your scope. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/oIQhy.jpg) is an otherwise badass photo of me

[My Primary](http://i.imgur.com/UxmEhqch.jpg): Real Sword Type 56-1. Please excuse the rotation.

This gun is my *pride and joy*. You can't really say much to justify the greatness of a company which designed its own gearbox to break free from the original Marui design (which wasn't real steel spec) just so that they could use de-milled Norinco type 56's as externals.
 
Internal upgrades include:
 
* A Prometheus purple bucking (which really wasn't necessary) 

* [A real steel railed sight](http://i.imgur.com/pASw51q.jpg)

Of course though, when it is so hot outside that using the T56 would give me third degree burns. Steel gets hot, even on a gun as cool as the Real Sword.

Reddit's content is driven by the people and judged by the people. This subreddit's content is so unoriginal and boring because it is so tightly monitored by the mods. Shouldn't we be able to choose what is good and what is bad? It is our choice what gets upvoted and what gets downvoted. Mods are here just to monitor what is going on

Some say we should create a new subreddit for loadouts,500 subs only a couple hundred are actually active, most are people who no longer care to see the repetitive posts here. 

This subreddit will die and everyone will leave if this is not fixed. I for one do not want to see this happen. Could the mods please listen to what the people have to say? This is our subreddit and we drive everything that happens on it. Why can't we choose what happens here? 

Thanks for listening what I have had to say everybody. 

EDIT: The point I am trying to get across is that the mods will not give what the community really wants. The community drives the subreddit and the mods dont trust the community. After the whole DMR incident mods cracked down but what they did was not helpful. People could still post their ""DMR"" through a text post but they didn't. The mods have decided to punish us for the actions of few. They have been choking the whole subreddit of content for over 6 months now! I just say its been long enough and its time to get it back.

Compiled from varies previous posts
The exact web address is not listed


1) EVIKE.com - just kidding just kidding 

But really-


1) Clandestine Airsoft - great for internal parts, etc. 

2) Airsoft Store Canada - I live in the US and have personally ordered from here. Pretty much a Canadian version of Clandestine. Many internal parts and they stock only the best! Very competitive prices and reasonably priced + quick shipping.
(exact web address: airsoftstore.ca)

3) Ehobby Asia - from the reviews

4) Tiger Tactical Airsoft - being a US retailer AND having their website set up like it is makes this a great choice. Many options for selecting the right gear/guns/parts you need. Here is an example. I wanted an M4 magazine. So I went to magazines &gt; AEG/Electric &gt; M4/M16

5) Your local Airsoft shop/store - yes, the best place without paying outrages overnight shipping, is your local store. Supporting them is also important, and surprisingly, the tac gear at my shop is about the same as online. 

Sorry I couldn't research these more

1) When you are finished shooting your gun (AEG's) and not going to use it for at least 24 hours

2) always carry an extra mag (or two) than you need

3) Take time to pick a tactical vest. You cannot just ""go get a vest"". Figure out what is going to suit your needs and then go from there. Find the right style: are you LMG gunner or a person who rushes ahead? Do you need a few mags for short games or many for lengthy games.

4) Choose your BB's Wisely. Walmart or Academy Crossman BBs arent going to cut it. Invest in a good brand like King Arms, many a gun has been destroyed by bad BBs.
Always buy.2 or better BBs. I personally use .23 or .27 for better range.

5)Lube up those gas guns. My KWA MKII was ruined by me not properly Lubricating my gun. Silicone oil works well

We're trying to ramp up the training a bit in our MOUT shoothouse for our tactical lanes where students are tested on the skills they received in a simulated real-world environment, but we're aiming for a dozen at $150 or so per gun.  It has to be an M4/M16 variant.  We're not worried too much about mag changes to cut down on parts that can get lost.. The intent is to just have something we can use indoors, so that also means we don't need anything that shoots super far (and since paintball and sim-rounds are a no-go indoors).

1) I'm leaning towards G&amp;G or ICS.  Just need a base model that's reliable and will stand up to abuse.  Thoughts?  Any other brands?

2) How long do these batteries last before a recharge is needed?  I'm thinking we'll need a few backup batteries and chargers.

3)  Will a local store carry this much stock where I could walk in and make a purchase

4)  Anywhere I may be able to bring the price down per gun with a bulk order like this?

Thanks guys.",,t5_2qi2x,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1g2ymh/info_for_a_military_member_and_airsoft_noobie/

There's alot of banter about whether or not it is legal/illegal to remove them.

Here is the federal law

&gt; No person shall manufacture, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm (""device"") covered by this part as set forth in [§1150.1](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html#15:3.1.3.7.1.0.33.1) of this part unless such device contains, or has affixed to it, one of the markings set forth in [§1150.3](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html#15:3.1.3.7.1.0.33.3) of this part

[Source](http://law.justia.com/cfr/title15/15-3.1.3.7.1.html)

On a federal level, and transport.

Now, you may be required to keep the orange tip on when not in your place of residence or a designated airsoft facility/field. A quick google search can let you know what your local laws are.

This information is based on US law

So, you'd better have held on to that orange tip, or find a replacement.

I hope this can help answer some questions, I'll be glad to hear it!

[Airsoft Park](www.airsoftpark.com) - One of my favorite places to order from. This store has a large selection of popular gear and it's typically in stock. Prices are a bit high but the incredible staff and free shipping make up for it. 3 orders with them and they have all been very pleasant.

[WarIdiot](http://www.waridiot.com/) - I've placed one order with these guys. Free shipping and fair prices. Large selection on parts for GBBs and AEGs. Had a good experience and found out they are also known as [AsiaAirsoft](http://www.asiaairsoft.com/) which also offers free shipping and a large selection of different items. Like the WarIdiot order

[GreenBase Trading Co](http://greenbase.hk/) - This has to be my favorite site to browse. Enormous collection of items at incredible prices. Prices are lowered when you register as a member and discounted prices for larger orders. No free shipping and it's a punch in the dick when you see the bill. Spent $500+ on gear and parts and paid ~$100 in shipping. Before I placed the order, order with a friend or two and take advantage of their pricing system.

[Airsoft-Club](http://airsoft-club.com/shop/) - Never used them though they seem like a legit shop. I've browsed their inventory a dozen times and it get's updated and new things are added.

[eHobbyAsia](http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/) - Very well known oversea retailer and has been around for years. Never ordered from them but have talked to staff and they were nice people. No free shipping.

[EBairSoft](http://www.ebairsoft.com/) - Never ordered from these guys but I hear it's a hit or miss. I've read some successful stories as well as some sketchy

[Tiger111HK](http://tiger111hk.com/) - Huge selection and decent prices. No free shipping here. The order I placed had a few items that were out of stock. Staff had no problem refunding me for OOS items and shipped everything quickly. 

[GunnerAirsoft](http://www.gunnerairsoft.com/) - Never ordered from them and don't know a thing about them. Just found the website.

[ACM Gear](http://www.acmgear.com/) - Chinese made gear. Stock some replicas as well. Never placed any orders but I've browsed them a few times.

[Gun Mall Japan](http://www.gmj-web.com/) - Never ordered from them but reviews tell me they're reliable. Inventory looks impressive. No free shipping.

[J.K.Army](http://www.jkarmy.com/eng/magento/) - Just heard about these guys

[Ego Airsoft](http://www.egoairsoft.com/) - Free shipping replica shop. Never ordered from them.

[365AirsoftShop](http://www.365airsoftshop.com/) - Free shipping and lots of replicas. Haven't ordered from here until today so I'll see how it goes over the next couple weeks.

1356095542.0,1584ci,My Customized Gear and Air Rig for Polar Stars,silentobservant,51,7,43,"[Album here](http://imgur.com/a/Sbrk3). (I turned into a pillow for this photoshoot.)


A natural tradeoff for a Fusion Engine user is finding a place where to put the tank. Its pretty standard to see tanks HPA in backpacks


My goal was something lightweight, looks tacticool, and unlike my other rigs of the past --  let me shoulder a gun comfortably.


I went against light Plate Carriers like the JPC and the Banshee because I wanted a full range of motion and not be limited as to how I shoulder my gun. Chest rigs like the LBT 1961a's were considered


This rig was my first big step into the world of quality gear. Coming from Condor gear, this is where it stands.


Most of the gear is real, the repro stuff is of a MUCH higher quality than your standard ACM gear. I drew the line at a $50 MC Eagle Double Dual M4/M16 mag pouch. I would need two, and an MBITR pouch of the same price. Not going to happen. I am happy to say that the only Condor on my gear is a blood type patch.


I don't need a pistol. It's nice to have, so I would rather take the extra space a pistol would take and focus it on my primary so that I wouldn't need a pistol in the first place.


I also do not need a dump pouch. Clever reloading techniques nullify the need for one.


I'm not trigger happy


The pouches also allow to place 2 MP5 mags in each slot, I may get HSGI TACOs in the future. I'll figure something out.


Nearly everything in this loadout was customized to my liking


------


The Ingredients:


* OSOE Micro Chest Rig - 8 Columns


* 2 Flyye Dual Double M4/M16 Mag Pouches


* HSGI Leg Rig with 2 M4 Fastmags (Not Pictured)


* Another HSGI Leg Rig


* Flyye MBITR Pouch


* ICOM F4S


* U94 Nexus PTT


* Tons of spare nylon straps and Velcro


Modifications:


* Hidden strap clips on the front of the chest rig


* Custom mount for the VIP Strobe


* Custom PTT and hydration tube mount


* Folding the lids of the mag pouches inwards so as to provide a secure place to hold a magazine without it falling out.


* Custom mount for a Velcro name tape


* Laid Velcro down to keep the main pouch in the rig easily accessible, keeping the pouch permanently open. The rig lays so flat that this is not an issue.


* Modified HSGI Leg Rig (detailed below)


* The Air Rig assembly (detailed below)


[The Air Rig](http://i.imgur.com/jGcUCh.jpg):


This came about though some dumb luck and my persistence to not get rid of my 47ci 3000psi steel tank. I love my fusion engines, but I scrapped the idea due to it being too much of a hassle for the insane price tag I would have been.


Just looking through gear on eHobby, so I'm not even mad. Leave it like this, eHobby.) Anyway, this pouch caught my eye, so I took a look at its dimensions, very helpfully provided by eHobby. The pouch matched up my tank almost exactly.


I decided I would mount my tank horizontally, and a trip to the hardware store later, I had the elbows I needed to pull this off. I ended up with [this](http://i.imgur.com/UbCixh.jpg).


One issue I predicted was the tank rotating in place, but is it ever coming out again? Who knows, haha. Doesn't matter right now.


Finding a place to put my tank was nice and all, and I didn't like the options LBT or Tactical Tailor had for hydration. I thought, ""lets fold this hydration bladder in half, and use a square-ish pouch to mount inside."" Luckily enough, I found the most perfect pouch for this job: the ""Spec-Ops Square Utility Pouch"", by Pantac.


This new combination of hardware was mounted via MALICE clips to another HSGI leg rig. This leg rig was modded so that it could instead serve as MOLLE real-estate on my back. It is also easily detachable so you can refill your tank or hydration.


This combination of air rig and hydration solves multiple problems


Ingredients:


* Guerrilla Air 47ci 3000psi Tank


* Flyye Water Bottle Pouch


* Amped Airsoft Regulator


* 1/4"" Elbows from Hardware Store


* Ninja Paintball Coil Hose w/ Slide Check


* Full Clip Paintball Air Line Cover


* Two short MALICE clips


Luxury


This is the stuff I wouldn't buy at full price


* Name tape


* Milspec Monkey Mini US Flag


* Condor Blood Type Patch


* Custom Callsign Patch (Mostly experimental


* 2 Chemlights


* Dummy VIP Strobe


* Dummy Smoke Grenade (Not Pictured)

------

When I was looking for a new loadout, I came up with this. I'm posting mine as a result from all those findings to inspire others who are also looking to build a new loadout or air rig. Maybe it can work for someone else too.



All of this comes together to make the most comfortable and effective rig I've ever built.



TL;DR: **Item's names do not limit their functions.** Do not be afraid to modify your gear.

I'm currently building a web app to more easily buy a load out of a gun and maybe other gear as well. I am going for something like Pimp My Gun that is a visual designer and is able to pull prices (for example lowest prices on AirsoftGI

I need suggestions though as to what features I should include that I haven't thought of. Is the extreme graphic customizability of Pimp My Gun something you guys value? Or are regular product images ""arranged"" as if they were put on a gun OK?

What other pertinent info do you guys think should be on there that you guys consider when buying a AEG or airsoft gear? Should I build a FPS and gun stats database? Currently in the works is a general compatibility database (i.e. this mag works for this model/manufacturer  gun).

Also, amazon account or Airsoft GI account info and have your load out automatically ordered and put in your cart for easy check out on the respective vendor sites.

PM me or post your comments here for suggestions on how I can make a helpful tool for the airsoft community.

Thanks

Im a Norcal airsofter here and mine and a ton of others only outdoor field has closed! Somebody complained about the drinking and selling of alcohol. We think that somebody was being a jerk and got banned or kicked out so the complained to the city of San Jose. I can assure everybody after going there so many times that every time i have been there i NEVER saw anything even related to alcohol and never saw anybody selling it. I love this field cause its the only outdoor field in the area and im really sad that its closed. Tell your friends! We need 1

So... I have be popping in and out

DMRs.

Look a DMR and a Sniper Rifle are two rifles that have been upgraded to the point that they shoot very far in comparison to their stock counterparts.

DMRs/Sniper Rifles are not:

* Non-upgraded rifles of any kind  (that's a RIFLE)

* A rifle that shoots very hard without range (that's not *needed* in DMRs!)

* Something that everyone should have.

Every post with DMR in the title is someone who has a long rifle that shoots okay

I love DMRs, I've owned 4 of those. When I see DMR and Sniper Rifles in the title, I would LOVE to see someones beautiful creation that I can congratulate the person on. NOT some rifle that needs upgrade

&gt;Sidenote.

* Any rifle can be a DMR.. that does not mean every rifle SHOULD be a DMR.

For example

Pushing 400 fps with at least 285 feet of range (ER-Hop baby!) and you cannot hear it within 10 feet of it thanks to internal foam.

* Some rifles have better range and internals than others

A&amp;K SR25s are cute

* To make a DMR or Sniper Rifle, some DIY mods, and money for parts. That is how you make beasts that are well known on the field. However, you CAN make a DMR class weapon for an M4 or a L96 for all of 200$.

M4s are easily the most versatile weapon on the market with the most aftermarket abilities. Swapping a few correct parts and a new hopup and you can have a monster. My best DMR was a JG M16 that only had the motor, piston, wiring, and ER-Hop. A good tech also helps (Star_Folder) who put all of this together using extra parts lying around the house. To this day he still says that is one of the straightest shooting guns he has built.

It didnt turn out that bad surprisinglly. *still a work in progress*

Base Model was a boneyaeded JG TCW, 394 FPS. The Springer pictured is for looks, I use a Stubby grip as a handstop. 

Over an M4, and at the same time can be used without a mask and still have a great sight radius. Externally it's FAR from finished, but Going for a more Tactical job then this and leaning more to a Bravo CPW-esque build more then just because i like setting forums on fire...

If you know how to CAD feel free to send me a part file and a kind request with a few bucks for shipping and I'll make you any part. Small parts could be made for $1-2 and larger parts more expensive.

Before the game started

We started the day's games, and also the ability to escape from almost every situation and just disappear to start dropping targets on another part of the fields. The guy with the G22 did the same, and even better than I did. After the games I learned that he had been asked by his team to hunt me down each game and kill me. My team didn't ask me to do that, but I took it on as a personal goal.

The day wore on, then slunk off to try again later.

10 minutes into the last game, pulled my TM Sig226, and looked around. About 15 or so meters away, I saw the guy with the G22. He had me dead to rights, but merely nodded and disappeared. I grabbed the watch and realized that he was a [better shot than I thought](http://i.imgur.com/pTc3h.jpg).

The game went on for another half hour I think. During our final push, asked why he didn't shoot me when he shot my watch. He replied: ""Because it was more challenging to hit that, and I would have called it a cheap kill. I like to know people can at least shoot back if they see me first."" With that, he walked off and I haven't seen him since.

I'm from the UK so licencing and trades will be different to their US counterparts. They are in the order that I purchased them

[KWA SR16](http://imgur.com/CXfPPwC) - First gun after getting back into the hobby. Has a PTS AFG2 on the front, DMR weapon. The UK version of this is distributed by ASG and has full LMT trades. Purchased with 5 Lonex flash mags

[KWA USP .45 Match](http://imgur.com/t41ZZ7Y) - Next up I needed a sidearm as if you take a gun hit at our site

[KWA Glock 19](http://imgur.com/kFJbVpP) - I used to own a KJW Glock 19 before selling all my kit to go to Uni

After buying the M16 and mags etc

[KWA LMT Defender Patrol Carbine](http://imgur.com/QKF2IfU) - Not entirely sure what the actually KWA name for this is but they are sold under that name in the UK. It's a CQB length M4. Wanting something more tacticool, MOE Stock, AFG on the MOE rails. Added a Madbul tight bore that was longer than the gun so it runs completely through the silencer. G&amp;P T1 sits on top, really like this style of sight

At this point I also wanted to switch out to midcaps instead of running just highs. Picked up 6 120 P-Mags and added ranger plates for more tacticool points. After this

[G&amp;P Stoner 63](http://imgur.com/TllaMyc) - I've always wanted a LMG but could never man up about carrying the weight all day. Then I spotted G&amp;P's Stoner 63, a 9.6v 4600mah


[G&amp;P Viper Long](http://imgur.com/hHvSt8w) - My latest gun, upper and lower reciever and stock. Clubfoot pistol grip, G&amp;P rail covers and Aimpoint finish it off. Running this with my PMAGs and it shoots 348-350 every shot, 350 being our site limit.

I'm going to play airsoft tomorrow for the first time since the end of October. This is the longest break I've had from airsoft in the past 28 months,000ft² indoor airsoft field composed mostly of hard cover and a few small bits of soft cover. I will have hydration at spawn, which I should be visiting every 1-10 minutes.

This will also be the first game where I will be taking out my new toy, and can run at 800psi, which makes for insane range (100ft on a flat flight with 0.28's), actual felt recoil (from a 8lb rifle), and quite an intimidating sound. (The four Co2 grenades will range across more than half of the field) The fifth grenade is an old school Mosquito Molds 8mm shell, holds 54 BB's and they FLY like no other out the barrel. Has serious range and a good bounce to the BB;s for ricochets.

Pistol: WE Glock 17

Sight: Swiss Arms Aimpoint

Foregrip: Magpul Vertical Forgrip


Got this last week

I bought it because I mainly play CQB and wanted to spice things up a little bit and it turns out it's a quality piece of kit, you can hear it from one side of our site to the other and strikes fear into people. Easy to install as well, takes about two minutes to add / remove the Glock, needing the removal of just two pins!

First thing I want to say is how well it affects your personal accuracy. I ran the Glock as my main and had really good results with it thinking I was a good shot

I've made some changes to the kit itself, shape which felt weird to hold. Although the stock grip was defiantly sturdy (if not a bit hard to pull down) it just didn't feel right for me. I'm also looking into buying an extended barrel for the Glock itself to boost the FPS of the pistol (Currently 240 in English weather, but was up to 320 in the 32c we've been having these last two weeks), only thing to watch is when the barrel cocks up is if it catches in the outer barrel of the kit.

One of the problems for me with this piece of kit is that I run with an s-10 gas mask to protect my beautiful face, and put the hop fully on. Minor problem to be fair, if you aim for the head, you're going to at least hit the chest.

Another problem for the gun is because of the way it’s a screw-less release system, other than slight wobble if you pull the grip to the right. I'm looking at modding it but drilling a hole right through and placing a bolt in.

As I say, but indoors this thing is a beast!

1354382513.0,143xmc,Very detailed comparison between HPA guns and AEG's. Daytona's and P*'s,xPrimer13,44,9,19,"Hey, are they a definite pro or con over a standard battery and gearbox? And lastly
Just things I've always wanted to ask a user...""                      
**The response i got was one of the best comparisons I've ever seen. Anyone who has ever wondered, as it was posted on such a small form.** So without further to do here it is.  
                             
First and foremost I will tell you that I personally prefer the HPA system over traditional AEG's, I just sold my last AEG so I could fund my DaytonaGun FAL.       
        
People who are against P* and DaytonaGun will give you three chief complaints; money
          
1. Money       
Yes. These systems will be more expensive than your traditional AEG. People will look at the cost of the weapons system coupled with the need for a tank and a regulator and are intimidated. I bought my set ups in pieces. First the gun, these systems are field ready out of the box. No need to check compression, no need to buy new gears or a mosfet or a new motor or worry if my battery is powerful enough to run the motor. Looking at overall cost, an AEG may have a lower start up cost, but in the long run I still feel that these systems are worth it. The only maintenance required is to hit it with some silicone lubricaton every once in a while.      
      
2. External Air Rig      
Some players feel that the need for an external air source is the limiting factor in deciding against these systems. Some players think that it's unrealstic for an air line to be coming out of the gun. It comes down to preference. I run my airline through my load bearing gear so that it is difficult to see. And I put my tank in a back pack. The air line is relatively difficult to spot and I am not limited to shooting only right or left handed. With enough line
[pictures](http://imgur.com/a/fZF9G)      
      
I will also mention that filling an air tank is alot easier than charging a battery. If someone's battery dies at a game, with the increase in popularity of the P* fusion engine, retailers that sponsor these guns often bring an air compressor so that these users can fill their tanks. Great examples are Operations Northern Light, Irene and Faded Giant. While the facilities for these events did not have fill stations on hand, the sponsors (Amped Airsoft, Polar Star) brought an air compressor with them so that HPA users could fill their air all weekend long.      
      
2a. HPA vs GIM (Gas in mag)
Some players will argue that you get more realism out of a Gas in Mag weapon. Yes that's probably true; the mags hold less rounds and the gun does kick to a degree. But I have yet to find a gas in mag system that does not suffer from that same short comings that all GIM guns suffer from. Variable performance based on temperature is my biggest complaint as they don't function well in cold weather. The external air rig negates this as the air flowing into the system is the same everytime. My velocity won't drop because it is cold out. And it won't go up because it is warm out. I can adjust my velocity where I want it to be via my external rig and then lock it using an approved tournament lock. In addition
      
3. Changing velocity
Some players have complained that it's just too easy to change the velocity on these systems. It is a fact that it is relatively easy to change the velocity, at Irene this past year, They would put a sticker on your weapon that said what pressure you were running and what the gun chronoed at. I showed them my tournament lock and they told me it was not needed. as staff would be spot checking guns in the field. To me, this is not a good way to police the HPA users out there. I personally was not spot checked all weekend, nor did I see anyone being spot checked. This is why MAG requires a tournament lock for HPA users at all of its games. In addition, many AEGs these days have quick spring change features. Who is to stop a player from heading to the safe zone and quickly swapping a spring for more velocity? In the same vein, spot checks must be done to keep everyone safe.       
      
4. Maintenance. 
You asked about maintenance for these systems. I touched on this a little bit before. These guns are relativity maintenance free. The DaytonaGuns require a silicon lubrication once over every once in a while. For the P* system, you will find that they stopped being manufactured in the 1990's. Most of them are still running today (if you can find them ) and they haven't been made in 20 years. In addition, the sole distributor for DG in the US is based right here in Illinois. Should an issue ever arise, you can always contact him.       
      
5. P* vs DG
This really comes down to preference. I have both systems and have run with both extensively. The P* offers more end use customization due to the addition of a computerized Fire Control Unit FCU. You can adjust settings like ROF, etc. DG offers an unparalleled kick back. Many have said that it recoils more than a 22 rifle. There is also much satisfaction to be had when firing due to the crisp sound and movement of the bolt. Even racking the gun is quite satisfying. Couple this with the fact that there aren't that many DG users out there when compared to P* and you have a case to get one.       
      
Overall it comes down to personal preference. Can you build an AEG that will have similar performance to a DG or P*? Yes. Do DG and P* cost more? Yes. Is it worth it to me to run these systems? Yes. Are these systems for everyone? No.       
      
I hope I answered all of your questions :) (yes he did)

I take a good look around and there is only one or two other guys in the base. I stood up without saying a word and walk ten paces.

1371362233.0,1gfwyj,I still have active wholesale accounts and can get guns for cheaper to you guys.,JarekBloodDragon,53,19,123,"As many of you know I used to run a business. Well Machinima offered me a job years ago so I took that job and closed my shop down then. Business isn't exactly a fun job and I was a bit naive in thinking I'd be doing all hobby and no business. How ever, if you were to order through me and give me the okay to make some videos on it that would solve that issue. I don't skirmish with these. I basically take them out of the box and do in depth quality checks for my videos. Essentially more quality control. Once the videos are done I clean the products up and they go back in the box and shipped to the rightful owner. I've done this a few times for subscribers in the past with their generosity.

TL;DR version. I can get guns for $20-50 or so cheaper than retail price for you guys. Price reduction varies on product obviously. I can make videos of said product and keep my channel alive as well as checking to make sure the gun works as promised. I receive no profit from the gun purchased through me (usually I lose money on shipping doing this) and only receive money from machinima for the videos. Both parties win.

[Click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTrhh6a0d00) if you want an example of what exactly I do in reviews. If you haven't seen my videos in a long time I'd recommend looking at it as I've really put a lot of effort into improving and my videos are quite different now. 

Thank you for your consideration. I'm looking at ways to improve the community. I think being able to get things for cheaper is a good start.

EDIT: Wholesaler names include spartan imports, and ukarms. If it's on Evike I can get it for cheaper. Very few exceptions. Keep in mind I work at night. I won't be replying around the times of 5am-4pm. 

DOUBLE EDIT: If you want a price check please provide a link to the gun you are referring to. Preferably on Evike. It just makes this easier. 

TRIPLE EDIT: Sorry guys

POSSIBLE LAST EDIT: It seems my wholesaler caught on to what I have been doing and has disabled my whole sale accounts. I can still get things but obviously not at that discount. Unless their website is messing up which I wouldn't doubt. If this is true though I'm a bit annoyed. It's not as if they aren't still making money.

[Okay](http://i.imgur.com/ef9xT0v.jpg) you can take a look.


Just a [TM P226R](http://i.imgur.com/TALiqK7.jpg)

Yes it has the full steel guarder frame and slide installed (with the necessary internal upgrades). Now I need to track down green gas or KJW CO2 mags.

Came with 3 mags

It's a **Hi** capacity case that can carry a good amount of items.

This is actually a gift for someone's birthday that I am currently converting him to airsoft.

Of course it's a [TM 5.1 with a few custom parts.](http://i.imgur.com/9prK8ew.jpg) But the slide is still plastic

1367100390.0,1d8lq1,My thoughts on the grand opening for GI Tactical (East Coast),comandobee,41,2,15,"Today I hit the grand opening for Airsoft GI's new store on the East Coast, and the line was already wrapped around the building! Luckily, won a Condor Plate Carrier from the raffle. I waited about 2.5 hours (including the 45 mins before opening) to get into the store. I did meet some awesome people

They only let 80 people into the store at a time. This reduced the population inside

*First impressions:* 
Wow. It's a pretty large building, different companies and items separated. 

*Stuff:*
Massive gun wall with everything from JGs to VFCs. I was able to handle many guns that I'd never thought about, ASGI Custom VFC MK17 (SCAR-H), and too many others. If they ran out of rifles in the back stockroom, then they'd pick the display model right off, box it, and sell it to you. 

There's a huge section devoted to tactical gear, complete with a company representative. 

Flashlights, and sights/scopes were held in glass display cases. Batteries are held in another case, and are bought at checkout.

*Staff/Transactions/Etc:*
The staff were very very friendly, they were overwhelmed and service was somewhat slow.

The store was very very chaotic. People were running left and right and took a relatively large amount of time to get service.

The lines to checkout were extremely unorganized (4 in total). It was hard to decipher which was which

*Post-Checkout:*
I ended up buying the last VFC HK416 they had (it was the display one). Took a picture with the Elite Force representative there. I left around 2:30
I walked out and got a free swag bag. More patches, and a couple more tote bags. 

*TL;DR/Overview:* It was a chaotic opening, from a massive gun wall to almost half a store of tactical gear. Overall, I'd give them a 9/10. 

If anyone has questions or comments I'll definitely reply when I can. This was a shortened version of my thoughts and experiences.

This is just my little collection. These are all guns I use in the field. I used to have a much more extensive collection but I cut down because they were all just wallhangers.

- KWA CQR MOD 1
- G&amp;G UMG
- WE G17
- A Bat (If all else fails)

I'm currently upgrading the CQR MOD to be somewhat of a DMR. I've already improved air seals and put a type 1 cylinder in. Will be putting in more parts in the future.

The UMG is my CQB gun and performs admirably.

The WE G17 is just too damn cool looking. I had a light on the rail but the battery recently died so I took it off.
I also replaced the outer barrel with a TM one. Looks beautiful.

The bat is if I'm all out. Yup. ",,t5_2qi2x,1365558771.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1c16bn/my_little_collection/

It came with a Javelin M4 and some stuff like a sweatshirt and dead rag and other small things (I used the M4 for a while then sold it) Anyways the sweatshirt came up from the back of my closet,(this was a wayyy early javelin 10x worse than now days ;) ) and to find a old sweatshirt with a logo that i would recognize anywhere now. (kind of the clash between my old newb self and a (unheard of to me at the time) ""milsim logo)  Anyways it gave me a reminder that is very important for airsofters as a whole
