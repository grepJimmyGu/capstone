* Chain restaurants demand their design (cups/plates/bowls, and they're still in stock because you've got commercial restaurants generating enough demand that company still makes them.

* Disposable items come in much higher quantities at much lower prices per unit. Someone linked 2000ft of plastic wrap at $30USD. That's stupid cheap compared to what you'll find at the grocery.

I could go on

**x-posted text follows**

There are actually a few places to buy this stuff online

[webstaurantstore.com](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/) is where my girlfriend and I bought our entire cast iron pan collection, stovetop griddle (also cast iron), HUGE cutting board (the white plastic polymer kind, something like 1.5cm thick), and a whole slew of utensils like measuring cups, etc., for cheaper than any retail outlet, could offer. Had to order it all at once due to the way they handle shipping costs

Their stuff is all what I'd call restaurant quality as well. I have parents lucky and hard working enough to have become wealthy

**edit**
Some folks are saying ""hey don't go buy a huge commercial grade oven/dishwasher/thorium reactor from commercial outlets

I didn't think to include a disclaimer about the massive stuff, rather than the assumption I'm a multimillionaire with a kitchen to make Gordon Ramsay jealous.

BI4L is intended to fill a niche for only high quality and durable products. I plan on being a firm but fair moderator to ensure more signal to noise. Posts should be simple and to the point. Include the link to a place where the product can be bought. Begin the link with [BI4L] to indicate its a product that is from this subreddit. 

Link to websites where there are reputable reviews. I think Amazon is the best place because it is relatively easy to purchase from there and the reviews are somewhat more trustworthy (although there are still fake reviews there too

Second, they could pass for brand new. They don't have a whole hell of a lot of cushion, but they are very comfortable for regular activity.

Olukai is not very BIFL with their non leather sandals, but the neoprene lining wears off at the ball of the foot quite quickly. 

You wouldn't think the color would matter in a sandal, I must admit, have shown to be the pinnacle of BIFL. Both the black ones and the light tan ones have many miles behind them. However, if you buy the black ones, and you're a pasty white guy, they will leave black marks on your feet. This doesn't seem to be a thing that goes away, as my 4 year old black ones still can only be worn when it's not hot enough out to make my feet sweat.

1328827937.0,pigqt,[BI4L Essentials] The Kitchen,WonderLemming,240,31,56,"So awhile ago I made a request [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jzp0o/bi4l_request_can_we_get_a_list_of_essentials_for/) for Essential items for your home. We kicked some ideas around but I've finally decided to try and compile all of the threads I've seen into one helpful resource. Let's get started!

(Disclaimer: I will try to link to the original thread and give credit to OP when possible)

**The Kitchen:**

***Devices that require power***:

1. [Coffee Maker](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/pdx98/bifl_request_coffee_machine/) - The general consensus seems just to buy a French Press, get a moka pot. If you want something electric, the thread has various debates. Also, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lv54v/my_mom_bought_one_ten_years_ago_after_seeing_one/) thread sings the merits of Bunn Coffee Makers. Seems like [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lv54v/my_mom_bought_one_ten_years_ago_after_seeing_one/c2vw3uf) by the OP [Joebobson](http://www.reddit.com/user/JoeBobson) is the most useful. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k7vpm/bi4l_request_french_press/) is a thread specifically discussing French Presses.

2.  [Toaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/pg4jh/bifl_request_toaster/) - Buying a toaster oven seems to be the route one should take. As [noshoesnoshirt](http://www.reddit.com/user/noshoesnoshirt) points out
3.  [Popcorn popper](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/p1e70/bi4l_request_quality_popcorn_popper/) - Consensus: Just use a pot on the stove or a brown paperbag in the microwave
4.  [Crock pot/slow cooker](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/oayfl/bifl_request_a_crock_pot_slowcooker/) - Seems like you want to go for the ""Crock Pot"" brand slow cookers. Allows you to get things cooking while you're at work or school
5.  [Food processor](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/orx70/bifl_food_processor_my_mother_has_used_one_of/) - No consensus that I see.

6.  [Microwave](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lrfqh/bi4l_request_countertop_microwave/) - Microwaves don't seem very BI4L
7. [Waffle Iron](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/l17hj/bi4l_request_waffle_iron/) - Top suggestion by Waffle_House_of_Pain (heh heh) doesn't seem in production anymore.
8.  [Juicer](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jvlho/bifl_champion_commercial_juicer_the_toughest/) - shopcat suggests the [Champion Juicer](http://www.championjuicer.com/product_info.php?cPath=3&amp;products_id=13) and most seem to agree.

***Things that go in a drawer:***

1. [Can opener](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/oqsi6/the_swingaway_can_opener/) - OP suggests the [Swing-A-Way](http://www.amazon.com/Amco-Swing-407WH-Portable-Opener/dp/B0000505IZ) can opener which is currently made in China. If you have issues with that the thread has other great options. [Other](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/mjgx9/bifl_request_can_opener/) [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k9axh/bi4l_request_best_can_opener_either_manual_or/).

2.  [Cheese Grater](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/p877u/chosigt_cheese_grater_499_actually_you_all/) - OP suggests an Ikea grater which was quickly shot down. [This](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Box-Grater/dp/B0007VO0CQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328232212&amp;sr=8-1) by OXO seems to be the highest rated alternative.
3.  [Kitchen Knives](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/k3xe8/bifl_request_kitchen_knives/) - lordjeebus' top comment seems to say it all.
4.  [Bottle Opener](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/npurm/bi4l_request_wine_opener/) - petrus_and_coke suggests a ""waiter's friend"" corkscrew with [this](http://www.amazon.com/Pulltex-Pulltaps-Double-Hinged-Corkscrew-Original/dp/B0055OGPWS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324791190&amp;sr=8-2) as an example.
5. [Pizza Cutter](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/uedrr/bifl_request_pizza_cutter_i_eat_pizza_5x_a_week/) - Phonda points out that you may be cutting your pizza on metal or stone which will dull your pizza cutter after only a few uses. Suggested getting a large,cf.osb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=809&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=9493134017875605927&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ic_HT_frKKP20gHpkanmDw&amp;ved=0CJYBEPICMAE) instead.

***Things that you cook with:***

1. [Cast Iron Pans](http://www.richsoil.com/cast-iron.jsp) - As [paulwheaton](http://www.reddit.com/user/paulwheaton) points out

2.  [Bakewear](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/n35qz/bakeware/) - cykloid suggests the brand Le Creuset and there are suggestions on where to get them (or similar products) inexpensively.

3.  [Baking sheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/ohxqc/bifl_request_looking_for_a_baking_sheet_every/) - Most seem fine but they discuss the merits of silicon baking pads in the thread.

4. [Pots and Such](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lh3ck/bi4l_request_pots_pans/) - More cast iron suggestions to the top but has many other useful suggestions. [lordjeebus' comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/lh3ck/bi4l_request_pots_pans/c2soyvr) again seems to be one of the more useful.

***Misc:***

1. [Cutting Board](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/jw79w/boardsmith_endgrain_butcher_blocks/) - lordjeebus strikes again! This guy is everywhere.
2.

The fasteners holding it together are typical Ikea stuff


Hence, 

* Sand the whole thing
* Varnish the separate parts
* Assemble the stool with the existing fasteners and [liquid nails construction adhesive](http://www.liquidnails.com/products/construction-adhesive-LN903).
* Another coat of varnish. 
* Put [feet on it](http://i.imgur.com/ZrNpsWsh.jpg), make it more quiet, and prevent the wood from splintering when being dragged. 
* Put [non-slip tape](http://i.imgur.com/Huowsash.jpg) on it


Et voila.

Ours has lasted 10 years or so under heavy use (3 kids using it in the kitchen)  and will last many more.  I have seen the same item looking like crap and coming loose etc in other peoples' houses.  A small amount of improvement makes a huge difference and can make a so-so item BIFL.

I didn't see it on Amazon or I would have linked there. This one comes in a bit cheaper than the American Giant hoodie and from what I can tell is made similar. I own the Katahdin

It comes in at $55 total vs $70-$80 for the American Giant. 

I've owned this one for about a year and it still looks new. All the stitches are double or triple stitched with overlapping fabric. Very thick cotton plus thumb holes that are reinforced. The whole thing appears to be designed for outdoor work. It has gusseted under-arms and extra room in the hood.

My favorite part is the zip up collar that is inside the hood. I always hated how wind would blow up into the hoodie and get my neck cold. 

I bought this one to wear anytime and mostly for use as an outer layer while hiking. The water repellent finish comes in handy. (BTW most of those water repellent finishes wear out after about 50 - 100 washings

I got this one before I found out about the American Giant and thought some may want to know about it since it's a little cheaper. I'd probably still buy this one due to the collar inside the hood. If anyone wants close up pictures of the stitching or some part of it just let me know.

Cleaning out my dad's estate we came across a bunch of Ball Jars. Stuff we used to can with growing up 30 years ago. That he got from his mom 30 years before that...

I got to looking at them and there's stuff from Root Mason company. Acquired by Ball in 1918. Assuming they didn't keep producing under that name that means that I have something I am able to can vegetables this fall with something that is almost 100 years old. Those mason jars with the glass lids just need a new gasket.

I've always prefered glass to plastic for storage too. While pyrex bowls still have a plastic lid the rest of it is glass. Even the best tupperware manages to pick up smells and tastes over time.

In college I accidentally set fire to rice in the microwave. Fat fingered an extra 0. I let the thing cool down. I let it soak in water overnight. The chunk of carbon fell out and I still use that bowl. I can't even tell which one it is.

India still reuses old bottles. Every single Coke I had there had been used at least once (and by the looks of them some were probably on 5-10 times around the block). They pay a deposit on the bottle you drink it

Glass is chemically inert. It's why every single chemistry lab in the world uses the stuff. (Unless you want to store your Hydrogen fluoride)

My biggest problem is really figuring out the difference between the 2 Swiss-Gears and the 4 Targus packs. The S-G Pegasus is taller than the Ibex by only an inch, the 17' XL seems to be the largest in interior space, but is it the best choice in other factors, like durability?

I commute by train and then walk 20 minutes to the office (great low stress, wallet, and some pens. I sling the briefcase over my shoulder with the included strap to do this. Unfortunately, the metal parts of the case might not be up to the job of being used with a strap each day. They started to wear through to the base metal quite quickly and once that happened it started eating away at the parts faster than I expected.

Here are some photos of the wear:

* The heavy wear eating into a D ring: http://i.imgur.com/5Xg3fFL.jpg
* Plating worn off a clip and some damage to the base metal: http://i.imgur.com/zOlMCO2.jpg

I would still recommend Saddleback's bags but if you plan on using a shoulder strap often you should consider how the metal parts wear against each other. At some point soon I'll email Saddleback to ask them if the wear is typical. I'm not wild about the thought of having to post it to the far side of the world for rework so I'll probably take it to a saddlemaker near my home for repair.

They have to be durable

They have to have DECENT audio if not better.

1362305458.0,19kl1q,Cherry G80 mechanical-switch keyboard,perpenis,133,33,84,"The Cherry G80-3000 is a mechanical-switch keyboard meaning it has a real switch underneath every single key. Not that rubber crap.
There are three different switch types:

1. Black Switch Linear:
Linear Pressure behavior.

2. Blue Switch Click:
Makes a click sound and has a ""tactile bump"" when you press it.

3. Clear Switch Pressure point:
Has a ""tactile bump"" but no click.

Each key is rated for 50 million key operations. MTBF &gt; 80
These things are sturdy as hell. 
The retro click sound is awesome in my opinion. I have my G80-3000 since about a year now and I really feel in love with it. It feels much better than a standard rubber crap key keyboard. The G80-3000 is also quite inexpensive compared to other mechanical keyboards which mainly use the same switches.

The product name has this meaning btw:

Q = soft = MX Clears

S = klick = MX Blues

P = linear = MX Blacks

G80-3000L(X)C(YY)-(Z)

X = click type (P = linear/black

YY = layout (DE = german

Z = colour (0 =' white

For Example Cherry G80-3000LSCDE-2 is a black click switch keyboard with german layout.

So if you work on your computer a lot I can highly recommend these keyboards. If you code a lot or write a lot it is so nice to have a good keyboard like a G80.

Here are some of my methods.

Clothing - Tug strongly on the seams and collar.  If stretchy

Power tools - Wiggle all parts of it that are wiggle-able.  Look for bearings (not bushings) on all moving parts that matter.  Things that are meant to move should not be able to be moved perpendicular to their designed direction of movement.  Look for big heavy power cords with thick heavy insulation.  Yank on the power cord where it attaches to the tool and look for stretching.  Look for the minimum amount of plastic.  Things that wear should be user-accessible and replaceable.  Read the manual and look for a list of order-able replacement parts and an exploded view drawing.

Shoes - Flex and twist them stoutly.  No visible gaps should appear at the welt of the shoe

Leathergoods - learn the difference between top grain

In general - Drop it on the hard floor of the store.  Oops.  Did it break?  Step on it a few times.  Still good?",,t5_2ss1q,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/onyk9/knowing_something_is_bifl_can_take_a_long_time/

This pack is going to be used regularly for hiking, I'd like less bulk when climbing/scrambling and a way to attach things to the exterior.  I want something bigger than a trail runner and smaller than a ""backpack"" (30L) unless it properly cinches down to accommodate for smaller loads.

The sporting goods stores around me carry packs aimed at hikers that hate pockets or hunters obsessed with the latest camo pattern. A number of ""tactical"" packs seem decent

Looking for the following:

* 20 - 30 L (1220 - 1830 cu in)
* quality fabric &amp; zippers
* slim profile (roughly 19-21"" tall
* Waist &amp; chest straps
* Water bladder compatible
* molle or daisy chains on the front and sides
* preferably 2 compression straps on each side
* internal frame or rigid plastic insert if closer to 30L
* solid color (around town or at the office)

I've read through a bunch of older posts recommending the following.  

* Camelbak HAWG - seems decent, bladder encroaches on storage
* 5.11 12 - seems decent, thick fabric (1050D)
* 5.11 24 - 32L
* GoRuck - $$$$$
* LL Bean - good gear
* Osprey - looked at several
* NorthFace Surge - 32L
* LA Police Gear 3 day - never heard of them

1361584733.0,1923g7,BIFL Review: Caran d'Ache Ecridor Pen/Pencil,that_physics_guy,100,27,47,"Hi guys, and I got the pen for Christmas.  They are basically identical with the obvious exception of one being a pen and the other being a pencil.  In the album I've included at the end

**Cost** - the pen and pencil both cost about the same.  Coming in at about $140 puts these at the high end of the mechanical pencil and ballpoint pen scale.  I make the distinction of pencil and ballpoint pens because fountain pens can go for more than $1k 0_0 That being said

**Build Quality** - these things are fucking tanks.  The body is made out of a solid chunk of brass with a hole drilled down the middle to fit all the writing utensil bits.  These are easily the heaviest writing utensils I own. I don't have a weight estimate

**Ergonomics** - the engraving is not very deep, as much as that pains me to admit. I really like these, but they can be murder on your hand if you are writing for an extended period of time (&gt;2 hours). If you need something well made but more ergonomic, check out the Lamy 2000 (it comes in pen and pencil varieties as well, and can be had for &lt;$100).

**Looks** - they are shiny, and then gave me an even bigger one when I pulled out my Ecridor.  People will notice these pens and pencils.  If you're looking for something more low key, check out the Lamy 2000 I suggested above.

**Writing** - the pencil is superb with the exception of the almost nonexistent eraser.  The inside bits of the pencil are predominantly metal (I don't have pictures, you'll need to look elsewhere.  There is an Ecridor XS which is more or less a midget pencil that uses 0.5mm lead, but it's incredibly short and stubby.  The pen is a different matter.  I can't tell if it's the paper I'm writing on, but the ink delivery is inconsistent.  I write in a few different Moleskine notebooks with my pen (these are where I keep the final versions of my notes for my classes), and it writes like butter in two of them, but a little rough in the others.  The two that it writes well in came in the same package, whereas all the others came in a different package, it does show that the pen is sensitive to the type of paper you're writing on.  I'm still on the included ink cartridge

**Summary** - I really like these, and they look good.  They come in many different engraving styles, so you can find one you like.  I definitely recommend them.

In the dream the company was a small business that builds cars.  When I say small, not GM.  He was having trouble selling to the large movie production companies, because they claimed his cars didn't provide a certain level of value, and he was asking for Reddit's help on ways he could improve this.  In my dream, I imagined large movie production companies (MGM, Paramount) having in-house mechanics and body shops that repair cars used in movies - even dismantling them to the smallest parts - to sell if the vehicle is damaged to the point where it's no longer worth repairing the car.

One of these movie production companies had sent the business owner a letter of rejection because they didn't feel the company's product represented a good enough value when broken down for parts.  My brain came up with the term IPV (Irreducible Part Value) where the movie company determined what the vehicle was worth when completely dismantled

I thought that was an interesting idea, not sure if this is something that should be in the BIFL subreddit.  If not here, then maybe there could be a spinoff subreddit for companies who want to discuss ways to improve their products.

What do you think?  I work nights, be back later.

EDIT: Sorry

* How that balance might play out in the real world

* Because I think it would be smart for someone who owns a BI4L company to ask for help finding ways to make their product better while maintaining the same price point.

1347577552.0,zuik3,"Review of ""Advocate Briefcase"" from Custom Hide",laurencetribe,71,13,30,"I've had [this briefcase](http://www.customhide.com/advocate.html) for about a month and a half. I bought it after seeing a lot of people in this sub-reddit consistently rate Custom Hide as superior to all other leather bag makers

For the most part, there are some glaring problems/concerns I have with my  bag.

1. Brass lock that inevitably gets scratched. It makes no sense to me why the would use materials that have this effect on each other. Perhaps its unavoidable. However it is disappointing that I will have to accept that the brass is going to look like a piece of trash. Here’s a [picture of the brass being scratched](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#0)

2. Some of the internal leather is clearly glued and not stitched. Some of it is already visibly coming apart. The first is of an[ internal zipper pocket](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#2) in the first compartment. The second picture is of what is probably a [facade for the brass hardware](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#3). To be clear
3. On one side of the brass fastener the [leather is not properly secured](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#4). I noticed this the first day I had it. 

4. [Some](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#5) of the [leather](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#6) that [composes](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#7) the handle looks like it is ripping. I don't think that this is growing
5. I’m a relatively short guy, so here’s a [bathroom picture](http://imgur.com/a/PRgyS#8)! 

It might be noteworthy that most of the problems are related to the brass hardware. This feature seems to be the core source of weakness for this bag. I've been considering contacting Custom Hide about these problems

Thanks BIFL! 

Edit 1: Sounds like a lot of people think I should contact Custom Hide to see how they will respond to these issues. I suppose that's a good idea that may benefit me directly and let you all know how iron clad their warranty actually is. I'll shoot them an E-mail tomorrow. 

Edit 2: E-mail has been sent to Custom Hide. I've included a link to this post. I'll let you guys know what their response is. 

Final Edit: As I expected, mention the ripping leather or glue. I think the ripping leather was a minor mistake that is easily resolved, but that those who purchase Custom Hide should expect some of the leather to be bonded to the case with glue. I do not consider this a total deal breaker because of their customer service and the places where glue is used...however it certainly reduces the amount of BIFLness that can be claimed for these bags. I assume the brass fastener that is not full secured is a quick fix for them and not worth mentioning. 

At the end of the day this quote is what makes me stick with Custom Hide: ""If you ever have any issues with your briefcase you would just need to let us know. When we say Lifetime Warranty, our reputation, as well as your satisfaction is our main priority.""

I hope this review serves others looking for a bag. I would still highly recommend this bag to anyone as even the best products have imperfections,False,,t5_2ss1q,1347666704.0,,,t3_zuik3

1328422636.0,pbl03,BIFL: Some thoughts.,pushingHemp,63,9,10,"Just wanted to convey a few thoughts on the subject of owning something for a very long time

1. Maintenance is king. Everything oxidizes, do research, and don't slack. Even the best products will deteriorate quickly if not maintained properly.

2. Keep steel oiled or painted. Use cooking oil on kitchen utensils. Aluminum forms a tough aluminum oxide layer that provides protection. Keep moving parts well oiled. Some parts have grease fittings or small holes for injecting grease/lubrication. Use silicone spray on plastic parts. Metal has more flexible options. Wash your car. It's is more important than you might think. Change oil regularly.

3. Clothes will fade in the sunlight so don't store them in the car or directly in sunlight. Leather should be moisturized- it's skin. Keep shoes polished and protected (silicone, leisure, play) as this can keep clothes that are more reusable in good condition. Replace buttons. Fix seams when possible. Some shoes can have their soles replaced. USE LESS SOAP WHEN WASHING.

4. Keep water away from most items. Or more appropriately

5. Obviously, Sweden, and Switzerland generally have high standards. Italy is a country generally associated with quality, but I can't say that this is 100% consistent. Generally, Italian products carry higher price tags simply because it seems exotic. It's ""art"" in their minds. Not to say they aren't good, just something to consider. Most Chinese manufacturing is poor, but let's be realistic; China can produce some quality products. It really is hit or miss

6. EBAY! Honestly, a power tool will be a better fit, but for minor projects, hand tools are quiet, clean, and will literally last a lifetime or longer.

7. Don't be afraid of artisanal products. Generally

8. RESEARCH! Yes, but branching out into forums is where it's really at. Search for sites specific to the type of product you're looking for.

9. Do it yourself. Seriously. When you learn how to produce your own objects, and how to fix them. You also care about the product more so than if it were bought. It has a sentimental value and you are more likely to fix it. This one has it's limits, but you would seriously be surprised at the number of products that can be made relatively easily by individuals. Even ""industrial items"" such as computers, furniture, and even cars. Takes a little knowledge and skill, but so worth it. Reading the right books allows you to accomplish anything. The internet increases available information exponentially. Might even earn you some money in the long run.

10. Modify. Adding features and fixing flaws can change the game completely. Cast iron pans are sold with very rough surfaces. They can easily be sanded down and made into a MUCH better product. This is a simple example. If you wanted to take it farther, replace parts, etc. This one takes a little creativity, but again, an extremely valuable skill.

11. Pay attention to materials. It might say stainless, leather grades, glass types, etc. Plastic is used in many places it shouldn't be, but there are plenty of applications where it might actually be a better option. Different metals, plastics, and wood all have different maintenance requirements. Is it recyclable? Reusable? I understand this is related to ""maintenance""

12. Keep it simple (KISS). The more shit you have

* Last at least 10 years without becoming tattered/zippers breaking.
* Fit a week's worth of casual clothing/personal effects.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EcsTwyTy6k

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7bl1MII5NM

The only negatives I came across were the price and the weight of the leather.  At $645, and fairly thick, so it's not light like some of the synthetic bags you can buy.

What I didn't find much reference to was the capability of the bag (e.g. how does it handle when loaded up)

When it showed up

The [stitching](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#3) and [details](http://imgur.com/a/rJbMp#4) of the bags construction seem to be of extremely high quality.  I can't imagine breaking this thing without actively trying to destroy it.

The next thing I did was try to load it down to maximum

* Pair of dress shoes.
* Several belts
* 5 T-Shirts
* 2 Dress Shirts 
* 6 Boxers
* 6 Pairs of Socks
* 5 Pairs of Pants (including some bulky jeans).
* 2 Flannel Long-Sleeved Shirts
* 1 Outdoor Jacket
* 1 Sport Jacket
* Dopp Kit/Toiletries

Basically what you'd need for a week long informal business trip in the winter.  The leather cinches/folding works well.  It held all of this without stress, to see how well it works.  It's obviously not the usual mode you'd carry the bag, and you look like a hunchback while doing it, but in a pinch (like when running through an airport to make a plane) I could see it working well.  

**Pros**

Great construction.
Looks fantastic.
Easy to access the contents.
Easy to reconfigure for different uses.

**Cons**

Expensive.
Expensive.
The leather isn't exactly light weight.

I spent many years using bad t-handle hex keys and L-shaped allen wrenches. the cheap keys cam out
the standard socket allen wrench has flat sides. the WERA hex-plus hex keys have concave (dished) flats. they DO not cam out. they bite on the edges, so you dont have to buy a whole set. I have yet to twist one or break the t-handle (even after applying an impact wrench and a cut out socket to the t-handle). like all hex wrenches, if you manage to damage the end, you can just cut down the end  1/4"" or so and you have a brand new wrench.

TL:DR - After 4 years of design and testing

Backstory: I've been working with bicycles for more than 20 years - I've seen the ones that last 15 years and the ones that last 6 months. For the last 4 years I've been designing and stress testing  different components on my new bicycle and I'm planning on launching it this summer.90% of the components are home made using the best aerospace aluminium/steel available. Everything has been ""overengineered"" to make sure the bicycle stays together for atleast 4-5 years before needing any major repair.

How you guys can help: while I've worked on a huge number of bicycles

As the rules say - no untested products. Not advertising

EDIT 1 - clarifications
EDIT 2 - I've worked on Soviet Union bicycles which lasted about 20-30 years with a bottom bracket change(and a few innertube changes). I want to replicate the same quality bicycles that last for ages
The idea is to start with a Single gear city/road bike

As for some people claiming that all bicycles are BIFL - they most certainly are not. A few examples - GT bicycles's frames used to last 5-7 years. They changed their production plant a few years back and after that several bikes have come to my workshop with cracks. I constantly get supermarket/valuemarket bicycles that are literally falling apart after 2 weeks and needs a derailleur
I even managed to break 2 Specialized 4130 steel frames several years back and they were supposed to be ""unbreakable"".
My goal is not to put down any manufacturer or describe problems associated

As for the production run - I'm planning a production run of about 45-50 bicycles this year and the starting price would be around 400-450 euro's. Some people consider it cheap

So, so I do need a bag that can withstand heavy use. I have searched /r/buyitforlife for suitcase requests, and I know that Travelpro was a favorite in an older thread. A couple of reviews on Amazon were conflicting about the quality of the Crew series and mentioned that the FlightCrew series was superior. I haven't had much luck finding these bags, however.

As for specifications, and I hate lugging around a huge bag. I'm considering purchasing a hard shell case, simply because I do use it quite a bit, and I'm not particularly gentle with my bags. I'd like the bag to be between 25-29"", but if anyone can recommend a soft bag that is 21-25"" and expands considerably, I could make that work as well. Ideally, I'd like to spend no more than $150, I will probably have to invest more than that.

Air tools in general can be pretty BIFL compliant and a great investment. If you get the right stuff you can buy  old beat up cheap ones and rebuild them easily. They are inherently tougher and simpler than electric tools.

[This album shows a selection of tools I use.](http://imgur.com/a/FBsQz)

In particular, all good.

This was 10 years ago and I have a lasting high quality tool I know inside and out. Friends come to my house to do their brakes so they can use this and other tools I have

Doing the brakes on your own car saves a butt load of cash

A good medium sized oldish air compressor can have a new motor put on and have the pump rebuilt, you do not want that exploding. Get a really disgusting oily one and inspect it. If you have a large air tank this can be a power buffer for when your power is out.


The rest of the tools shown in the album:

* The IR261 is good for truck suspensions. I got that (cheap) and mildly used from an IR dealer. Where the IR231 is not enough I bring this out

* The IR109XP is the strongest air ratchet on the market. Also tough. I got this cheap and used in a batch

* The air drill I got cheap from aircraft industry surplus for a specific task a while ago and it is handy in various other roles.

* The IR4429 recip saw I got in order to very carefully remove car exhaust systems. Works great for loads of other stuff also.

* The Chicago Pneumatic die grinder likewise

We're at a point where consumerism is becoming a parody of itself for a lot of people. Planned obsolescence and the throwaway nature of our capitalism bleeds into so many other aspects of our culture in a negative way. Our food, politics, entertainment, clothes, and even our friendships appear as though they are as fleeting as the day is long.

I think BIFL can be a piece of the change towards a culture that values craftsmanship, but the economy has been at a point where if we can prove to people that this is a more economical way of living, real change can happen.

So I'm a graphic designer (specifically, I'd have final say on design stuff (not a fan of design by committee.)

The idea for the site is that it would be a highly accesible portal that would curate the best object under a set of specific criteria very similar to the criteria posted here in /r/buyitforlife. Everything would have to be hand-picked.

**So why post about it?**
Like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, workshop, lawn, automotive, home furnishings, clothing, travel, etc.)

There's a lot more to cover

Ok! So that's my idea. I'm interested in any and all feedback that you guys might have. I'm pretty passionate about the underlying concepts of BIFL and in my wildest fantasies

-----------------------------------------------

Hello!

I'm currently looking for a futon to use as a simple

I was curious if anyone had any knowledge about the Savannah Full-Size futon frame from the following locations:

http://www.amazon.com/Full-Size-Savannah-Futon-Sofa/dp/B000JK38O6/

http://www.shop4futons.com/savannah-sofa-bed-futon-frame.html

Both seem to be the same dealer. The frame itself is apparently made by KD Frames:

http://kdframes.com/catalog.php5?id=12&amp;cid=4

What I like is the reasonable prices, I'm not very knowledgeable on wood types. Is poplar a durable wood for this application? The reviews for KD Frames' stuff is pretty good, but I'm skeptical. I'm also worried that the poplar would dent just by looking at it wrong, but that is probably an unreasonable thought... considering all I've been able to find are janka hardness scores for various woods which I'm unable to apply to real-world furniture scenarios:

http://ejmas.com/tin/2009tin/tinart_goldstein_0904.html

An alternative for me would be to spend $250 - $300 for a rubberwood frame from my local futon store

I was thinking of getting an Otis Haley 110 to go on it

They aren't the smallest headphones in the world, using at your desk at work/around the office, that sort of thing, these are *awesome*.

I got mine I believe in 2008 and they look, thrown in bags, bent up and squished between things and still are kicking just fine.

I consider them the best tech purchase I ever made since they still work perfectly and I always have a use for them. 

 The internal battery holds a very long charge and you can use them for hours and hours.  The stats say 11 hours of use and 210 standby hours.  I have definitely left them in standby for days by accident then used them for hours more.

I of course would hesitate to put modern electronics into the BIFL category but so far these things have been sitting around my desk and in my bags as my go-to headphone for home and office use since 2008.

They also have a microphone built in for use on the phone.  Since it is a stereo headset I find that this makes for excellent use for long phone calls.  I've made many a business call pacing around my room using these.

I've used them a little for athletic purposes but generally I prefer to use something in-ear for that since I want to completely drown out the outside world when I am working out.
