As a chemistry student I wanted to dig a little bit more into alchemy for my own personal curiosity but also as a way to reconcile spiritualism with science in my own little mind.

What I discovered was slightly unnerving. sit down kids.

So in the 1500's, botanist, alchemist, astrologer, and general occultist. ) was up to some very nifty stuff in terms of psychotherapy and new medical practise's alongside creating the field of toxicology.

Following [hermetical philosophy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Caduceus.svg/170px-Caduceus.svg.png) he pioneered the use of chemicals/minerals into remedies.
He firstly defined poison and its interaction with diseases
 
He birthed the idea that diseases/illnesses were caused by dis-balances in the body's chemicals/minerals/""poisons""

**==&gt;But onto the crispy stuff...** This medical geniuse's birth name was actually Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus ( He might have given us the word BOMBASTIC

The man was an accomplished physician and alchemist

And he attempted to create it by combining horse dung and human semen in a little flask and proceeded to heat it for 40 days

In fma the [Homunculus](http://25.media.tumblr.com/523418fb652195e192ae6d2dc7501c8c/tumblr_mipgfn160x1rryen0o1_500.png) was created similarly from the blood of hohenheim,which are life energies of people.
Well in the real world

**TL'DR** The father of modern medicine attempted to create the actual Dwarf in the flask with horse poop

We walked up there and asked and when the attendant turned to get the paper with the schedule, trying to keep from freaking out. I'm surprised I did not break it.

We weren't buying anything and yet he stood with us for a fifteen minute conversation. He asked us questions, who was in broadcasting school and is hoping to be a voice actor some day. He also asked me if I had the Conqueror of Shambala movie, since I had mentioned I wanted him to sign a movie. I told him no, that I hadn't been able to find it anywhere and at that time i had no credit card so couldn't order it. Finally a bunch of people came up to his line so he let us go, making us promise to be back the next day.

Before we finished at the convention that day, the first words he said was ""You came back!"" he remembered us, even though this time we were completely dressed up. Then he saw me with two movies and brought up me saying I didn't have the first movie the day before. I told him I had found it at one of the tables and bought it just so i could have both movies signed.

We handed over the money and I got my movies signed, and then he also did the voice of Ed for the two of us. He whispered them in our ears, each of us got our own lines.

It was amazing. One of the best experiences I have ever had. I never got a Christian line

TL;DR: Vic knew that my girlfriend and I were gay and together. He never gave us one christian line. During the weekend of the C4 con

* Pride is willing to take a human body after despising them.
* Gluttony is himself eaten.
* Greed is satisfied with what he had in his life.
* Wrath is happy with the life he lived.
* Envy is so envious of humans he ends his own life.
* Sloth actually tries to use his full potential but is too late.

If any of you are really into the dub version I can get an autograph. I don't want to be a burden and bring him too many autographs to sign but he told me his brother would do a few. Its free of charge so if you want to send me a FMA dvd/blue ray I'll have it signed for you and send it back (you just pay for the shipping if you are far away. If you are interested PM me and I will give you my address so you can send a DVD or something of FMA.

Please remember nothing big and in bulk (preferably FMA DVD's). the golf lessons I'm taking are 1200.00 bucks and its just a small favor that he offered me. I dont need to make any money off of this so its free

Mind you, but pretty much. Now time for some quick questions, so I can clear stuff up. (Spoilers ahead!)

1.) What is the purpose of the Gate of Truth? Obviously

2.) Does each Alchemist have his/hers own Gate? Considering that Ed destroyed just his own

3.) What did the being inside the Gate mean about the ""two"" sides? Was one like an entrance

4.) Did the pictures at the end indicate that Mustang went on to become Fuhrer and that Ed and Winry had children together?

and finally
5.) Your own opinions on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood?

Now at that time I wasn't aware of Brotherhood

So there I was, sadness, amusement; it was a rollercoaster of awesomeness. By then I had done some more research online and I had began to hear more and more about Brotherhood. At first I was interested, I knew eventually I had to see it. Then I started to almost resent people just raving about, and giving no love to the original series I was falling in love with. After a while I had to stop visiting this subreddit all together, because it was just a non-stop mine field of spoilers, and I didn't my opinion of Brotherhood clouded any more. All I knew was that it was awesome, how awesome could it be? surely they couldn't have out done the original series that much

Fast forward, I'm kinda wary about just watching things online, so I figured I'd buy it when I had the chance. But whenever I had money the store was sold out, and when I was broke they always seemed to have it. It was taunting me. Finally I gave in, and pulled it up online.

The first few episodes, and people were just crazy. A few more episodes in I started seeing the changes in story, but not only that, I also started seeing the level of character development they had put into Brotherhood that just wasn't there in the original. Their emotions were more intense, and therefore so were mine. I also saw how much more the relationships were built up over time, and I was eager to see how it all turned out.

Finally I was into the meat of the story, and the last of the credits rolled by, I just sat there with a deep sense of completion. The original left me wanting more, but Brotherhood had the right amount of everything, and I just felt ""whole"" at the end. I remember looking down at my DVDs of the original series and thinking that I would never be able to watch it again. I had been so obsessed with Fullmetal Alchemist when I first saw it, and all the times after that, but now that I had finally seen Brotherhood there was no way I could go back to the original.

I'm not sure what else I can say. Do I regret watching the original series? Honestly, then Brotherhood. I hope people find this review helpful, and I hope there are other people out there who feel the same way.

I'm still a little biased towards the original Anime, it was very much breezing through a lot, and expected viewers to have seen the first series or read the manga. It took some of the spot-light away from the Elrics, and the Ishvallan massacare, and rather shared it with the other prolific characters like Mustang, Riza, Hohenheim, as compared to the original series. It wasn't just a constant darkness, I was awe-struck. I had no words. While the ending of the first anime was decent

The thing that bugged me the most was the soundtrack. The first series brought something very beautiful with their music. Every single track for me was memorable, Trisha's Lullaby, Resembool's Lullaby, to name a few). But the main theme, in my opinion was lacking when compared next to *Bratja* from the first series. That song was more than just beautiful, and the amount of plays on my iTunes is a testament to that. Other than that, I really hated the over-the-top humor in some scenes. Brotherhood was very careful with this its use of humor, and deathly seriousness of the original FMA. But nose-bleeds

All in all, they are two very different beings. I was quick to judge Brotherhood in the middle of watching it, and I shouldn't have been so bashful. The end was a real treat, and made me miss those two damn brother so much, along with Hohenheim. I don't know, I liked Hohenheim of Light more than Van Hohenheim. Maybe I just like men of tragedy, those who know their future is doomed, I'm happy I got to enjoy these stories in my life-time. I hope to buy all of them really soon and add them to my already large FMA collection. This is something I really want to share with the future generations. ",t5_2t27s,True

So after rewatching the original anime all over again for the 5th time I decided to watch Brotherhood for once. The original anime I really liked because the homunculi all had personality and story,( )

But when I finally decided to watch Brotherhood without stopping I realized some things that I should of realized when I first attempted to watch it. This is a different anime with a similar characters but a different story so the chronology of how the events transpire will be different before the diverging point. As well they decided to speed through the story in 12 episodes which took more than twice as much for the original because they didn’t want to repeat some of the stories of the original and they were getting to a much bigger and better story.

After the diverging point I instantly got hooked even more than the original and couldn’t stop watching. This is a list of everything that was amazing in Brotherhood which was not in the original

- All of Mustang’s squad is used more and more integral to story instead of being comedic characters that are just there.
- The edition of the residents of Xing was just awesome. May and Greed-Ling were not only hilarious but awesome.
- Showing more of the world by showing the North and other places made it feel a lot bigger.
- Everyone of Briggs and their soldiers were badass
- The use of all the supporting characters of the show. There were a lot more supporting characters in Brotherhood compared to the original and they were actually used a lot more than the original. There were more fights then the original where the Elric Brothers either had support or were not even in the fight. 
- they actually had a coup that was a gigantic battle. In the original I was disappointed there wasn’t a huge battle of Mustang and allies taking central but in Brotherhood they had exactly what I wanted. A gigantic city fight that actually ended with them taking central command and not just a fake coup that took focus away from Mustang. 
- An actual sense of urgency where the main conflict had to be stopped because it affected the whole entire land instead of just the brothers and some of the side characters. 
- A final epic fight that had most of the characters fighting a big bad and working together to take it down. The first didn’t have that ending fight that I wanted and this reason and the two above made the first anime feel rushed. 
- The ending of Brotherhood had a lot more closure and optimism compared to the first anime. I felt satisfied with the ending instead the first where I wanted more. 
- Finally Winry and Ed actual end up together! I was incredibly mad that the first anime and the movie that acted as more closure ended with Ed not ending up with Winry. When I watched Brotherhood I was so happy that they actually had a relationship.

To finish I like both animes and they both deserved to be watched. They are both incredibly good in their own right. The original is still amazing and part of the TV I grew up on but Brotherhood did everything that I felt was left out of the first anime. After binge watching both all I want is to rewatch because they are amazing!",self,t5_2t27s,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/FullmetalAlchemist/comments/1hewh6/after_binge_watching_brotherhood_here_is_why_i/

1370149320.0,1fi6uv,I just finished brotherhood and...,Dartht33bagger,24,12,12,"I have to say that I liked the original series more.  Sure

 Things I liked better about FMA:

* I felt like Scar and Al had better voices.  In brotherhood, but at times Al's voice did sound like a womans voice (especially when there was a lot of emotion in his voice).  These are minor things, but I thought I'd point them out.

* The art style.  I watched brotherhood right after FMA and I instantly noticed a decrease in the detail of the characters.  While the backgrounds and environments still looked pretty good

* One of my favorite parts about FMA's storyline was that the homunculi came from failed human transmutations.  When the topic was first brought up in the show, Lust with Scar, Wrath with Izumi).  

* I really liked Lust in FMA.  Towards the end of the show, so she almost doesn't exist.

* Scar's final plan was great.  I could have never seen Al turning into a philosophers stone.

What I liked in Brotherhood:

* Mustang was more important in this one.  He played a pivotal role in the story from the middle of the show onward.

* Ed went after Winry.  Why he didn't do it in FMA is beyond me.  

* The names of the homunculi actually make sense in Brotherhood.  In FMA

* The ending in Brotherhood was much better.  It closed up the story nicely and had an exciting final battle.

Just wanted to get this off my chest while the series was fresh in my mind.

1344183788.0,xpvj5,Why I loved the 2003 series more. (RANT),BlackLock-,11,2,6,"Ok

1 - Alchemy: In the 2003 series, the Gate could be studied. And while I'm on that subject, I liked the Gate more in the 2003 series. I thought it made more sense. I liked how to create a direct link you took something from one side that wasn't supposed to be there and used it to open the door (like how the Nazi's use Envy and Hohenheim to establish a direct link rather than having to travel through the ""truth""). In Brotherhood, the Alchemy came across as more of a magic than a science. 

2 - On that note, its ridiculous. It's like, this is a stone that alchemists have been seeking since the birth of the science itself, and here the military is mass-producing it. And seeing as how the object of Ed and Al's search is the stone itself, it seemed pretty stupid to me to make it so easy for them to get. In the 2003 series, the stone was near-impossible to create. And using those pseudo-stones that Marco created or the red water that the Impostor Kids were studying was very dangerous. In Brotherhood, you could make a stone with 10 people. It didn't seem like a big deal. In the 2003 series,000 people were the MINIMUM to create a true stone. 

3 - The homunculi were probably one of my biggest reasons. In Brotherhood, plagued by the memories of who they were supposed to be. It made them tragic, but above all else, it made them *human*. Especially Lust and Sloth. Even the method for creating a Homunculus made sense; a failed human transmutation. Giving them the stones gave them form. And because they came from the Gate, they had super-human abilities. It made sense. And for the most part, they actually lived out their names. Especially the 2003 Sloth, Pride and Envy. Gluttony was the same in both series' (I will point out that the reason Gluttony turned into that monster in the 2003 series movie, especially when it hits you that that is why Envy hates Ed and Al so much; he hates them because his own father abandoned him for those boys. 

4 - Next up is Hughes. I hated the way they dealt with this in Brotherhood. He's only with you for a couple of episodes and then he dies, and ultimately his only purpose was to die so that it'd give Mustang a reason to go ape shit at Envy and have that stupid moment with Scar, Hawkeye and Ed lecturing him. In the 2003 series, you have the time to form an attachment to Hughes. And on top of all that, his actions are actually important. He was the first to discover the truth about the Fuhrer's secretary and because of his death, the Homunculi had to cover their actions more carefully. Hughes' death made sure that the enemy had to tread on eggshells for the rest of the series. 

5 - Misc. points: I liked how tragic the 2003 series was. How Yoki lost everything and then, because of the same reason: he tried so hard to do good to balance out all of the evils he did in the past, and instead he ends up handing Ed the secrets of the stone and getting killed. I like how Mustang is the one who killed the Rockbells in the 2003 series, because it adds depth to Mustang's character. His image of the strong, leader slowly dissolves throughout the series to that of a man broken by what he did in his past, trying desperately to become a good, honest person. And it's not like in Brotherhood where he was a soldier who killed enemy soldiers, he killed unambiguously good people. In Brotherhood almost everyone ends up with a happy ending and it completely undermines the concept of sacrifice and redemption. The fact that some people get completely shafted by the world like Marcoh

6 - Ed and Al's maturity. In Brotherhood Edward doesn't really mature. Al does, to a naive child, who's innocence slowly twiddles away, he goes from the boy who cried and freaked out over killing Greed to the man who killed Sloth without even thinking twice while she was wearing the face of his own mother. You end up feeling bad for Edward. You watch the 2003 series thinking ""fuck this kid's gonna need some therapy when all this is over"".  And on the note of Ed and Al, Hohenheim is more of a tragic figure as well. A man scared of death and hopelessly in love with Dante, and when he finally comes to terms with the fact that he's a prick and no amount of good doing will change that, he decides to leave Dante and falls for Trisha. And the fact that Hohenheim gets scared of Trisha finding out his past and runs away makes Hohenheim more realistic. 

7 - Finally, was an idiot, his plan was sloppy irregardless of what Pride says, and he just doesn't seem as powerful as everyone makes him out to be. In the 2003 series, Dante was an incredible villain. A girl who was once innocently in love and perhaps overly ambitious, who fears death. As she grows older she is corrupted by the power of the stone and her mind becomes warped and tainted as she realizes just how many people she's killed, until she becomes so warped that she loses every part of her ""self"" until only the fear of death remains. She is actually so misguided as to believe she is the shepard of humanity. Her opinions and views make her feel more human

I recently finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and enjoyed it quite thoroughly. I am looking for some suggestions for what to watch next and will describe below what I have seen and liked so far.


Death Note - The first anime I watched. I was totally blown away. I had never seen anything quite like it before. Kira hunting L. L hunting Kira. It was fascinating to watch. I was on the edge of my seat the entire show.


Ghost in the Shell - I haven't watched the movies


Fullmeatl Alchemist: Brotherhood - I don't know what it is about this show


There are a couple things I have noticed about what I like in an anime:

* I like when the full story arc is out there. Look at the ones I have watched already. All of them are less than 70 episodes. I don't really want to get into a long-running series like Bleach or Naruto.
* I like them to keep, but I don't like when they do [things like this](http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/1858/izumi3.gif). It breaks the immersion for me. I think I enjoyed Death Note, GitS, and FMA:B partly because they kept this kind of thing to a minimum
* I watched Death Note originally with an English sub

*1) Viridian (single DVD volumes) vs original (single DVD volumes)* 

From what I read

*2) Viridian (box set) vs Viridian (single DVD volumes)*

Does the box set have more features?

And what does the inside of the box set look like? (To be honest I prefer the single DVDs because of their cover art.)

I was wondering mostly about Wrath's place in the whole overarching story. From the beginning he seems like a really funny/trollish leader who turns out to be a conflicted bad guy thrust into carrying out his creator's plan for the world. As the show went on I was certain he would somehow end up betraying his ""Father"" and choosing to spend life with his wife. Obviously that's not what happened as he completely went berserk against any humans opposite him. He died with an extreme distaste towards humans in every way. Basically I was very surprised and just wondered what other people thought of him. I just assumed the wrath that was injected into him was what got the better of him in the end.

The only thing I wasn't so sure about Lust was basically that she didn't seem to have a lust for anything. Obviously she wasn't around for long

Basically looking back I can really only see Wrath as a super tragic villain and Lust not really having any importance(despite having a crazy death scene from Mustang lol).
